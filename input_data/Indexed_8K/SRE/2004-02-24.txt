Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
Net Income Increases 10 Percent to $649 Million in 2003
Earnings Per Share Rise 6 Percent to $3.03 in 2003
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 24, 2004 -- Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported 2003 earnings of $649 million, or $3.03 per diluted share, up 6 percent per share over 2002 earnings of $591 million, or $2.87 per share. Excluding unusual items in both years, earnings per share increased to $2.93 from $2.73 in 2002.
For the fourth quarter 2003, Sempra Energy reported earnings of $234 million, or $1.03 per share, up 43 percent per share over fourth-quarter 2002 earnings of $148 million, or $0.72 per share. Excluding unusual items, fourth-quarter 2003 earnings were $160 million, up 9 percent from $147 million in the fourth quarter 2002.
Unusual items affecting the company's fourth-quarter results included a benefit of $118 million due to favorable tax settlements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46, addressing the consolidation of variable interest entities, reduced Sempra Energy's fourth-quarter 2003 earnings by $17 million. The company also recorded a $21 million impairment charge related to its investment in Atlantic Electric & Gas, a U.K.-based retail energy marketer, and a $6 million charge for litigation costs related to the California energy crisis of 2000 to 2001.
A detailed reconciliation of earnings and all unusual items in the fourth quarter and full year 2003 and 2002 follows (Table F) and is available on the company's Web site, www.sempra.com.
"We achieved record financial results for Sempra Energy in 2003 and enhanced our already strong balance sheet," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy. "Since the company was formed in 1998, we have been successful in growing our earnings per share by an average of nearly 20 percent annually.
"We expect continued solid earnings performance from our two California utilities and are moving toward the successful resolution of their respective rate cases. Earnings from our Sempra Energy Global Enterprises energy-infrastructure and risk-management businesses increased about 30 percent in 2003 from 2002, excluding unusual items. We continue to make progress in our liquefied natural gas (LNG) import business. We expect to bring online by 2007 the first two new LNG receipt terminals in North America in more than two decades."
Sempra Energy's 2003 revenues were $7.9 billion, compared with 2002 revenues of $6 billion. The rise in revenues was due primarily to growing power deliveries by Sempra Energy Resources and higher commodity prices at the California utilities. Sempra Energy's fourth-quarter 2003 revenues were $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the year-earlier period.
SUBSIDIARY OPERATING RESULTS
San Diego Gas & Electric
Net income for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) rose to $334 million in 2003 from $203 million in 2002, primarily due to the favorable resolution of income-tax issues in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter 2003 net income for SDG&E more than doubled to $128 million from $53 million during the same period in 2002. SDG&E's fourth-quarter net income included $79 million from the tax settlement.
SDG&E's 2003 results also reflected a previously reported $65 million after-tax gain for a litigation settlement with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). This was offset by an after-tax charge of $11 million for litigation costs. SDG&E's 2002 net income included a one-time gain of $25 million related to other income-tax settlements.
Southern California Gas Co.
Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) earned $209 million in 2003, compared with $212 million in 2002. Fourth-quarter 2003 net income for SoCalGas increased to $61 million from $45 million in the fourth quarter 2002. SoCalGas' fourth-quarter net income included $29 million from the tax settlement with the IRS.
SoCalGas' 2003 results included a $32 million reduction to net income related to litigation costs and a one-time charge related to a sublease.
On Dec. 19, 2003, SoCalGas filed an all-party settlement and SDG&E, a multi-party settlement, of their rate cases with the CPUC. The CPUC is expected to issue rulings in the cases later this year.
Sempra Energy Trading
Sempra Energy Trading's net income in 2003 was $98 million, compared with $126 million in 2002.
In the fourth quarter 2003, Sempra Energy Trading earned $59 million, up from $53 million in the year-earlier period, which included a $14 million extraordinary gain from the acquisition of the metals business. The increase was due primarily to strong results in the company's crude oil, petroleum products and metals trading.
Results in 2003 included a $28 million negative cumulative-effect adjustment in the first quarter related to the adoption of EITF 02-3, an accounting principle that eliminated mark-to-market accounting for certain commodity trading assets and liabilities, delaying revenue recognition.
Sempra Energy Resources
Sempra Energy Resources' net income in 2003 rose to $94 million from $60 million in 2002. Fourth-quarter 2003 net income for Sempra Energy Resources was $46 million, compared with break-even results in 2002. Fourth-quarter 2003 results included a $9 million one-time positive adjustment related to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46.
The rise in net income for Sempra Energy Resources for both the fourth quarter and full year 2003 was due primarily to increased power deliveries under the company's long-term supply contract with the California Department of Water Resources. In 2003, Sempra Energy Resources brought online new power plants near Bakersfield, Calif., Mexicali, Mexico, and Phoenix, Ariz., totaling 2,125 megawatts.
Sempra Energy International
Net income for Sempra Energy International in 2003 was $1 million, versus $26 million in 2002. Results for 2003 included a charge of $50 million in the third quarter related to the impairment of assets of Frontier Energy, a North Carolina-based gas utility subsidiary.
In the fourth quarter 2003, Sempra Energy International earned $8 million, compared with a $4 million loss in the year-earlier period.
Absent the third-quarter charge in 2003, Sempra Energy International's results for the year and quarter improved, primarily due to a full year of earnings contribution from the Gasoducto Bajanorte gas pipeline in Baja California, Mexico, which began operations in late 2002, and increased earnings from the company's utility interest in Chile.
Sempra Energy LNG
On Dec. 22, 2003, Sempra Energy LNG and Shell International Gas Limited announced their intention to form a 50/50 joint venture to build, own and operate the Energa Costa Azul LNG receipt terminal in Baja California. The proposed joint venture will combine the two separate Baja California receipt terminals proposed by Shell and Sempra Energy LNG into a single project. Ground-breaking for the project remains on schedule for later this year with operational start-up planned for 2007.
On Dec. 18, 2003, Sempra Energy LNG announced a preliminary agreement with BPMiGas and British Petroleum for the supply of 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Indonesia's Tangguh LNG liquefaction facility to Sempra Energy LNG's receipt terminal in Baja California.
Permitting of Sempra Energy LNG's Cameron LNG receipt terminal in Louisiana is complete and construction is scheduled to begin later this year, with operations planned for 2007.
Sempra Energy Solutions
Sempra Energy Solutions earned $16 million in 2003, compared with $21 million in 2002. In the fourth quarter 2003, the company earned $9 million, compared with $10 million in the same quarter in 2002.
