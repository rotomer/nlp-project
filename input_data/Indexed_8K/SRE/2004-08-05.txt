News Release
 
Electric-Generation, Energy--Trading Units Lead Solid Performance in Quarter
Company on Track to Meet 2004 Earnings Guidance of $2.90 to $3.10 per Share
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 5, 2004 -- Sempra Energy today reported unaudited second-quarter 2004 earnings of $121 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $116 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the same period of 2003.
For the first six months of 2004, Sempra Energy's earnings increased 56 percent to $318 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, from $204 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, during the first six months of 2003. Net income for Sempra Energy Resources and Sempra Energy Trading more than doubled during the first half of 2004 to a combined $158 million from $60 million during the same period last year.
"With our electric-generation and energy-trading businesses performing significantly better than last year, plus the continued solid results of our California utilities, Sempra Energy is on track to meet our 2004 earnings guidance of $2.90 to $3.10 per share," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy. "We also are moving forward with our liquefied natural gas (LNG) business. Site preparation will begin this month on Sempra Energy LNG's Mexican LNG receipt terminal, Energa Costa Azul, and we are finalizing the supply agreement."
In June, Sempra Energy raised its 2004 earnings guidance to $2.90 to $3.10 per share from $2.70 to $2.90 per share to reflect the company's improved business outlook.
Sempra Energy's second-quarter 2004 net income rose on higher profits at Sempra Energy Resources, Sempra Energy Trading and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas), but earnings per share were affected by a greater number of common shares outstanding.
Second-quarter 2004 earnings included an $8 million loss related to the discontinuance of Atlantic Electric & Gas, a U.K.-based energy marketer, which was sold in April 2004. The first six months of 2004 included a loss of $32 million related to the discontinued operations Atlantic Electric & Gas.
Revenues for Sempra Energy were $2 billion in the second quarter 2004, compared with $1.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, due primarily to increased power sales by Sempra Energy Resources. For the first half of the year, Sempra Energy's revenues increased to $4.4 billion in 2004 from $3.8 billion in 2003.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS Sempra Energy Utilities
Net income for SoCalGas rose to $50 million during the second quarter 2004 from $37 million in the year-earlier period, due to higher operating revenues.
Net income for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) in the second quarter 2004 was $30 million, compared with $41 million in last year's second quarter. The decrease primarily stemmed from the elimination of SDG&E's revenue incentive mechanism for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, in which the utility holds a 20-percent ownership stake.
During the quarter, SDG&E received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission for its regional energy reliability plan. Under the approved plan, SDG&E will acquire a new 550-megawatt (MW), natural gas-fired power plant -- called Palomar Energy -- being developed in Escondido, Calif., by sister company Sempra Energy Resources. Construction on Palomar Energy, which began last month, is expected to be completed in 2006. The utility also will contract for renewable energy resources and plans to enter into a 10-year power-purchase agreement for up to 570 MW of electricity.
Sempra Energy Trading
On the strength of increased profitability of its petroleum and metals trading operations, Sempra Energy Trading's net income increased to $40 million during the second quarter 2004 from $35 million in the same period last year. Through the first half of 2004, Sempra Energy Trading's net income totaled $99 million, compared with $45 million in net income during the first six months of 2003.
During the quarter, Sempra Energy Trading completed a $1 billion, two-year committed credit facility to help finance its global operations.
Sempra Energy Resources
Sempra Energy Resources reported sharply higher net income of $22 million in the second quarter 2004, up from $5 million in the second quarter last year. The rise in net income was due to increased power sales from several new power plants that were put into full operation during the past year.
In the second quarter 2004, Sempra Energy Resources delivered nearly 3.9 million megawatt-hours of power under contracted agreements. The company expects to deliver substantially more power during the second half of 2004.
Last month, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy Resources assumed management of Coleto Creek Power Station, a 632-MW coal-fired Texas power plant, and eight other Texas power plants jointly acquired on a 50-50 basis from American Electric Power by Sempra Energy Partners and Carlyle/Riverstone. The $430 million acquisition, which was completed July 1, 2004, was substantially project-financed. Sempra Energy's share of equity in the transaction was $53 million.
Sempra Energy International and Sempra Energy LNG
Net income for Sempra Energy International and Sempra Energy LNG, on a combined basis, was $15 million in this year's second quarter, versus $18 million in the second quarter 2003. Tax reserves and increased development costs were offset partially by improved results in the company's Mexican operations and by the sale of a portion of the common stock in its jointly owned Luz del Sur unit in Peru.
