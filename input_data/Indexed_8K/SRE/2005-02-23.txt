NEWS RELEASE
 
Earnings Per Share Rise 26 Percent to $3.83
Commodity-Trading, Electric-Generation Units Pace Growth
Company Raises 2005 Earnings-Per-Share Guidance to $3.10 to $3.30 From $3.00 to $3.20
          SAN DIEGO, Feb. 23, 2005 - Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported 2004 earnings of $895 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, up 38 percent over 2003 earnings of $649 million, or $3.03 per diluted share.
          For the fourth quarter 2004, Sempra Energy's earnings were $346 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, an increase of 48 percent over fourth-quarter 2003 earnings of $234 million, or $1.03 per diluted share.
          "This marks the sixth consecutive year of record earnings for Sempra Energy, a period during which we have averaged earnings growth of more than 20 percent annually," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman and chief executive officer. "In 2004, we further strengthened our balance sheet and significantly advanced our liquefied natural gas (LNG) business. Our commodity-trading and electric-generation businesses experienced robust growth and our California utilities continue to excel."
 
          Yesterday, Sempra Energy's board of directors announced a dividend increase of 16 percent, raising the quarterly dividend on common shares to 29 cents ($1.16 on an annualized basis). The increase was the first change in the company's dividend since 2000.
          Revenues for Sempra Energy in 2004 were $9.4 billion, compared with $7.9 billion in 2003, due to increased power sales and commodity trading. Fourth-quarter 2004 revenues were $2.9 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the year-earlier period.
SUBSIDIARY OPERATING RESULTS
Sempra Utilities
          
Net income for Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) increased to $232 million in 2004 from $209 million in 2003, due primarily to lower operating expenses, the favorable settlement of its rate case at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and a one-time gain from a property sale. Fourth-quarter 2004 net income for SoCalGas was $58 million, versus $61 million in the year-earlier period.
          
Net income for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) in 2004 was $208 million, compared with $334 million in 2003. SDG&E's net income was $68 million in the fourth quarter 2004, compared with $128 million in the same quarter of 2003. In the fourth quarter 2004, SDG&E benefited from the settlement of its rate case at the CPUC. The 2003 results for SDG&E included a $79 million gain recorded in the fourth quarter for the favorable resolution of tax issues and a $65 million gain recorded in the third quarter for a contract settlement with the CPUC.
          
In December 2004, the CPUC approved base rates for SDG&E and SoCalGas for a four-year period extending through 2007.
          
"The approval of new rate plans for SDG&E and SoCalGas ensures that our utilities will continue to earn a reasonable return as they invest in critical new infrastructure to serve their customers," Baum said.
 
Sempra Commodities
          
In 2004, net income for Sempra Commodities (formerly Sempra Energy Trading) more than doubled to $320 million from $157 million in 2003, due to improved performance in all of its key commodity segments worldwide, including natural gas, petroleum and base metals. Fourth-quarter 2004 net income for Sempra Commodities increased to $171 million from $73 million in the year-earlier period on the strength of its natural gas and power trading.
          
"In 2004, Sempra Commodities recorded its best year ever," said Baum. "Quarter after quarter, Sempra Commodities has remained consistently profitable, while carefully managing risk and entering into transactions that convert to cash quickly."
Sempra Generation
          
Net income for Sempra Generation (formerly Sempra Energy Resources) rose to $137 million in 2004 from $71 million in the previous year, due primarily to a full year of contributions from the company's new generating fleet in the Pacific Southwest, as well as power plants acquired in Texas.
          
Sempra Generation's fourth-quarter net income was $19 million in 2004, compared with $32 million in 2003, due primarily to litigation reserves.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage
          
Sempra Pipelines & Storage (formerly Sempra Energy International) recorded net income of $63 million in 2004, up from $3 million in 2003. Results for 2003 included an impairment charge of $50 million in the third quarter. In 2004, Sempra Pipelines & Storage also benefited from a $5 million gain from reducing its ownership in Luz del Sur, a Peruvian utility, to 38 percent from 44 percent. For the fourth quarter, net income for Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased to $28 million in 2004 from $10 million in 2003, due primarily to favorable resolution of foreign-tax issues.
Sempra LNG
          
Last month, Sempra LNG (formerly Sempra Energy LNG) awarded the engineering and construction contracts for its Energa Costa Azul and Cameron LNG receipt terminals in Baja California, Mexico, and Louisiana. Construction has commenced on the Energa Costa Azul terminal, which is expected to be operational in 2008.
          
Also last month, Sempra LNG was awarded a 15-year natural gas contract to supply Mexico's state-owned electric utility, Comisin Federal de Electricidad.
          
On Jan. 27, 2005, Sempra LNG announced it had signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) to provide Tractebel LNG North America LLC with up to one-third of the processing capacity of the Cameron LNG receipt terminal for a period of 20 years, beginning in 2008. The non-binding HOA contemplates finalizing a definitive agreement by June 30, 2005. Additional supply and capacity agreements involving Cameron LNG are being negotiated. The facility is expected to be operational in 2008.

          Sempra Energy today updated its 2005 earnings-per-share guidance to $3.10 to $3.30 from previous guidance of $3.00 to $3.20. The company also announced a capital budget of approximately $1.6 billion for 2005.
