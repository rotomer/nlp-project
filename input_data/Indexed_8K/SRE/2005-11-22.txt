Item 8.01 Other Events
As previously reported, on November 16, 2005 the Attorney General of California indicated that he expected to receive a referral from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to bring an action against Sempra Energy and its subsidiaries relating to alleged curtailments in the natural gas markets.
On November 21, 2005 the Attorney General and the CPUC filed a lawsuit against Sempra Energy and its California utility subsidiaries, Southern California Gas Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company, in San Diego County Superior Court alleging that in 1998 Sempra Energy and the California utilities had intentionally misled the CPUC in ultimately obtaining CPUC approval to use the utilities' California natural gas pipeline capacity to enable Sempra Energy's non-utility subsidiaries to deliver natural gas to a power plant in Mexico. It further alleges that, as a result of insufficient utility pipeline capacity to serve both the power plant and California customers, San Diego Gas & Electric Company curtailed natural gas service to electric generators and large California commercial and industrial customers for 17 days in 2000-2001 with service disruptions resulting in increased air pollution and higher electricity prices for California consumers from the use of oil as an alternate fuel source by electric generating plants.
The lawsuit seeks statutory penalties of not less than $1 million, $2,500 for each of an unspecified number of instances of unfair business practices, and unspecified amounts of actual and punitive damages. It also seeks an injunction to require divestiture by Sempra Energy of non-utility subsidiaries to an extent to be determined by the court.
