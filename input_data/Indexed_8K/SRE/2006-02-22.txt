Fourth-Quarter 2005 Net Income Increases to $355 Million
Commodities Unit Drives Earnings Growth
Company Raises 2006 Earnings-Per-Share Guidance to $3.40 to $3.60
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 22, 2006 - Based on strong results in its commodities and utility businesses, Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported 2005 net income of $920 million, or $3.65 per diluted share, compared with $895 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, in 2004.
Sempra Energy's fourth-quarter 2005 net income was $355 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared with $346 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, in 2004.
In 2005, Sempra Energy incurred $311 million after tax in litigation costs related to the Western U.S. energy crisis of 2000-01, compared with $84 million in 2004. In the fourth quarter 2005, the company took an after-tax charge of $116 million for energy-crisis-related litigation costs compared with $74 million in the prior-year quarter.
 
 
"We are pleased to report record net income in 2005 and a strong fourth quarter, driven by the outstanding operating results in our commodities and power generation businesses, as well as our California utilities," said Donald E. Felsinger, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy. "We continue to execute our strategy, expanding our competitive businesses in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas pipelines and storage, while building upon a solid foundation with our utilities, generation and commodities units."
Yesterday, Sempra Energy's board of directors announced an increase in the dividend on common shares on an annualized basis to $1.20 from $1.16.
Revenues for Sempra Energy in 2005 increased to $11.7 billion from $9.4 billion in 2004, due primarily to higher natural gas costs and increased commodities marketing activity. Fourth-quarter 2005 revenues were $4 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the year-earlier period.
SUBSIDIARY OPERATING RESULTS
Sempra Utilities
Net income for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) rose to $262 million in 2005 from $208 million in the previous year. SDG&E's fourth-quarter 2005 net income was $72 million, up from $68 million in the fourth quarter 2004, due primarily to regulatory approval of demand-side-management incentives. In the fourth quarter 2004, SDG&E benefited from the settlement of its rate case at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
Net income for Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) was $211 million in 2005, compared with $232 million in 2004. Fourth-quarter 2005 net income for SoCalGas was $48 million, compared with $58 million earned in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter 2005, SoCalGas received regulatory approval of demand-side-management incentives. In the previous-year quarter, SoCalGas benefited from the settlement of its rate case at the CPUC.
 
Sempra Commodities
Sempra Commodities had record net income of $460 million in 2005, an increase of 44 percent over 2004 net income of $320 million. Fourth-quarter 2005 net income for Sempra Commodities rose to $244 million from $171 million in the same quarter in 2004, due primarily to increased activity in natural gas, power and oil marketing in both Europe and North America.
"Sempra Commodities has built an enviable track record of growth to become an industry leader, achieving 28 consecutive quarters of profitability," Felsinger said.
Sempra Generation
Sempra Generation's 2005 net income was $164 million, up from $137 million the previous year. Fourth-quarter net income for Sempra Generation increased to $61 million in 2005 from $19 million in 2004, due primarily to improved operating results for the company's Western U.S. power-generating fleet.
Sempra Generation announced plans in December 2005 to sell or refinance all of its Texas-based power-generation assets. Last month, the company entered into an agreement to sell one of its Texas power plants, the 305-megawatt coal-fired Twin Oaks Power facility, for $480 million in cash. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter 2006 and result in an after-tax gain of approximately $215 million.

Net income for Sempra Pipelines & Storage in 2005 was $64 million, compared with $63 million in 2004. Fourth-quarter 2005 net income for Sempra Pipelines & Storage was $16 million, compared with $28 million in the previous year's quarter. In the fourth quarter 2004, Sempra Pipelines & Storage benefited from the favorable resolution of foreign-tax issues.
