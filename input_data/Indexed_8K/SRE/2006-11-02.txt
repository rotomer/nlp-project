Company Reports $332 Million in Income From Continuing Operations, Excluding Asset Sales
Earnings Guidance Raised for 2006
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 2, 2006 - Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported earnings of $653 million, or $2.49 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2006, up from $221 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in the same period last year.  Third-quarter 2006 earnings included income of $110 million from discontinued operations, compared with $5 million in the prior-year period.
Income from continuing operations in the third quarter 2006 was $543 million, or $2.07 per diluted share.  Continuing operations included a $211 million gain from the sale of several Texas power plants.  Excluding the impact of these asset sales, third-quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $332 million, or $1.27 per diluted share.  
Third-quarter 2005 net income benefited from several one-time items totaling $141 million, offset by a $189 million after-tax effect from an increase in litigation reserves.

For the first nine months of 2006, Sempra Energy's earnings were $1.28 billion, or $4.92 per diluted share, compared with $565 million, or $2.26 per diluted share, during the same period in 2005.  Excluding the impact of the sale of the Texas power plants, nine-month income from continuing operations in 2006 was $758 million, or $2.91 per diluted share.
"Our strategy is to grow both our natural gas infrastructure businesses and our California utilities, while divesting non-core assets," said Donald E. Felsinger, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy.  "Execution of this plan has been very successful to date.  Given our strong results through the first nine months of the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for 2006."
Felsinger said the company has raised its 2006 earnings guidance to a range of $3.50 per share to $3.70 per share from continuing operations, excluding gains on asset sales, from the previous range of $3.40 per share to $3.60 per share.
Sempra Energy's revenues in the third quarter 2006 were approximately $2.7 billion, unchanged from the year-ago quarter.
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
Sempra Utilities
Third-quarter net income for Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) rose to $61 million in 2006 from $36 million last year.  In the prior-year's quarter, SoCalGas recorded a $53 million after-tax increase in litigation reserves, partially offset by an $18 million benefit from the resolution of prior-years' tax issues.
San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) had net income of $70 million in the third quarter 2006, compared with $102 million in the same quarter last year.  In the third quarter 2006, SDG&E benefited from a favorable regulatory outcome and contributions from its new Palomar Energy Center.  In the year-ago quarter, SDG&E recorded a $39 million  benefit from the resolution of prior-years' tax issues and a $27 million benefit from an electric-transmission cost settlement, offset by the effect of a $27 million after-tax increase in litigation reserves.

In August 2006, the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state's power grid, endorsed SDG&E's proposal to build Sunrise Powerlink, a major new transmission line.  The project, if approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, will be built and placed into service in 2010.
Sempra Commodities
Sempra Commodities' third-quarter net income was $105 million in 2006, compared with $161 million last year.  In the third quarter 2005, Sempra Commodities had a $16 million benefit from the resolution of prior-years' tax issues and a $38 million after-tax gain related to asset sales, partially offset by the effect of a $14 million after-tax increase in litigation reserves.  During the recent quarter, Sempra Commodities' results in natural gas, power marketing and metals were strong, while margins in its petroleum marketing business were lower.
Sempra Generation
Net income for Sempra Generation in the third quarter 2006 was $265 million, up from $24 million in the third quarter 2005.  In the recent quarter, Sempra Generation benefited from a net gain of $211 million from the sale of the company's 50-percent stake in several Texas power plants, as well as lower project-development and operating costs.  Third-quarter 2005 earnings were affected by $19 million from temporary mark-to-market losses on forward sales. 
Sempra Pipelines & Storage
Third-quarter net income for Sempra Pipelines & Storage was $19 million in 2006, unchanged from the prior-year's quarter.

Once developed, the newly acquired property and caverns would become an extension of Liberty Gas Storage -- a nearby natural gas storage facility the two companies currently are constructing.
Sempra LNG
Sempra LNG reported a loss of $13 million in the third quarter 2006, compared with a loss of $5 million in the same quarter last year.
