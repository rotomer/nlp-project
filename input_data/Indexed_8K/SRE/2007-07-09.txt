Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 9, 2007, Sempra Energy and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS") entered into an agreement to form a partnership, RBS Sempra Commodities LLP, to purchase and operate Sempra Energy's commodity-marketing businesses.
Pursuant to a Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Formation Agreement") filed as an exhibit to this report, RBS Sempra Commodities will be formed as a United Kingdom limited liability partnership in which Sempra Energy and RBS will make initial equity investments of $1.3 billion and $1.355 billion, respectively.  The partnership concurrently will purchase Sempra Energy's commodity-marketing subsidiaries at a price (after deducting certain expenses to be paid by Sempra Energy in terminating pre-existing contractual arrangements) equal to their book valuecomputed on the basis of international financial reporting standards ("IFRS").RBS will provide any additional funding required for the ongoing operating expenses of the partnership's businesses.  
RBS Sempra Commodities will initially be governed by a board of seven directors, three appointed by Sempra Energy and four by RBS.  The consent of Sempra Energy will be required before the partnership may take certain significant actions, including materially changing the scope of the partnership's businesses, issuing credit support outside the ordinary course, incurring certain types of indebtedness and entering into agreements of significant size or duration, all as more fully specified in the Limited Liability Partnership Agreement (the "LLP Agreement") that is filed as an exhibit to this report.
Sempra Energy and RBS intendthat RBS Sempra Commodities will distribute all of its net income on an annual basis, although under the LLP Agreement distributions are within the discretion of the Board of Directors.  Subject to certain limited exceptions, partnership pre-tax income, calculated in accordance with IFRS,will be allocated as follows:
Sempra Energy will receive a preferred 15 percent return on its adjusted equity capital (initially, $1.3 billion);
RBS will receive a preferred 15 percent return on any capital in excess of capital attributable to Sempra Energy that is required by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (the "FSA") to be maintained by RBS in respect of the operations of the partnership;
Sempra Energy will receive 70 percent of the next $500 million in pre-tax income, with RBS receiving the remaining 30 percent; and
Sempra Energy will receive 30 percent, and RBS 70 percent, of any remaining pre-tax income.
Any losses of the partnership would be shared equally between Sempra Energy and RBS.
Sempra Energy will not be required to invest additional capital in RBS Sempra Commodities beyond its initial capital investment of $1.3billion although, in limited cases, earnings allocable to Sempra Energy may be retained by the partnership to replenish capital depleted through losses.  However, Sempra Energy will be permitted to provide additional capital of up to $200 million to the partnership, and RBS will have the right to contribute additional capital on an equal basis, to the extent thatcapital required by the FSA to be maintainedby RBS in respect ofthe partnershipexceeds $2.45 billion.
RBS and Sempra Energy will use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate Sempra Energy's credit support arrangements for the commodity-marketing businesses to be purchased by RBS Sempra Commodities or to replace them with credit support provided by RBS.  To the extent that Sempra Energy's credit support cannot be terminated or replaced, RBS will indemnify Sempra Energy for any claims or losses arising in connection with those arrangements. A copy of the Indemnity Agreement relating to these indemnification obligations is filed as an exhibit to this report.
For a period of four years following the closing of the RBS Sempra Commodities purchase of Sempra Energy's commodity-marketing businesses, each of RBS and Sempra Energy will agree to certain limitations on their ability to compete with the partnership.  RBS will agree not to compete with certain core business activities of the
3
partnership (defined to include trading, processing and tolling of, and derivatives and certain other transactions in, oil and oil byproducts, electricity, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, base metals, coal, liquefied petroleum gas, biofuels, carbon credits and emissions credits) or to acquire an equity interest in any entity whose principal business involves activities that are competitive with the partnership's core business activities. If RBS were to acquire an equity interest in excess of agreed upon thresholds in entities whose activities include, but are not principally comprised of, those that are competitive with the partnership's core business activities, RBS and Sempra Energy would engage in good faith negotiations to combine the activities of such competitor with those of the partnership, and if RBS and Sempra Energy are not able to agree on terms within six months, RBS would be required to offer the partnership an opportunity to act as the counterparty with respect to certain significant commodities hedging, supply and offtake opportunities generated by RBS's other business activities in the areas of project finance and structured finance.   
Sempra Energy will also agree to limitations, mirroring those to which RBS will be subject, on its ability to acquire equity interests in entities competing with the core business activities of RBS Sempra Commodities.  Certain Sempra Energy non-utility businesses will also be required, subject to risk concentration policies, to offer the partnership an opportunity to act as the counterparty to Sempra Energy in certain transactions that are competitive with the core business activities of the partnership.
For a period of four years following the closing, neither RBS nor Sempra Energy will be permitted to sell or assign its interest in the partnership.  Following this four-year period, if Sempra Energy were to desire to sell its interest, it would be required to so notify RBS and, unless RBS notifies Sempra Energy that it is not interested in purchasing such interest, negotiate with RBS to determine a price at which the interest would be sold to RBS.  If Sempra Energy and RBS were unable to agree upon a price at which the interest would be sold to RBS, either party would be permitted to request that the price be submitted for binding arbitration.  If the other party assents to that request, the interest will be sold to RBS at a price determined by arbitration subject to a maximum price of $3.5 billion in the fourth year following the closing and increasing by 2.5% per year to a maximum of $4 billion.  If RBS declines to arbitrate, Sempra Energy may sell its interest to a third party upon terms no more favorable than those at which the interest was offered to RBS.  If the third party purchaser is a bank or broker-dealer, a majority owned or controlled affiliate of a bank or broker-dealer or a hedge fund controlled by such an entity or has a credit rating lower than Sempra Energy's, the third party purchaser must also be reasonably acceptable to RBS.
If RBS were to desire to sell its interest in RBS Sempra Commodities after such four-year period, it would be required to provide Sempra Energy with the opportunity to make the first offer to acquire the interest and would be prohibited from subsequently selling the interest to a third party upon terms less favorable than those offered by Sempra Energy.  The LLP Agreement will also provide Sempra Energy with the right to "tag-along" in connection with any sale of RBS's interest in the partnership to a third party.
In addition, if RBS were to fail to fund RBS Sempra Commodities consistent with its commitments and intentions and did not cure that failure within a specified period following notice from Sempra Energy, Sempra Energy would have the right to purchase RBS's interest in the partnership at book value.
The closing is expected to occur prior to the end of 2007, and either RBS or Sempra Energy may unilaterally terminate the Formation Agreement if the closing does not occur by June 30, 2008.The closing is subject to customary closing conditions and the approval of regulatory authorities including the FSA, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  With certain exceptions, the representations and warranties contained in the Formation Agreement will survive the closing, and subject to certain limitations, Sempra Energy will indemnify RBS for its out-of-pocket damages resulting from breaches of Sempra Energy's representations, warranties and covenants. Sempra Energy will also indemnify the partnershipfor liabilities in respect of certain litigation and taxes relating to the businesses to be purchased by the partnership. RBS, subject to certain limitations, will indemnify Sempra Energy for its out-of-pocket damages resul ting from breaches of RBS's representations, warranties and covenants.
 
Copies of the LLP Agreement, the Formation Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.  The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to each of the LLP Agreement, the Formation Agreement and the Indemnity Agreement.

RBS, within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, shall h ave the right to purchase the Offered Interest on terms and conditions identical in all material respects to, or more favourable to such Sempra Member than, the terms and conditions on which such Sempra Member was willing to Transfer the Offered Interest to such third party.  RBS shall exercise such right by notifying such Sempra Member in writing and taking such further actions as are required to close such Transfer within 180 days of the date on with RBS exercises such right.  If RBS fails to exercise such right within the thirty (30) day period specified above or, following exercise of such right, fails to promptly perform such actions as are required hereunder, such Sempra Member shall have no further obligation to RBS with regard to such Transfer and may Transfer the Offered Interest to such third party in
accordance with clause (v) on terms and conditions identical in all material respects to, or no more favourable to such third party than, the terms and conditions specified in the notice described above.

Subject to the provisions of the next sentences, if RBS agrees to purchase the Offered Interest pursuant to this Clause 16.3.2, the purchase price for such Offered Interest shall not, in any event, exceed $5,000,000,000. The provisions of the foregoing sentence are for the benefit of the RBS Member Group alone and may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Outside Transfer Notice or a notice pursuant to clause (vi), be waived by RBS at its sole discretion (whether entirely or subject to a higher cap determined by RBS). To the extent that, at the time of such waiver, RBS or any of its holding companies remains subject to laws or regulations requiring transactions above a certain size to be approved by RBS's, or such holding company's, as the case may be, shareholders before such transactions are implemented, such waiver shall only be effective to the extent that ei ther: (x) the waiver does not result in such a requirement being triggered or (y) the waiver does trigger such a requirement but the relevant shareholder approval is obtained within sixty (60) days of the waiver (and the receipt of such approval or, in its absence, the expiry of such sixty (60) day period shall be a condition to the completion of such purchase).
(b)
Clause (ix)(a) shall not in any manner restrict such Sempra Member's right to value and negotiate for the sale of the Offered Interest at such purchase price as such Sempra Member, in its sole discretion, may determine.  If as a result of clause (ix)(a), RBS (or its holding company) is required, as a condition to completing a purchase of the Offered
Interest, seek approval from its shareholders, (x) RBS shall, or shall procure that its holding company, if applicable, recommend such transaction to its shareholders and (y) if such shareholder approval is not obtained within the period of time set forth in clause (ix)(a), (A) RBS shall be deemed to have delivered an Indication Notice, on the date that such failure to satisfy the closing condition caused such purchase not to close, stating that RBS does not desire to purchase the Offered Interest, and the 270-day period specified in clause (v) shall be deemed to start (or restart) on such date and (B) all restrictions under this Agreement on any Sempra Member's (or successor's) ability to Transfer any interest in the Partnership shall cease to be applicable.
16.3.3
Any third party who purchases an interest in the Partnership from any Sempra Member (the "") shall be subject to the following restrictions on Transfer of such Successor Member's interest in the Partnership.

(c)
any reference to Clause 16.3.1 shall be deemed to be a reference to Clause 16.3.3(i); and
(d)

first
, each Member shall receive a portion of the purchase price equal to such Member's Adjusted Contribution Amount (or, if the purchase price is less than the aggregate Adjusted Contribution Amounts of the Members, then each Member shall receive a portion of the purchase price proportionate to such Member's Adjusted Contribution Amount as a percentage of the aggregate Adjusted Contribution Amounts of the Members);
second
, any amount of the purchase price remaining shall be divided among the Members in proportion to the average, over the preceding two (2) full Financial Years, of the Sempra Maximum Entitlement or the RBS Maximum Entitlement, as applicable, as a percentage of the average, over such period, of the sum of the Sempra Maximum Entitlement and the RBS Maximum Entitlement;
third

If the Sempra Member Group chooses to exercise such right, it shall provide written notice to the Acquiror and to RBS within twenty (20) days of receipt of the notice informing them of such sale and, upon receipt, all parties shall be deemed to have consented to such Transfers.
16.3.5
If, at any time, one but not both of the Sempra Members (or any Successor Member) determines to Transfer its interest in the Partnership pursuant to Clause 16.3.2 (or 16.3.3), the Sempra Members (or such Successor Member) and RBS shall negotiate in good faith to make such changes to this Agreement, and in particular to the provisions of Clause 16.3.2 (or 16.3.3), as may be necessary or desirable to (i) accommodate such Transfer by a single Sempra Member (or such Successor Member), (ii) provide for, if applicable, the admission of an additional Member that is not an Associated Company of either Sempra Energy (or, if applicable, such Successor Member) or RBS and (iii) equitably allocate any aggregate limitations applicable to the Sempra Member Group (or such Successor Member) to the individual Sempra Members (or any Successor Member).

Waiver; Remedies Cumulative

WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge that certain Financial Assurances continue to be outstanding on and after the Closing Date;

Indemnification Procedures
(a)
If any Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any demand for payment or other obligation (a "") from a third party under any Financial Assurance, the relevant Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnitor notice of such demand for payment or other obligation, stating with reasonable specificity, if available, the amount of the payment or other obligation that it expects to make under the Financial Assurances, and method of computation thereof, and containing a copy of and reference to the provisions of the Financial Assurance in respect of which such payment or other obligation has arisen or to which it relates and any other pertinent facts and circumstances relating to such payment or other obligation,
Third Party Claim
within 5 days, of the receipt by the Indemnified Parties of such notice of any demand for payment or other obligation; that failure to notify or delay in notifying the Indemnitor shall not release their obligations under this Agreement except to the extent such failure or delay actually harms the Indemnitor.
provided
(b)
After receipt by the Indemnitor of the notice set forth in Section 1.02(a), the Indemnitor shall either advise the Indemnified Parties to make payment and provide immediately available funds for such purpose or shall indemnify the Indemnified Parties hereunder against any Losses that may result from non-payment of such payment or other obligation, including Losses arising from the refusal to pay; , that if the Indemnitor provides immediately available funds for such purpose and the Indemnified Parties fail to make the relevant payment, the Indemnitor shall have no obligation in respect of any Losses that may result from non-payment of such payment or obligation, including Losses arising from the refusal to pay.  
provided
(c)
The Indemnified Parties will make payment under such Financial Assurance only if and to the extent instructed to do so by the Indemnitor; it being understood that in no event shall the Indemnitor be liable to indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties under this Agreement for any Losses in respect of a Financial Assurance in excess of the Losses actually suffered by the Indemnified Parties (including any Losses as described under subsection (b) above).
(d)
To the extent the Indemnitor pays in full any Third Party Claim pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of the Indemnified Parties as to any events or circumstances in respect of which the Indemnified Parties may have any right or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other Person.  The Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor in prosecuting any subrogated right or claim.
(e)
The Indemnitor shall have the opportunity to assume all the relevant rights, if any, of the Indemnified Parties under the agreements for which the payment or other obligation has been made as well as assume and control the defense of any claims arising out of such payment or other obligation at its expense and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties.
(f)
Nothing herein shall require the Indemnified Parties to delay payment beyond the date due under the applicable Financial Assurance.
1.03
.  To the extent any reimbursement or payment upon subrogation, or any part thereof, from the SET Companies in respect of any Financial Assurances is, pursuant to any Legal Requirement, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Indemnified Party, whether as a "voidable preference", "fraudulent conveyance", or otherwise, Indemnitor's obligations under this Agreement shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
Reinstatement
1.04
.  Each of the parties hereto intends for this Agreement to be an indemnity agreement.  To the extent, however, that this Agreement is treated as being a guarantee or creating a suretyship obligation, the Indemnitor agrees that:

(b)
the Indemnified Parties shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder;
(c)
in the event that the Indemnitor becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Indemnified Parties so to file shall not affect the Indemnitor's obligations hereunder.  In the event that any payment by the Indemnified Parties in respect of any Financial Assurance is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, the Indemnitor shall remain liable hereunder in respect of such Financial Assurance as if such payment had not been made; and  
(d)
the Indemnitor reserves the right to assert defenses which the Indemnified Parties may have to the making of any payment under Financial Assurance, other than defenses expressly waived hereby.
1.05
.  The Indemnitor agrees that the Indemnified Parties may at any time and from time to time, upon prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall be made in the Indemnitor's sole discretion), extend the time of payment of, exchange or surrender any collateral for, or renew any of the Financial Assurance, and may also, subject to such consent of the Indemnitor, make any agreement for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release of the Financial Assurance, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between Indemnified Parties and the beneficiaries of the Financial Assurance, without in any way impairing or affecting the Indemnitor's obligations hereunder. The Indemnitor shall make payments hereunder without any reduction on account of any counterclaim, set off, or defe nse Indemnitor may have against any Indemnified Party or any other Person.  The Indemnitor unconditionally waives, to the greatest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each of the following rights, remedies and notices: (a) any and all notice of the renewal, extension or accrual of any of the obligations under this Agreement and notice of or proof of reliance by any Indemnified Party upon this Agreement, or acceptance of this Agreement, and the obligations under this Agreement, (b) subject to Section 1.02(c), any requirement that any Indemnified Party exhaust any right or take any action against the SET Companies, the Indemnitor or any other Person or any collateral, (c) any and all rights which Indemnitor may have or which at any time hereafter may be conferred upon it, by statute (including but not limited to any statute of limitations), regulation or otherwise, to terminate or cancel this Agreement except in accordance with its terms, (d) all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or ot herwise to preserve any rights against the Indemnitor hereunder, including, without limitation, any demand, presentment, protest, proof or notice of nonpayment of any amounts payable under or in respect of the Financial Assurances, and notice of any failure on the part of SET Companies to perform and comply with any term or condition of any Financial Assurance except as may be required thereby, (e) any rights in respect of the failure of the Indemnified Parties to assert rights to the
Consents, Waivers and Renewals
