Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Sempra Energy now expects the previously announced sale of its commodities-marketing business to a joint venture of Sempra Energy and The Royal Bank of Scotland to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008 upon receipt of one remaining regulatory approval for the transaction.
Following the closing, Sempra Energy expects to recommence a program to purchase $1 billion of its common shares. The program will be funded from the proceeds received from the joint venture transaction.
Sempra Energy's previously announced $1 billion share purchase program originally scheduled to begin on February 7, 2008 has been suspended pending the closing of the joint venture transaction, and on January 16, 2008 the agreement with Merrill Lynch International providing for that program as a Collared Accelerated Share Acquisition Program was terminated.
