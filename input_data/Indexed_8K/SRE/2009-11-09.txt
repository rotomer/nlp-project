NEWS RELEASE
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 9, 2009  Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported that earnings increased in the third quarter 2009 to $317 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, from $308 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2008.  
Earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $831 million, or $3.37 per diluted share, up nearly 5 percent from $794 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, in the first nine months of last year.  
"Our results through the first nine months of the year benefited from the solid performance of our California utilities and our commodities business, as well as continued progress in the build-out of our natural gas infrastructure projects," said Donald E. Felsinger, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra Energy.  "We remain on track to meet our 2009 financial targets."
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
San Diego Gas & Electric
Third-quarter earnings for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) were $108 million in 2009, compared with $123 million last year.  Third-quarter 2008 results included $33 million in earnings from the retroactive application of SDG&E's rate case, approved in July 2008.
For the first nine months, SDG&E earnings rose to $277 million in 2009 from $258 million last year.  
Southern California Gas Co.
Earnings for Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) in the third quarter 2009 were $74 million, compared with $77 million in the third quarter 2008.  Third-quarter 2008 results included $7 million in earnings from the retroactive application of SoCalGas' rate case, approved in July 2008.
For the nine-month period, SoCalGas' earnings increased to $198 million in 2009 from $190 million in 2008.
RBS Sempra Commodities
Earnings for Sempra Energy's commodity operations  concentrated in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture  were $75 million in the third quarter 2009, compared with a loss of $8 million in last year's third quarter, due primarily to improved performance in natural gas marketing.  Results in last year's third quarter were negatively impacted by losses in power marketing caused by the steep decline in commodity prices during the quarter.
For the nine-month period, earnings from Sempra Energy's commodity operations increased to $274 million in 2009 from $181 million last year.
Last week, as part of its ongoing restructuring plan responding to increased government investment, The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) announced its intention to divest several of its assets, including its 51-percent stake in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture.  RBS has told Sempra Energy that the bank will comply with the joint-venture agreement and execute the sale in an orderly manner to maximize the value of the business.  RBS also said it is committed to maintaining the usual liquidity, credit and funding operations for the joint venture.
 
Sempra Generation
In the third quarter 2009, Sempra Generation's earnings were $43 million, compared with $94 million in the third quarter 2008.  Sempra Generation benefited in last year's third quarter from $28 million of mark-to-market earnings on long-term contracts with RBS Sempra Commodities and other counterparties, as well as $8 million from a solar investment tax credit and more favorable market pricing.
For the first nine months of 2009, Sempra Generation earned $119 million, compared with $162 million in the same period a year ago.
In September, Sempra Generation announced it has become an equal partner with BP Wind Energy in the Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm project in Indiana, scheduled to commence operations in the fourth quarter 2009.  The entire output of the 200-megawatt facility already has been sold under four, 20-year contracts.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage
Third-quarter 2009 earnings for Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased to $54 million from $34 million, due primarily to lower income taxes and increased contributions from the Rockies Express pipeline.
For the nine-month period, earnings for Sempra Pipelines & Storage were $64 million in 2009, compared with $84 million last year.  In the second quarter 2009, Sempra Pipelines & Storage recorded an after-tax charge of $64 million for the write-off of some of its Louisiana natural gas storage assets.
