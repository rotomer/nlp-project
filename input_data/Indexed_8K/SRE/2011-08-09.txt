NEWS RELEASE
Excluding $277 Million Gain on South American Acquisition:
Second-Quarter Earnings per Share Rise 9 Percent
Company Reaffirms 2011 Earnings-per-Share Guidance of $4 to $4.30
Generation Unit Halfway Toward 2016 Target of 1,000 MW in Renewable Power Contracts
SAN DIEGO, Aug. 9, 2011  Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported second-quarter 2011 earnings of $511 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, up from earnings of $222 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, in the second quarter 2010.
This year's second-quarter earnings included a gain of $277 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, reflecting the write-up in the value of the company's original investments in Chile and Peru as a result of the acquisition of a controlling interest in those utilities earlier this year.   
Excluding this gain, Sempra Energy's diluted earnings per share in the second quarter 2011 increased approximately 9 percent to $0.97 over second-quarter 2010 earnings per share of $0.89.
Sempra Energy's earnings through the first six months of 2011 were $769 million, or $3.19 per diluted share, compared with $328 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, in 2010.   First-quarter 2010 earnings included an after-tax charge of $96 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, related to a litigation settlement.
 "Through the first half of the year, we are performing well across the board and are on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance," said Debra L. Reed, chief executive officer of Sempra Energy.  "Our utility and pipeline acquisitions are providing strong contributions to our earnings.  We also are making excellent progress on our major California utility projects and our build-out of contracted renewable energy infrastructure."
As previously announced, Reed was elected chief executive officer of Sempra Energy June 27, succeeding Donald E. Felsinger.  Felsinger will continue to serve as executive chairman.
Sempra Energy today reaffirmed its 2011 earnings-per-share guidance of $4 to $4.30, excluding the $1.15 related to the company's acquisition of controlling interests in the Chile and Peru utilities (earnings-per-share guidance of $5.15 to $5.45, on a GAAP basis).

Southern California Gas Co.
Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) had second-quarter earnings of $59 million in 2011, compared with $69 million in the prior-year's second quarter, due primarily to lower natural gas storage revenues, and higher employee benefit costs and other expenses.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage
In the second quarter 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage earned $337 million, up from $39 million in the prior year's quarter.  Second-quarter 2011 results included a non-cash gain of $277 million from the write-up in the value of the original investments in Sempra Pipelines & Storage's electric utilities in Chile and Peru and $14 million in higher earnings primarily from increased ownership in these companies.  
For the first six months of 2011, Sempra Pipelines & Storage's earnings increased to $391 million from $77 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the gain on the Chile and Peru utility acquisitions and higher earnings from those utilities, as well as from a Mexican pipeline acquired in the second quarter 2010.
Sempra LNG
Sempra LNG's earnings in the second quarter 2011 rose to $18 million from $13 million in last year's second quarter, due primarily to payments by customers for contracted cargoes that were not delivered.
