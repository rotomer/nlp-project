NEWS RELEASE
Quarterly Earnings per Share of $1.22 Reflect Strong Operating Results, Growth Across Businesses
Company Reaffirms 2011 Earnings-per-Share Guidance of $4 to $4.30, Excluding Gain on South American Utility Acquisitions
SAN DIEGO, Nov. 3, 2011  Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) today reported
third-quarter 2011 earnings of $296 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, up from $131 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2010.
Third-quarter 2010 results included an after-tax charge of $139 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, from the write-down of Sempra Energy's investment in the RBS Sempra Commodities joint venture, which was sold last year.
Sempra Energy's earnings for the first nine months of 2011 were $1.1 billion, or $4.40 per diluted share, up from $459 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, in the same period last year.  Excluding a second-quarter 2011 gain of $277 million related to the South American utility acquisitions, Sempra Energy's nine-month earnings in 2011 were $788 million, or $3.26 per diluted share.  
"Based on our excellent results in the third quarter and continued progress on our major projects, we expect to meet our financial and operational objectives for the year," said Debra L. Reed, chief executive officer of Sempra Energy.
In September, Sempra Energy announced several key executive appointments.  Additionally, the company announced that, effective Jan. 1, 2012, its Sempra Generation, Sempra Pipelines & Storage and Sempra LNG subsidiaries will be consolidated into two new operating units:  Sempra International and Sempra U.S. Gas & Power.  
OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
San Diego Gas & Electric
Earnings for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) increased to $113 million in the third quarter 2011 from $106 million in last year's third quarter, due primarily to higher earnings for construction projects in progress, including the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line.   
For the first nine months of 2011, SDG&E's earnings were $273 million, compared with $264 million in the first nine months of 2010.
Southern California Gas Co.
 Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) earnings were $81 million in the third quarter 2011, compared with $78 million in the third quarter 2010.
For the nine-month period, SoCalGas' earnings were $208 million in 2011, compared with $212 million last year.  
Sempra Generation
In the third quarter 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings were $49 million, compared with $59 million in the prior-year's quarter, primarily due to lower earnings from the company's natural gas-fired power plants, partially offset by an income-tax benefit.
For the first nine months of 2011, Sempra Generation's earnings rose to $143 million from $60 million in the first nine months of 2010.   The nine-month results in 2010 included a charge of $86 million related to a litigation settlement.
Sempra Pipelines & Storage
Third-quarter earnings for Sempra Pipelines & Storage increased to $66 million in 2011 from $43 million last year, due primarily to the company's increased ownership in the South American utilities and a foreign-currency gain in Chile.  
For the nine-month period, earnings for Sempra Pipelines & Storage rose to $457 million in 2011 from $120 million in 2010.   The nine-month earnings for 2011 included the second-quarter gain of $277 million related to the South American utility acquisitions.
Sempra LNG
Sempra LNG earned $24 million in the third quarter 2011, up from $5 million in last year's third quarter, due primarily to additional revenues for contracted cargoes that were not delivered.  
In the first nine months of 2011, Sempra LNG earnings rose to $75 million from $50 million in the same period last year.
Earnings Outlook
Sempra Energy today reaffirmed its earnings-per-share guidance for 2011 of $4 to $4.30, excluding the gain related to the South American utility acquisitions in the second quarter 2011.  On a GAAP basis, the company's earnings-per-share guidance for 2011 is $5.14 to $5.44.
