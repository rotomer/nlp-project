Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Amendments to Bylaws
On September 13, 2012, the Board of Directors of Sempra Energy (the "Company") amended the Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") to provide for a Lead Director who will have the authority to call special meetings of the Board of Directors and have such other duties as determined by the board.  In connection with providing for a Lead Director, the expressed duties of the Vice Chairman of the Board (the "Vice Chairman") were eliminated, which duties included presiding at board and shareholder meetings when the Chairman is not present, assisting the Chairman in his or her responsibilities for board and shareholder governance, calling special meetings of shareholders and the board, signing certificates for shares, and inviting each Director Emeritus, if any, to attend board meetings.  While the role of the Vice Chairman is no longer expressly contemplated by the Bylaws, the board may appoint a Vice Chairman at anytime with such duties that are not in contravention of the Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation, or California law.
The Bylaws were also amended to clarify that the Chairman is not required to be an officer of the Company and to provide that all of the officers report to the Chief Executive Officer if the Chairman is not an executive officer of the Company.  Finally, the Bylaws were amended to reduce the list of required officers to the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, make the creation of other officer positions subject to the discretion of the board, and clarify that the Controller need not be the principal accounting officer of the Company.
The foregoing descriptions of the Bylaws are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual Bylaws of Sempra Energy, which are filed as Exhibit 3(ii) of this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

In such case only Shareholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting or to receive such dividend, distribution or an allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after any record date fixed as aforesaid.  The Board may close the books of the Corporation against any transfer of shares during the whole or any part of such period.

Surrender

.  When a transfer of shares on the books is requested and there is a reasonable doubt as to the rights of the persons seeking such transfer, the Corporation, or its transfer agent or transfer clerk, before entering the transfer of the shares on its books or issuing any certificate therefor, may require from such person reasonable proof of his or her rights, and if there remains a reasonable doubt in respect thereto, may refuse a transfer unless such person shall give adequate security or a bond of indemnity executed by a corporate surety, or by two individual sureties, satisfactory to the Corporation as to form, amount and responsibility of sureties.
Right of Transfer
4.
.  The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any shares as the holder in fact thereof and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of the State of California.
Conflicting Claims
5.
.  In the case of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any certificate for shares, another may be issued in its place as follows:  (a) the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate shall file with the transfer agent of the Corporation a duly executed Affidavit or Loss and Indemnity Agreement and Certificate of Coverage, accompanied by a check representing the cost of the bond as outlined in any blanket lost securities and avoid administration bond previously approved by the Directors of the Corporation and executed by a surety company satisfactory to them, which bond shall indemnify the Corporation, its transfer agents and registrars; or (b) the Board may, in its discretion, authorize the issuance of a new certificate to replace a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate on such other terms and conditions as it may determine to be reasonable.
Loss, Theft and Destruction
1.
.

Definitions
2.
.  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the Corporation against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.  The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.
Indemnification for Third Party Actions
3.
.  The Corporation shall indemnify any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the Corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of the Corporation and its Shareholders.  No indemnification shall be made under this Section (a) in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation in the performance of such person's duty to the Corporation and its Shareholders, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending shall determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses and then only to the extent that the court shall determine; (b) of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a pending action without court approval; or (c) of expenses incurred in defending a pending action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval.
Indemnification for Derivative Actions
4.
.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, to the extent that an agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise (including the dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of a proceeding or action without admission of liability) in defense of any proceeding referred to in Sections 2 or 3 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.
Successful Defense
5.
.  Except as provided in Section 4, any indemnification under Section 3 of this Article shall be made by the Corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 3, by (a) a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to such proceeding; (b) if such a quorum of Directors is not obtainable, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; (c) approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of this Corporation represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum) or by the written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares which would be entitled to vote at such meeting and, for such purpose, the shares owned by the person to be indemnified shall not be considered outstanding or entitled to vote; or (d) the court in which such proceeding is or was pending, upon application made by the Corporation, the agent or the attorney or other person rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such application by said agent, attorney or other person is opposed by the Corporation.
Discretionary Indemnification
6.
.  Expenses incurred in defending any proceeding may be advanced by the Corporation prior to the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such amount if it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article.
Advancement of Expenses
7.
. No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article, except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, in any circumstance where it appears that it would be inconsistent with (a) a provision of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, its bylaws, a resolution of the Shareholders or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or (b) any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
Restriction on Indemnification
8.
.  The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of Shareholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  The rights to indemnification under this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the person.  Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such Directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
Non-Exclusive
9.
.  To the extent that any agent of the Corporation is by reason of such position, or a position with another entity at the request of the Corporation, a witness in any action, suit or proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified against all costs and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection therewith.
Expenses as a Witness
10.
.  The Corporation may purchase and maintain directors and officers liability insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer or other named or specified agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against such expense, liability or loss under the provisions of this Article or under the General Corporation Law.
Insurance
11.
.  Each and every paragraph, sentence, term and provision of this Article is separate and distinct so that if any paragraph, sentence, term or provision hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other paragraph, sentence, term or provision hereof.  To the extent required, any paragraph, sentence, term or provision of this Article may be modified by a court of competent jurisdiction to preserve its validity and to provide the claimant with, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article and any agreement between the Corporation and claimant, the broadest possible indemnification permitted under applicable law.  If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless have the power to indemnify each director, officer, employee, or other agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal or external, including a grand jury proceeding and including an action or suit brought by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated or by any other applicable law.
Separability
12.
.  Upon, and in the event of, a determination of the Board to do so, the Corporation is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with any or all of its Directors, officers, employees and other agents providing for indemnification to the fullest extent permissible under California law and the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation.
Agreements
13.
.  In the event this Article is repealed or modified so as to reduce the protection afforded herein, the indemnification provided by this Article shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
Retroactive Appeal
All obligations of the Corporation, including promissory notes, checks, drafts, bills of exchange, and contracts of every kind, and evidences of indebtedness issued in the name of, or payable to, or executed on behalf of the Corporation, shall be signed or endorsed by such officer or officers, or agent or agents, of the Corporation and in such manner as, from time to time, shall be determined by the Board.
The corporate seal shall set forth the name of the Corporation, state, and date of incorporation.
These bylaws may be amended or repealed as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation.
A current copy of these bylaws shall be mailed or otherwise furnished to any Shareholder of record within five days after receipt of a request therefore.
