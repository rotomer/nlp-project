Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
The Registrant is furnishing the information required by Item 12 of Form 8-K, "Results of Operation and Financial Condition," under this Item 9.
 
On July 10, 2003, the Registrant will hold an investor call and webcast to disclose financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003.

All information in the Supplemental Information is presented as of the News Release date and the Registrant does not assume any obligation to correct or update said information in the future.
 
The News Release presents noninterest income excluding net securities gains and revenue excluding net securities gains. The Registrant believes that noninterest income excluding net securities gains (fee income excluding net securities gains) is more indicative of Registrant performance because it isolates those fee types that are customer relationship and customer transaction driven. The Registrant believes that revenue excluding net securities gains is more indicative of Registrant performance because it isolates those fee types and spread-related revenue types that are customer relationship and customer transaction driven.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures, however, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the Undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

For Immediate Release
July 10, 2003
 
 
ATLANTASunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the second quarter of 2003 of $330.4 million, down 4% from the second quarter of 2002. Net income per diluted share was $1.17, down 3% from the $1.20 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of 2002, but consistent with the $1.17 earned in the first quarter of 2003.
 
"There were no surprises in this quarter's results. This is another quarter of solid performance that also signals our steadily increasing capacity to generate revenue and earnings growth that more fully reflects the strength of our franchise and the validity of our strategies, regardless of economic conditions," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust chairman, president and chief executive officer. Mr. Humann noted in particular that strong fee income growth, attributable in part to excellent performance by the Company's investment management and debt capital markets businesses, more than offset the impact of historically low interest rates.
 
For the second quarter of 2003, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was 1.11%, and return on average total equity (ROE) was 14.95%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.13% and return on average realized equity was 17.87%. The Company believes ROA and ROE excluding net unrealized gains from the Company's securities portfolio is the more indicative performance measure in this area due to SunTrust's ownership of 48 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.
 
 
For the first six months of 2003, net income was $658.2 million, up 1% from the same period in 2002. Net income per diluted share was $2.34, up 4% from the first six months of 2002. ROA was 1.12%, and ROE was 15.04%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.14% and return on average realized equity was 18.01%.
 
SunTrust believes operating earnings of the Company, which exclude certain, merger-related charges, is also an appropriate indicator of basic business performance. Operating income for the first six months was $658.2 million, down 4% from the $688.4 million earned in the comparable 2002 period. Net income for the first six months of 2002 was reduced by $39.8 million, or $0.14 per share, in after-tax merger charges attributed to the acquisition of the Florida franchise of Huntington Bancshares.
 
Fully taxable net interest income was $810.4 million in the second quarter, down 2% from the second quarter of 2002. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.05%, down 16 basis points from the first quarter of 2003.
 
Average loans for the second quarter were $74.3 billion, up 5% from the second quarter of 2002, and average earning assets were $106.6 billion, up 13% from the second quarter of 2002.
 
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter were $69.1 billion, up 6% from the second quarter of 2002. SunTrust said the strong deposit growth reflected the success of targeted sales initiatives undertaken during the quarter.
 
The positive impact of SunTrust's sales focus was also reflected in noninterest income, excluding net securities gains, of $565.6 million in the quarter, up 4% from the second quarter of 2002. Total noninterest income including net securities gains was $596.8 million for the quarter, down 1% from the second quarter of 2002.
 
Reflecting SunTrust's emphasis on maintaining balance in its revenue generation capacity under differing economic scenarios, noninterest income excluding net securities gains represented 41% of total revenue for the second quarter of 2003.
 
 
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter was $837.7 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2002. Excluding incremental incentive compensation costs related to higher business volumes in the second quarter of 2003, expenses were essentially flat from first quarter 2003 levels.
 
Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $82.2 million or 0.44% of average loans, flat from 0.44% of average loans in the first quarter of 2003. The Company believes this is generally indicative of overall improving credit quality conditions. The provision for loan losses was $82.7 million for the second quarter.
 
Nonperforming assets were $515.4 million at quarter end or 0.68% of loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets, down from $548.4 million as of March 31, 2003. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2003 included $483.1 million in nonperforming loans, $20.9 million in other real estate owned and $11.4 million in other repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2003 was $940.9 million and represented 1.25% of period-end loans and 194.8% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust's net charge-off and nonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the most recently published industry averages.
 
At June 30, 2003, SunTrust had total assets of $120.9 billion. Equity capital of $9.2 billion represented 7.59% of total assets. Book value per share was $32.62, up 4% from June 30, 2002.
 
On June 2, SunTrust announced the completion of its acquisition of Hilton Head Island, S.C.- based Lighthouse Financial Services, Inc. With $637 million in assets, $567 million in loans, and $421 million in deposits, Lighthouse operates primarily through five branches and is the largest mortgage lender on Hilton Head Island.
