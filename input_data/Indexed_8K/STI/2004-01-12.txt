For Immediate Release

ATLANTASunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 of $342.5 million, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2002 and up 3% from the third quarter of 2003. Net income per diluted share was $1.21, up 1% from the $1.20 per diluted share earned in the fourth quarter of 2002 and up 10% annualized from this year's third quarter.
 
"For much of 2003 we have been saying that SunTrust, although doing relatively well, was poised for an acceleration in performance as the impact of a slow economy and low interest rates recedes. Now it is beginning to happen," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "With strong fourth quarter results, we are winding up 2003 on a much more positive note than when the year began. But that's not all. Key revenue trends evident in the year's final quarter, notably a resurgence of net interest income growth coupled with continued solid fee income growth, indicate that SunTrust is now on track to deliver the consistently strong performance for which we historically have been known."
 
Mr. Humann cited as "particularly encouraging" the following fourth quarter revenue trends:

For the quarter, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was 1.09%, and return on average total equity (ROE) was 14.40%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.11% and return on average realized equity was 17.13%. The Company believes ROA and ROE excluding net unrealized gains of the Company's securities portfolio are more relevant performance measures due to SunTrust's ownership of 48 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.
 
For the full year 2003, the Company reported net income of $1,332.3 million, up slightly over the $1,331.8 million earned in 2002. Net income per diluted share was $4.73, up 2% from the full year 2002. ROA was 1.09% and ROE was 14.67%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.11% and return on average realized equity was 17.54%.
 
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $877.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2002 and up 16% annualized from the third quarter of 2003. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.09%, up 11 basis points from the third quarter of 2003. SunTrust said the improvement in net interest margin illustrates the Company's reduced vulnerability to a low interest rate environment compared with earlier 2003 quarters. For the full year 2003, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3,365.3 million, up 3% compared to 2002.
 
Average loans for the fourth quarter were $79.4 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2002, and average earning assets were $112.7 billion, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2002. SunTrust noted that excluding the impact of compliance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, which required the consolidation of Three Pillars Funding Corp (Three Pillars), a multi-seller commercial paper conduit, average loans in the fourth quarter were up 6% and average earning assets were up 8% from the fourth quarter of 2002. Average consumer and commercial deposits for the fourth quarter was $70.3 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2002.

Noninterest income excluding net securities gains was $564.6 million in the quarter, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2002. Total noninterest income including net securities gains was $584.1 million for the quarter, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2002. Noninterest income excluding net securities gains represented 39% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003. For the full year 2003, noninterest income excluding net securities gains was $2,179.1 million, up 6% from 2002. For the full year 2003, noninterest income including net securities gains was $2,303.0 million, up 2% from 2002.
 
Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter was $884.8 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2002. For the full year of 2003, total noninterest expense was $3,400.6 million, up 6% from the full year of 2002. Noninterest expense excluding the impacts of Lighthouse Financial and the consolidation of certain affordable housing partnerships in the fourth quarter was up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter were $69.8 million or 0.35% of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $70.3 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2003, net charge-offs were 0.41% of average loans compared to 0.59%of average loans for the full year of 2002. The provision for loan losses was $313.6 million, down 33% from the full year of 2002.
 
Nonperforming assets were $378.1 million at December 31, 2003 or 0.47% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets, down $85.7 million or 18% from the third quarter end. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2003 included $351.4 million in nonperforming loans, $16.5 million in other real estate owned and $10.3 million in other repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2003 was $941.9 million and represented 1.17% of loans and 268.1% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust's net charge-off and nonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the most recently published industry averages.
