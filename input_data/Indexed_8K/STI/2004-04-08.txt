For Immediate Release

ATLANTA - SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the first quarter of 2004 of $358.5 million, up 9% from the first quarter of 2003. Net income per diluted share was $1.26, up 8% from the $1.17 per diluted share earned in the first quarter of 2003.
 
"The first quarter of 2004 was another good one for SunTrust and a positive start to the year," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The pattern of positive performance trends that has been steadily picking up steam since the middle of last year is not only continuing, but having an increasingly visible impact on the bottom line."
 
Mr. Humann cited in particular strong revenue generation, excellent fee income growth, continued net interest margin expansion and effective expense discipline. On the other hand, Mr. Humann noted that "demand for bank loans by large corporate clients remains elusive." Mr. Humann added that SunTrust's first quarter results are supportive of the Company's stated goal of delivering strong, sustainable earnings growth over a multi-year time frame, under different economic scenarios.
 
For the quarter, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was 1.16%, and return on average total equity (ROE) was 14.65%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.19% and return on average realized equity was 17.59% for the quarter. The Company believes ROA and ROE excluding net unrealized gains from the Company's securities portfolio is the more indicative performance measure in this area due to SunTrust's ownership of 48 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.
 
 
Fully taxable net interest income was $863.9 million in the first quarter, up 4% from the first quarter of 2003. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.13%, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2003. As expected, the Company was able to restructure and deconsolidate its multi-seller commercial paper conduit, Three Pillars Funding on March 1, 2004. Excluding the impact of Three Pillars Funding, the net interest margin was up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
Average loans for the first quarter were $79.9 billion, up 9% from the first quarter of 2003, and average earning assets were $111.0 billion, up 6% from the first quarter of 2003. Not including the impact of Three Pillars, average loans in the first quarter were up 7% and average earnings assets were up 4% from the first quarter of 2003.
 
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter were $70.4 billion, up 4% from the first quarter of 2003. As one example of SunTrust's institutional emphasis on customer sales, the Company noted particularly strong continued growth in both DDA deposits and NOW deposit categories, up 17% and 9% respectively from the first quarter of 2003.
 
The positive impact of SunTrust's sales focus was also reflected in noninterest income, excluding net securities gains, of $590.2 million in the quarter, up 17% from the first quarter of 2003. Total noninterest income including net securities gains was $595.1 million for the quarter, up 9% from the first quarter of 2003.
 
Total noninterest income and noninterest income excluding net securities gains both represented 41% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2004.
 
Total noninterest expense in the first quarter was $889.7 million, up 9% from the first quarter of 2003 and essentially flat from the fourth quarter of 2003. Personnel-related expenses, SunTrust's largest operating expense component, while up 7% from a year ago, were down 2% from the prior quarter.
 
Net charge-offs in the first quarter were $58.8 million or 0.30% of average loans, down from $79.8 million, or 0.44% of average loans in the first quarter of 2003. The provision for loan losses was $59.4 million for the first quarter of 2004.
 
 
Nonperforming assets were $331.9 million at quarter end or 0.42% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets, down 12% from $378.1 million as of December 31, 2003. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2004 included $302.6 million in nonperforming loans, $18.4 million in other real estate owned and $11.0 million in other repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2004 was $942.5 million and represented 1.19% of period-end loans and 311.5% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust's net charge-off and nonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the most recently published industry averages.
 
At March 31, 2004, SunTrust had total assets of $125.2 billion. Equity capital of $10.1 billion represented 8.1% of total assets. Book value per share was $35.74, up 15% from March 31, 2003.
