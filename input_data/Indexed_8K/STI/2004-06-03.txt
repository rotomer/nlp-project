This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust") and National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), including future financial and operating results, SunTrust's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of SunTrust's and NCF's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward- looking statements.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule; the failure of SunTrust and NCF stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; increased competition and its effects on pricing, spending, third- party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the U.S. and internationally.  Additional factors that could cause SunTrust's and NCF's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the 2003 Annual Reports on Form 10-K of SunTrust and NCF, and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of SunTrust and NCF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  The forward-looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of the filing, and neither SunTrust nor NCF assumes any obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
This presentation could include some non-GAAP measures to describe SunTrust's performance.  The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in SunTrust's earnings press release, on SunTrust's website in the press release section of the Investor Relations pages and in the appendix of this presentation.
 
Stockholders are urged to read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transaction when it becomes available because it will contain important information.  Stockholders will be able to obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as other filings containing information about SunTrust and NCF, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus can also be obtained, without charge, by directing a request to SunTrust Banks, Inc., 303 Peachtree St., N.E., Atlanta, Georgia  30308, Attention:  Investor Relations; or National Commerce Financial Corporation, One Commerce Square, Memphis, Tennessee  38159, Attention:  Investor Relations.
The respective directors and executive officers of SunTrust and NCF and other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed merger.  Information regarding SunTrust's directors and executive officers is available in the proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by SunTrust on March 2, 2004, and information regarding NCF's directors and executive officers is available in the proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by NCF on March 17, 2004.
