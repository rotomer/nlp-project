For Immediate Release

ATLANTA - SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the second quarter of 2004 of $364.8 million, up 10% from the $330.4 million earned in second quarter of 2003. Net income per diluted share was $1.29, up 10% from the $1.17 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of 2003.
 
"SunTrust's capacity to translate the attractive demographics and high-growth profile of our markets into strong, sustainable and well-balanced earnings growth was amply demonstrated in the second quarter," noted L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Healthy revenue growth, reflecting a good balance of net interest income and fee income, coupled with excellent credit quality, produced strong bottom line results that confirm the validity of our distinctive, customer-focused business strategy."
 
Mr. Humann noted that improved performance by each of SunTrust's key business lines  retail banking, commercial banking, corporate and investment banking, mortgage banking and wealth management  contributed to the quarter's results. Mr. Humann also said that integration planning is "well underway, on track and on schedule" for scheduled closing in the fourth quarter of the Company's previously announced merger with Memphis-based National Commerce Financial Corporation.
 
For the second quarter of 2004, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was 1.15%, and return on average total equity (ROE) was 14.39%. Return on average assets less net
unrealized gains on securities was 1.20% and return on average realized equity was 17.77%. The Company believes ROA and ROE excluding net unrealized gains from the Company's securities portfolio is the more indicative performance measure in this area due to SunTrust's ownership of 48 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.
 
For the first six months of 2004, net income was $723.3 million, up 10% from the same period in 2003. Net income per diluted share was $2.55, up 9% from the first six months of 2003. ROA was 1.16%, and ROE was 14.52%. Return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities was 1.19% and return on average realized equity was 17.61%.
 
Fully taxable net interest income was $885.1 million in the second quarter, up 9% from the second quarter of 2003. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.13%, comparable to the first quarter of 2004, up from 3.05% a year ago and in line with SunTrust's expectations.
 
Average loans for the second quarter were $80.9 billion, up 9% from the second quarter of 2003, and average earning assets were $113.7 billion, up 7% from the second quarter of 2003. SunTrust noted that both consumer and overall commercial loans displayed growth momentum in the second quarter despite a continued lack of demand for bank loans by large corporate borrowers.
 
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter were $73.2 billion, up 6% from the second quarter of 2003. Average low cost consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter were $40.4 billion, up 14% from the second quarter of 2003.
 
Total noninterest income was $622.7 million for the quarter, up 4% from the second quarter of 2003. Noninterest income, excluding net securities gains, of $631.7 million in the quarter, was up 12% from the second quarter of 2003.
 
Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $37.6 million or 0.19% of average loans, down from 0.30% of average loans in the first quarter of 2004. SunTrust noted that the second
quarter charge off level, while consistent with the Company's generally improving credit quality picture, was nonetheless "unusually low." The provision for loan losses was $38.8 million for the second quarter. In addition, the Company added $9.4 million to reserves for unfunded loan commitments during the quarter. This charge is reflected in "other noninterest expense."
 
Nonperforming assets were $324.4 million at quarter end or 0.39% of loans, other real estate owned and repossessed assets, down from $331.9 million as of March 31, 2004. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2004 included $301.1 million in nonperforming loans, $14.2 million in other real estate owned and $9.1 million in other repossessed assets. The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2004 was $943.7 million and represented 1.14% of period-end loans and 313.4% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust's nonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the most recently published industry averages.
 
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter was $928.4 million, up 11% from the second quarter of 2003. Excluding incremental incentive compensation costs related to higher business volumes and the expense to reserve for unfunded loan commitments in the second quarter of 2004, expenses for the quarter were held to first quarter levels.
 
At June 30, 2004, SunTrust had total assets of $128.1 billion. Equity capital of $10.0 billion represented 7.8% of total assets. Book value per share was $35.49, up 9% from June 30, 2003.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
 
The foregoing numbers reflect primarily adjustments to remove the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized gains on the securities portfolio is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security.
See Appendix A for a reconcilement of these non-GAAP performance measures.
