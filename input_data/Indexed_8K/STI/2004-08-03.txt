SUNTRUST BANKS, INC.
SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA
Set forth below are highlights from SunTrust's consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2003 and SunTrust's unaudited consolidated financial data as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2004. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim period. SunTrust prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as it prepared its audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of SunTrust, this information reflects all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data for those dates. This information should be read together with SunTrust's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in SunTrust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and SunTrust's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which are incorporated by reference in this Current Report and from which this information is derived.
NATIONAL COMMERCE FINANCIAL CORPORATION
SELECTED CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA
Set forth below are highlights from NCF's consolidated financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2003 and NCF's unaudited consolidated financial data as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2003 and 2004. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2004 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the full year or any other interim period. The unaudited information was prepared on the same basis as NCF's audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of NCF, this information reflects all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this data for those dates. This information should be read together with NCF's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in NCF's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, and NCF's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which are incorporated by reference in this Current Report and from which this information is derived.
SELECTED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA
The following table shows information about SunTrust's financial condition and results of operations, including per share data and financial ratios, after giving effect to the Merger (collectively, "pro forma financial information"). The table sets forth the information as if the Merger had become effective on March 31, 2004 (using currently available fair value information), with respect to financial condition data, and January 1, 2003, with respect to results of operations data. This pro forma financial information assumes that the Merger is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and represents a current estimate based on available information of the combined company's results of operations. The pro forma financial information includes adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of NCF at their estimated fair values and is subject to further adjustment as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The pro forma financial statements do not currently include any amount related to the estimated $50.9 million after-tax ($82.1 million pre-tax) Merger related costs that will be incurred to combine the operations of SunTrust and NCF. The estimated Merger related costs will result from actions taken with respect to both SunTrust and NCF operations, facilities and associates. The charges will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integration actions. This table should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the historical financial statements, including the notes thereto, of SunTrust and NCF incorporated by reference in this Current Report and the more detailed pro forma financial information, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Current Report.
The pro forma financial information, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the impact of possible revenue enhancements, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors that may result as a consequence of the Merger and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had the companies been combined during these periods.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and explanatory notes present how the combined financial statements of SunTrust and NCF may have appeared had the businesses actually been combined as of March 31, 2004 (with respect to the balance sheet information using currently available fair value information) or as of January 1, 2003 (with respect to income statement information). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information shows the impact of the Merger on the companies' respective historical financial positions and results of operations under the purchase method of accounting with the Registrant treated as the acquirer. Under this method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of NCF will be recorded by the Registrant at their estimated fair values as of the date the Merger is completed. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information combines the historical financial information of SunTrust and NCF as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2003. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2004 assumes the merger was completed on that date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income give effect to the Merger as if the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2003.
The Merger Agreement was announced on May 9, 2004 and provides for SunTrust to issue approximately 75.4 million shares of common stock and $1.8 billion in cash consideration to NCF common shareholders. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been derived from and should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes of SunTrust, which are incorporated in this Current Report by reference.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined and had the impact of possible revenue enhancements, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors, been considered. In addition, as explained in more detail in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the allocation of the purchase price reflected in the pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase price allocation that will be recorded upon completion of the Merger.
SunTrust/NCF Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet (Unaudited)
The following preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical balance sheets of SunTrust and NCF assuming the Merger had been completed on March 31, 2004 on a purchase accounting basis.
SunTrust/NCF Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement (Unaudited)

SunTrust/NCF Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement (Unaudited)
The following preliminary unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement combines the historical income statements of SunTrust and NCF assuming the companies had been combined on January 1, 2003 on a purchase accounting basis.
Note 1  Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information related to the merger is included for the year ended December 31, 2003 and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2004. The pro forma adjustments included herein reflect the issuance of approximately 75.4 million shares of SunTrust common stock and $1.8 billion in cash consideration to NCF common shareholders. The estimated purchase price of $6.9 billion, which includes the value of outstanding stock options, is based on a per share price for SunTrust common stock of $65.24, which was the average of the closing prices of SunTrust common stock for the period commencing two trading days before, and ending two trading days after, May 9, 2004, the date of the Merger announcement. The actual number of shares of SunTrust common stock issued may differ depending on the average of the closing stock prices for SunTrust common stock during the five trading days immediately before the merger and the number of NCF stock options exercised prior to completion of the Merger. The total purchase price may differ depending on the closing price of SunTrust common stock on the day before the completion of the Merger.
The Merger will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting; accordingly, SunTrust's cost to acquire NCF will be allocated to the assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other commitments) of NCF at their respective fair values on the date the Merger is completed.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information includes estimated adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of NCF at their respective fair values and represents SunTrust's estimates based on available information. The pro forma adjustments included herein may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Some revisions could be significant, especially fair value adjustments based on interest rate assumptions. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the Merger is completed and after completion of a final analysis to determine the fair values of NCF's tangible, and identifiable intangible, assets and liabilities as of the completion date. Accordingly, the final purchase accounting adjustments and integration charges may be materially different from the pro forma adjustments presented in this document. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the net assets, commitments, executory contracts and other items of NCF as compared to the information shown in this Current Report may change the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill and other assets and liabilities and may impact the statement of income due to adjustments in yield and/or amortization of the adjusted assets or liabilities.
The pro forma financial statements do not currently include any amount related to the estimated $50.9 million after-tax ($82.1 million pre-tax) Merger related charges that will be incurred to combine the operations of SunTrust and NCF. The estimated Merger related charges will result from action taken with respect to both SunTrust and NCF operations, facilities and associates. The charges will be recorded based on the nature and timing of these integration actions. These charges are also subject to change as additional information becomes known. See Note 3 below for a further discussion of these charges.
Certain amounts in the historical consolidated financial statements of NCF have been reclassified to conform with SunTrust's historical financial information presentation. Discontinued operations separately reported in NCF's historical consolidated statements of income have been excluded. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information presented in this Current Report does not necessarily indicate the results of operations or the combined financial position that would have resulted had the Merger been completed at the beginning of the applicable period presented, nor is it indicative of the results of operations in future periods or the future financial position of the combined company.
Note 2  Pro Forma Adjustments
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for the merger includes the pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2004 assuming the Merger was completed on March 31, 2004 (using currently available fair value information). The pro forma income statements for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2003 were prepared assuming the merger was completed on January 1, 2003.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information reflects the issuance of approximately 75.4 million shares of SunTrust common stock with an aggregate value of approximately $4.9
billion. The actual number of shares of SunTrust common stock issued may differ depending on the average of the closing stock prices for SunTrust common stock during the five trading days immediately before the Merger and the number of NCF stock options exercised prior to completion of the Merger. The total purchase price may differ depending on the closing price of SunTrust common stock on the day before the completion of the Merger. Also reflected in the pro forma condensed combined financial information is a $1.8 billion cash payment to NCF common shareholders. The pro forma financial statements do not include the effects (which are not known at this time) of the change in control provisions of NCF's 49% ownership of First Market Bank, FSB. The pro forma balance sheet includes this investment at book value.
The allocation of the purchase price follows:
SunTrust/NCF Purchase Accounting Adjustments
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information are as follows:
Note 3  Merger Related Charges
Merger related costs, which are not considered liabilities assumed in connection with the Merger, are estimated at $50.9 million, net of taxes. A summary of these costs, based on SunTrust's preliminary estimates, is as follows:
Merger related compensation and severance costs include employee severance, compensation arrangements and related employee benefit expenses. Facilities and system costs include costs associated with the closure of certain retail branch offices and the conversion of other offices to be consistent with SunTrust standards. Also reflected are certain technology conversion costs. Refinements to the foregoing estimates may occur subsequent to the completion of the Merger. Merger related costs incurred by NCF are being expensed as incurred. All other costs incurred by SunTrust will be capitalized or expensed as incurred based on the nature of the costs and SunTrust's accounting policies for these costs.
SunTrust's board of directors and management believe the Merger will close in the fourth quarter of 2004. SunTrust's preliminary integration plans, which are not complete as of the date hereof and are necessarily evolving, include (1) an assessment of the various integration risks (such as capacity assessment and systems conversion) and the development of risk mitigation plans, as appropriate, (2) finalization and confirmation of specified financial assumptions underlying the Merger, (3) identification of product and service gaps and the development of an action plan, (4) planning for implementation of the merger and (5) definition of the target environment. System requirements are scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 2004, with phased system conversions beginning in November 2004. The assessment of the majority of the computer systems, personnel, premises and service contracts is scheduled to be completed in August 2004, upon which SunTrust intends to finalize the restructuring and integration plans. SunTrust can make no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the time frame discussed above, or at all, or that events and uncertainties may cause the achievement of the integration goals not to be met.
