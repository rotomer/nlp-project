ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS     On August 24, 2004, National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF")announced that it had agreed in principle to settle a purported shareholderclass action lawsuit pending against NCF challenging the previously announcedproposed merger between NCF and SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust" or "theRegistrant").      In the settlement, SunTrust will agree to waive its right to receive anyportion of the termination fee payable under the merger agreement in excess of$204,000,000.      Under the terms of the settlement, all claims relating to the mergeragreement, the proposed merger and disclosures related thereto will be dismissedand released on behalf of the settlement class. The settlement is subject toapproval by the court in which the consolidated actions are pending. Uponapproval of the proposed settlement by the court, plaintiff's attorneys areexpected to apply for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses.      Information concerning the proposed merger is set forth or incorporated byreference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposedtransaction, which was first mailed to shareholders of SunTrust and NCF on orabout August 6, 2004.      Such information is supplemented by the additional information filed inthis Current Report on Form 8-K, including specifically the following:      -  On April 27, 2004, SunTrust indicated its interest in pursuing a merger         with NCF for merger consideration consisting of .369 shares of SunTrust         common stock plus $8.50 cash for each share of NCF common stock. On May         7, 2004, SunTrust formally offered to effect a merger with NCF for         merger consideration consisting of 0.3683 shares of SunTrust common         stock plus $8.5557 cash in exchange for each share of NCF common stock.         In addition, after discussions with NCF representatives during the day         of May 7, SunTrust offered to permit NCF to increase its dividend         payable on October 1, 2004 to the same rate that would be payable to         NCF shareholders receiving 100% stock in the merger. SunTrust also         insisted on a termination fee equal to $280 million and offered three         seats on the SunTrust board of directors to then-current members of the         NCF board of directors.      -  Other nonpublic information that NCF provided to SunTrust in the course         of due diligence included the following:         o    information regarding NCF's strategic relationships with certain              retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.;         o    historical loan portfolio information, including lending policies,              problem credits, credit concentrations, loan mixes;         o    analyses of historical deposit mix, historical deposit growth and              types of products offered;         o    business plans for various NCF business units;         o    employee lists, benefit schedules and other information relating              to labor costs;         o    analyses of securities portfolio and interest rate sensitivity;         o    reports from regulators; and         o    litigation files.      -  In performing the discounted cash flow analysis described in the joint         proxy statement/prospectus on pages 59-60, UBS and JPMorgan utilized         assumptions based on the estimates of Institutional Brokerage Estimate         System (I/B/E/S). UBS and
JPMorgan determined the discount rates used in its discounted cash flow         analysis by estimating a range of both NCF's and SunTrust's weighted         average cost of capital. UBS and JPMorgan used the I/B/E/S mean EPS         estimates for 2004 and 2005 and the I/B/E/S mean long-term growth rate         to determine NCF's estimated EPS in 2006-2010. UBS and JPMorgan applied         forward price-to-earnings multiples to NCF's estimated EPS in 2010 to         determine a terminal value. The discount rate was applied to the cash         flows for 2004-2010 to arrive at a price per share.      -  Late in the afternoon of May 7, 2004, after a lengthy discussion, the         NCF board of directors instructed Messrs. Reed, Garrott and McDonald to         inform both SunTrust and Fifth Third that their proposals were         approximately equal in value and that both were being offered the         opportunity to submit a final proposal. SunTrust and Fifth Third were         informed that the board of directors would accept one of the proposals.         In response to this information, both institutions increased the value         of their merger proposals.      -  The only communication regarding NCF director appointments to the         SunTrust board of directors that the negotiating committee had with         SunTrust, which occurred prior to the merger agreement being executed,         was to clarify that all current NCF directors except William R. Reed,         Jr. and three other NCF directors scheduled to retire would be         acceptable to the SunTrust board of directors for nomination and         election to serve on the SunTrust board of directors. At the time the         NCF board of directors voted unanimously to approve the merger         agreement with SunTrust, except as set forth in the preceding sentence,         there had been no agreement reached with respect to the individuals who         would be proposed for election to the SunTrust board of directors         pursuant to the merger agreement. The NCF board of directors instead         instructed the nominating and corporate governance committee of the NCF         board of directors, consisting entirely of independent directors, to         develop a process by which persons would be chosen. Several days after         the merger agreement had been executed and the merger announced, the         nominating and corporate governance committee announced its process for         selecting the slate of nominees to be proposed for election to the         SunTrust board of directors. Mr. Reed, who would be an executive         officer of SunTrust following the merger, and each of the three NCF         directors who would reach SunTrust's mandatory retirement age for         directors by the time of SunTrust's next annual meeting were deemed not         qualified for nomination. In addition, three other directors advised         the nominating and corporate governance committee that they were not         interested in being nominated. The remaining nine directors were         eligible for nomination. The nominating and corporate governance         committee separated the remaining directors into three groups divided         by geography and instructed the directors to vote for one of two         eligible persons in the North Carolina region, one of three eligible         persons in the South Carolina region and two of four eligible persons         in the Tennessee region. All directors cast votes in this manner. The         four persons selected for nomination to serve on the SunTrust board of         directors after consummation of the merger, namely Messrs. Garrott,         Farnsworth, Wynn and Garrett, were chosen by a plurality of votes cast         in the manner described above.
