September 2004
This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust") and National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), including future financial and operating results, SunTrust's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of SunTrust's and NCF's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule; the failure of SunTrust and NCF stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; increased competition and its effects on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the U.S. and internationally.  Additional factors that could cause SunTrust's and NCF's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the 2003 Annual Reports on Form 10-K of SunTrust and NCF, and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of SunTrust and NCF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).   The forward-looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of the filing, and neither SunTrust nor NCF assumes any obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
This presentation could include some non-GAAP measures to describe SunTrust's performance.  The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in SunTrust's earnings press release, on SunTrust's website in the press release section of the Investor Relations pages and in the appendix of this presentation.
 
The information provided herein, including related questions and answers,  may contain estimates of future operating results for SunTrust.

SunTrust presents a return on average realized shareholders' equity, as well as a return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains. These two ratios reflect primarily adjustments to remove the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. SunTrust believes that the return on assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it fully reflects the return on assets that are related to the Company's core businesses, which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security. See the reconciliations slides in the appendix.
