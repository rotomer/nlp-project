Based on preliminary election results and the average closing price of SunTrust common stock of $67.90 for the five-day period ending on Friday, September 17, 2004, and applying the proration provisions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger consideration to be received would be as follows: o stockholders making an election to receive cash would receive approximately $33.84 in cash (the "cash consideration") per NCF share; o stockholders making an election to receive stock would receive 0.4983 shares of SunTrust common stock (the "stock consideration") per NCF share; and o non-electing stockholders would receive the cash consideration with respect to approximately 90% of the NCF shares they own and the stock consideration with respect to their remaining NCF shares.
