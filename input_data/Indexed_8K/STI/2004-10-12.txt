Exhibit 99.1
[SunTrust Banks, Inc. Letterhead]
SunTrust Expects to Restate First and Second Quarter 2004 Earnings; Third Quarter Earnings Release Postponed Pending Review
ATLANTA, Oct. 11  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) announced today that, as a result of revisions to previously reported quarterly allowances for loan losses, reported pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2004 is expected to be increased by $24.8 million, or $0.07 per share after tax. Pre-tax income for the second quarter of 2004 is expected to be increased by $6.8 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. As a result, SunTrust's reported pre-tax income for the first six months of 2004 is expected to be revised upwards by $31.6 million, or $0.08 per share after tax.
SunTrust said the expected restatement results from errors in input data used to calculate the first and second quarter 2004 allowances for loan losses related exclusively to the Company's indirect auto loan portfolio. The errors were uncovered during final preparation of third quarter financial results.
SunTrust's Audit Committee, with the assistance of its independent counsel, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, has begun an independent review of the errors, communications by certain SunTrust personnel to its independent auditors about the errors, loan loss reserve issues, and related matters. SunTrust said it is possible this review could result in additional restatements to previously issued financial statements, including further adjustments to first and second quarter 2004 results.
Pending completion of the Audit Committee review, SunTrust has placed certain officers on paid administrative leave, including Sandra W. Jansky, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, and Jorge Arrieta, Senior Vice President and Controller.
SunTrust said that as a matter of prudence it will postpone release of its third quarter 2004 results, originally scheduled for tomorrow (October 12, 2004), pending completion of the Audit Committee review.
SunTrust Chairman, President and CEO L. Phillip Humann said that "SunTrust has a long and well-deserved reputation for integrity in financial stewardship and we will manage this episode in a manner that ensures that reputation remains intact."
The following table details the expected restatement which, as described above, is subject to further review and potential revision:
