Exhibit 99.1SUNTRUST WILL ANNOUNCE THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS ON NOVEMBER 12; CONFIRMS EXPECTEDRESTATEMENT OF FIRST HALF 2004 RESULTS; PROVIDES UPDATE ON AUDIT COMMITTEEREVIEWNovember 10, 2004ATLANTA -- SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI - News) announced today that it hasfiled a Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing with the Securities and ExchangeCommission ("SEC") regarding the delayed filing of its Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 ("Form 10-Q"). The filing providesthe Company a five-day extension of the deadline to file the Form 10-Q. SunTrustintends to release its third quarter earnings, and file the Form 10-Q, onFriday, November 12, 2004. Conference call details will follow in a separatepress release.FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS 2004- ------------------------------SunTrust also confirmed that as a result of revisions to previously reportedquarterly allowances for loan losses, reported pre-tax income for the first andsecond quarters of 2004 is expected to be increased. SunTrust said that, whilethe review is not complete, it anticipates the aggregate amount of therestatement of pre-tax income for the six months ended June 30, 2004 to be thesame as, or slightly above, the amount indicated in the October 11, 2004announcement ($31.6 million, or $0.08 per share). The Company expects (i) theincrease in pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2004 to be lower than theexpected increase previously announced and (ii) the increase in pre-tax incomefor the second quarter of 2004 to be greater than the expected increasepreviously announced. Details of the quarterly restatements are expected to beannounced in connection with the Company's third quarter 2004 earnings.REPORT ON AUDIT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION AND SUNTRUST'S REVIEW- -------------------------------------------------------------SunTrust announced on October 11, 2004 that the Company's Audit Committee, withthe assistance of independent counsel, had initiated an independent review ofcertain errors in input data used to calculate the first and second quarter 2004allowances related to the Company's indirect auto loan portfolio, communicationsby certain SunTrust personnel to its independent auditors about the errors, loanloss reserve issues and related matters. The Audit Committee has now completedits investigation. Based on the results of the Audit Committee's investigationand SunTrust's review and analysis, SunTrust has determined that:     -    The Company's implementation of a new allowance framework in the first          quarter was deficient. The deficiencies included inadequate internal          control procedures, insufficient validation and testing of the new          framework, inadequate documentation and a failure to detect errors in          the allowance calculation.     -    There were numerous errors in the loan loss allowance calculations for          the first and second quarters, including data, model and formulaic          errors.     -    The Company's internal Allowance Committee did not properly          investigate and pursue the identified errors or other potential errors          in the allowance calculations in the first and second quarters. The          Allowance Committee did not adequately address potential issues and          concerns with the new allowance framework after suggestions of          problems came to light.     -    In connection with the financial reporting process for the Company's          third quarter results, certain members of the Company's management did          not treat certain matters raised by the Company's independent auditor          with an appropriate level of seriousness, failed to correct errors          identified and failed to advise the auditors of such errors. Further,          certain members of the Company's credit administration division (who          were subsequently placed on administrative leave) provided false draft          minutes of an Allowance Committee meeting to the independent auditor.
The Audit Committee concluded that when the independent auditor's concerns cameto the attention of senior management, specifically the Company's ChiefExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the matter was addressed promptlyand appropriately.As a result of these findings, management has concluded that there was amaterial weakness, which has not been fully remediated, in the Company'sinternal controls over financial reporting relating to the process ofestablishing the allowance. Further, based in part on recommendations of theAudit Committee, the Company has taken the following remedial actions:     -    The Company has advised three members of its credit administration          division, including its Chief Credit Officer, that their employment          with SunTrust will be terminated.     -    The Controller will be reassigned to a position in the Company with          responsibilities that involve areas other than accounting or financial          reporting.     -    The Allowance Committee has been reconstituted with certain members of          executive management, and the reconstituted Committee has determined          the appropriate level of reserves for each of the first, second and          third quarters of 2004. In addition, management reviewed the allowance          methodology and determinations for each of the quarters in the year          ended December 31, 2003 and determined that such financial statements          were unaffected.     -    Allowance policies and procedures have been, and are continuing to be,          documented and significantly augmented, and the Company has          established additional remediation plans to address internal control          deficiencies associated with the allowance framework. These include          additional documentation, training (including communications regarding          the importance of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in          connection with allowance calculations) and supervision, periodic          testing and periodic updates to the Audit Committee. Internal controls          surrounding the validation and testing of all systems and models          relating to the allowance process will be strengthened.Further, management will take steps to ensure that the Company's conservativecredit culture does not interfere with the application of GAAP in the allowancecalculation process. Accordingly, senior management will adopt a different tonewith respect to their communications regarding the application of GAAP to thedetermination of the allowance for loan losses.SunTrust Chairman, President and CEO L. Phillip Humann noted that "when weannounced our expected restatement and Audit Committee review of matters relatedto our loan loss reserve on October 11, we said we would deal with these issuesin a manner consistent with our long-standing commitment to integrity infinancial stewardship. We believe the actions announced today reflect thatcommitment. Looking ahead, should further improvements or enhancements in ourinternal controls be called for, we will move decisively to implement them."SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT- -------------------------------------In addition, the Company is undertaking a thorough review of its internalcontrols as a part of the Company's preparation for compliance with therequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404requires the Company's management to report on, and its independent auditors toattest to, the effectiveness of the Company's internal control structure andprocedures for financial reporting. Given the efforts needed to completelyremediate the internal control material weakness associated with the allowancefor loan and lease losses, as described above, the Company likely will not beable to fully remediate these deficiencies by December 31, 2004. In the eventthe Company has a material weakness in internal controls relating to the processof establishing its allowance at December 31, 2004, the Company's managementwill disclose such weakness in its report and will not be able to conclude thatthe Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at suchdate. Similarly, the Company believes any such material weakness would bereferenced in an adverse attestation report from its independent auditors. Amaterial weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of controldeficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a materialmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be preventedor detected.
