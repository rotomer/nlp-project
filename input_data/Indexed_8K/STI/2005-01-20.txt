The Company disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the 2004 third quarter thatthere was a material weakness in the Company's internal controls over financialreporting relating to the process of establishing the allowance for loan andlease losses and that the Company would likely not be able to fully remediatethe weakness in internal controls by December 31, 2004. Although significantremedial actions have been taken, SunTrust was not able to fully remediate thematerial weakness in internal controls as of December 31, 2004. As a result,management will disclose this material weakness in internal controls in itsreport in the Company's Form 10-K and indicate that the Company's internalcontrols over financial reporting were not effective at such date. In addition,the Company expects that the material weakness will result in an adverse opinionby the Company's independent auditors on the effectiveness of the Company'sinternal controls.

=========(1) SunTrust presents total revenue excluding realized securities gains/losses.    The Company believes total revenue without securities gains/losses is more    indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is    primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. See    Appendix A for a reconcilement of this non-GAAP performance measure.(2) SunTrust presents a return on average assets and return on average realized    equity which exclude realized and unrealized securities gains/losses and    dividends from The Coca-Cola Company. The foregoing numbers reflect    primarily adjustments to remove the effects of the Company's securities    portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares    of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to    gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the    return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more    indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately    reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core    businesses which are primarily customer relationship and customer    transaction driven. The Company also believes that the return on average    realized equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because    the excluded equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific    security. See Appendix A for a reconcilement of these non-GAAP performance    measures.(3) The net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully    taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored    status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes    this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income    and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.(4) Current period tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are    estimated as of the press release date.(5) Purchased liabilities include foreign and brokered deposits, funds purchased    and other short-term borrowings.

  268.1(1) SunTrust presents total revenue excluding realized securities gains/losses.    The Company believes total revenue without securities gains/losses is more    indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is    primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. See    Appendix A for a reconcilement of this non-GAAP performance measure.(2) The net interest margin is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) and    annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income    from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be    the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides    relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.(3) SunTrust presents a return on average assets and return on average realized    equity which exclude realized and unrealized securities gains/losses and    dividends from The Coca-Cola Company. The foregoing numbers reflect    primarily adjustments to remove the effects of the Company's securities    portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares    of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to    gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the    return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more    indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately    reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core    businesses which are primarily customer relationship and customer    transaction driven. The Company also believes that the return on average    realized equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because    the excluded equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific    security. See Appendix A for a reconcilement of these non-GAAP performance    measures.                                     Page 5
