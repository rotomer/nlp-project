L. Phillip Humann Chairman and CEO
Smith Barney Citigroup
Financial Services Conference
January 2005
This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust") and National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), including future financial and operating results, SunTrust's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of SunTrust's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; increased competition and its effects on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the U.S. and internationally. Additional factors that could cause SunTrust's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the 2003 Annual Reports on Form 10-K of SunTrust and NCF, and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and 10-Q/A of SunTrust and NCF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov). The forward-looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of the filing, and SunTrust does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
This presentation could include some non-GAAP measures to describe SunTrust's performance. The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in SunTrust's earnings press release, on SunTrust's website in the press release section of the Investor Relations pages and in the appendix of this presentation.

Core revenue per share is calculated by dividing total revenue excluding securities gains and losses by average diluted shares for the quarter. The Company believes core revenue is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven.
Total Revenue Growth for SunTrust was 27% 4Q 04 over 4Q 03 and 7% for 4Q 03 over 4Q 02, on a historical combined basis total revenue growth for SunTrust was 5% 4Q 04 over 4Q 03

APPENDIX
SunTrust presents a return on average assets and return on average realized equity which exclude realized and unrealized securities gains/losses and dividends from The Coca- Cola Company. The foregoing numbers reflect primarily adjustments to remove the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security
Annualized
      
SunTrust presents selected financial data on an operating basis that excludes merger charges. The Company believes the exclusion of the merger charges, which represent incremental costs to integrate NCF's operations, is more reflective of normalized operations
