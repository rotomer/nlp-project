The completion of the Bank Mergers is subject to a number of conditions andreceipt of all required regulatory approvals. Although it is currentlyanticipated that the Bank Mergers will take place in the second quarter of 2005,no assurance can be given as to when, or if, the Bank Mergers will occur.SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial informationhas been prepared to reflect the Bank Mergers. The unaudited pro forma condensedcombined balance sheet presents how the combined balance sheets of NBC, NBCFSB,BankCard and the Bank (the "Merged Banks") may have appeared had the businessesactually been combined as of December 31, 2004. The unaudited pro formacondensed combined income statement presents how the combined income statementsof the Merged Banks may have appeared had the businesses actually been combinedas of January 1, 2004.     The mergers of NBC and NBCFSB with and into the Bank are being accountedfor using the purchase method of accounting; accordingly, SunTrust Banks' costto acquire NBC was allocated to the assets (including identifiable intangibleassets such as core deposit intangibles) and liabilities at their respectivefair values on the date the Holding Company Merger was consummated (October 1,2004). The merger of BankCard with and into the Bank is being accounted for on apooling-like basis due to both entities being under common control.     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information ispresented for informational purposes only. Certain amounts in the historicalconsolidated financial statements of NBC have been reclassified to conform withthe Bank's historical financial information presentation. The unaudited proforma condensed combined financial information presented in this document doesnot necessarily indicate the results of operations or the combined financialposition that would have resulted had the merger been completed at the beginningof the applicable periods presented, nor is it indicative of the results ofoperations in future periods or the future financial position of the combinedbank.     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information under thebank headings is based on the Call Reports of the Bank, BankCard and NBC and,with respect to NBCFSB, on its Thrift Financial Reports. The Call Reports ofeach of the Bank and NBC include the financial information of the Bank and itsconsolidated subsidiaries, and NBC and its consolidated subsidiaries,respectively.     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement does notreflect (a) anticipated expenses and nonrecurring charges that may result fromthe Holding Company Merger and the Bank Mergers, (b) estimated expense savingsand revenue enhancements anticipated to result from the Holding Company Mergerand the Bank Mergers and (c) any changes required or which may be required byany regulatory authority. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financialinformation does not reflect the issuance of $300 million of 5.40% Fixed RateSubordinated Notes of
SunTrust Bank due 2020 and $200 million of Floating Rate Subordinated Notes ofSunTrust Bank due 2015, which were both issued on March 24, 2005.     Additionally, effective February 2005, NBC Capital Markets, formerly asubsidiary of NBC, merged with and into SunTrust Capital Markets, which is not asubsidiary of the Bank. NBC Capital Markets had total assets of $442.5 million,total liabilities of $337.1 million, and total equity capital of $105.5 millionas of December 31, 2004.
