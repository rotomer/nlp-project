SunTrust Reports First Quarter 2005 Earnings
Company Says Positive Trends Continue and NCF Merger Integration Remains on Track
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the first quarter of 2005 of $492.3 million, up from $361.8 million in the first quarter of 2004. Net income per diluted share was $1.36, up 6% from the $1.28 per diluted share earned in the first quarter of 2004. Operating income per diluted share was $1.40, up 9% from the first quarter of 2004. Operating income does not include $16.0 million of after-tax merger charges incurred in the first quarter associated with SunTrust's acquisition of National Commerce Financial Corporation (NCF), which closed on October 1, 2004. Included in the net income and operating income per diluted share for the first quarter was a net gain on the sale of factoring assets from a division of SunTrust, Receivables Capital Management (RCM), to CIT Group, Inc. The net gain on a pre-tax basis was $19.9 million and on an after-tax basis was $12.3 million, and it accounted for a $.03 increase in net income and operating net income per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005.
"We are pleased to report that during the first quarter SunTrust continued to build on the positive trends established in 2004," said L. Phillip Humann, SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our first quarter results benefited from increasingly robust net interest income growth, excellent credit quality and a continuation of effective cost control." Mr. Humann said net interest income growth in the first quarter resulted from a continuation of strong overall loan growth. He also noted that credit quality trends are the best experienced in a number of years, and that noninterest expenses decreased from the prior quarter.
Mr. Humann also noted that the NCF merger integration is proceeding according to plan and reiterated the Company's expectation that all business, customer and financial merger goals will be met.
Discussion of Historical Results and Estimated Historical Combined Results
In order to assist investors in comparing the financial results of the now-combined SunTrust and National Commerce Financial Corporation, estimated historical combined information for first quarter 2004 is presented as if the merger had been completed at the beginning of the period presented. In management's view, the estimated historical combined financial results assist investors in better understanding the comparative performance and underlying growth dynamics of the combined Company. For further information regarding the estimated historical combined financial information, including reconciliations of certain financial information, please see Appendix B.
First Quarter 2005 Summary:
Financial Performance
For the quarter, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was 1.24%, and return on average total equity (ROE) was 12.39%. Excluding realized and unrealized securities gains and losses and dividends from The Coca-Cola Company, return on average total assets was 1.23% and return on average total realized equity was 13.23%. Operating ROA and ROE, which excludes merger charges, was 1.28% and 12.79%, respectively.
Revenue
Total revenue was $1,883.0 million for the first quarter of 2005, up $424.1 million from the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, total revenue was up 6% from the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, total revenue excluding securities gains and losses and the net gain on sale of factoring assets was up 6% from the first quarter of 2004. Revenue growth was driven by improvements in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable net interest income was $1,129.2 million in the first quarter of 2005, up from $863.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, fully taxable net interest income was up 7% from the first quarter of 2004. Factors driving the net interest income growth have been the improving net interest margin, strong loan growth particularly in residential real estate and home equity lending, and growth in low cost deposits. The net interest margin for the first quarter of 2005 was 3.25%, up four basis points from the fourth quarter of 2004 due to the difference in the number of days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $753.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, up from $595.1 million for the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, total noninterest income for the first quarter was up 5% from the first quarter of 2004. Noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses was $759.5 million for the first quarter of 2005, up from $590.2 million for the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses for the first quarter was up 9% from the first quarter of 2004.
Included in noninterest income in the first quarter of 2005 was the net gain on the sale of factoring assets, which totaled $19.9 million. Noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of factoring assets for the first quarter of 2005 was up 6% from the first quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis.
A significant driver of the increase in noninterest income has been growth in trust and investment management income, which was up 8% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2005 was $1,133.9 million, up from $889.7 million for the first quarter of 2004 and down from $1,149.0 in the fourth quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, total noninterest expense was up 8% in the first quarter of 2005 from the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, noninterest expense before amortization of intangible assets and merger expenses in the first quarter of 2005 was $1,077.0 million,
up 5% from $1,024.2 million in the first quarter of 2004 and down 1% from $1,088.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Compared to the fourth quarter, cost control effectiveness was evident in several noninterest expense categories, with decreases in net occupancy and marketing and customer development. Cost savings from the merger integration amounted to $8 million in the first quarter of 2005. The Company's reported efficiency ratio was 60.22% for the first quarter of 2005, and its operating efficiency ratio was 58.85%. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio, which excludes merger expenses and the net gain on the sale of factoring assets, was 59.48%.
Balance Sheet
At March 31, 2005, SunTrust had total assets of $164.8 billion. Equity capital of $16.1 billion represented 10% of total assets. Book value per share was $44.59, up from $44.30 on December 31, 2004.
Loans
Average loans for the first quarter of 2005 were $103.2 billion, up from $79.9 billion for the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, average loans were up 11% from the first quarter of 2004. Loan growth was strong across-the-board, with home equity and residential real estate segments continuing to be particularly robust. Commercial and commercial real estate and construction loan growth accelerated in the first quarter of 2005, growing at 15% and 12% on a sequential annualized basis, respectively. Commercial loan growth was experienced in all segments, including large corporate loans that had stabilized in the second half of 2004 and increased in the first quarter of 2005.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter of 2005 were $91.0 billion, up 29% from $70.4 billion for the first quarter of 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter were up 9% from the first quarter of 2004. The growth in deposits was driven by increases in low cost deposit segments, with NOW balances increasing 21% and DDA balances increasing 11% over the first quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. Consumer and other time balances also experienced growth, increasing 12% over the first quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. A significant portion of this growth can be attributed to the effective implementation of the Company's sales and customer retention initiatives.
Asset Quality
Due to the continued strength of the credit quality in SunTrust's loan and lease portfolio, there was a $26.3 million reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses from December 31, 2004 to March 31, 2005. Net charge-offs were $36.8 million in the first quarter of 2005 and the provision for loan losses was $10.6 million. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2005 were 0.14% of average loans, down from 0.30% of average loans in the first quarter of 2004.
Nonperforming assets were $392.3 million at March 31, 2005 or 0.37% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets, as compared to $331.9 million or 0.42% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets at March 31, 2004. On an estimated historical combined basis, nonperforming assets were down 1% from March 31, 2004. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2005 included $357.1 million in nonperforming loans, $27.6 million in other real estate owned and $7.7 million in other repossessed assets. The allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31, 2005 was $1,023.7 million and represented 0.98% of loans and 286.7% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust believes its net charge-off and nonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the most recently published industry averages.
