Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 19, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Registrant") agreed to amend the Registrant's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SunTrust SERP"). The amendment will provide that the formula for the calculation of the payments to Mr. Thomas M. Garrott under the SunTrust SERP will be based upon Mr. Garrott's compensation at not less than his highest levels of participation of coverage during the last twelve months that Mr. Garrott was employed on active status. The revised compensation amount that will be included in the formula to determine Mr. Garrott's benefit under the SunTrust SERP is $1,737,500. Mr. Garrott was the Chairman of the Board of National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), which merged into SunTrust Banks, Inc. effective October 1, 2004. At the time of the aforementioned merger, Mr. Garrott was employed on part-time status with NCF pursuant to the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with NCF dated March 18, 2002, as amended by the First Amendment to Restated Employment Agreement dated March 18, 2002. The Registrant continues to employ Mr. Garrott pursuant to the terms of such agreement and the revisions to the SERP are required by the terms of such agreement. Mr. Garrott currently serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the Registrant.
On April 19, 2005, the shareholders of the Registrant approved an amendment to the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP"). The MIP was amended to increase the maximum award payable to any individual from $2 million to $5 million. In addition, the business criteria on which performance goals are based were changed to parallel those contained in the 2004 Stock Plan of the Registrant. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Management Incentive Plan, amended and restated as of March 14, 2005, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. For 2005 the Compensation Committee set the financial objectives under the MIP as a percentage of after tax net operating income for the Registrant.
On April 19, 2005, the shareholders of the Registrant approved an amendment to the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Performance Unit Plan (the "PUP"). The PUP was amended to increase the maximum award payable to an individual from $2 million to an amount equal to .5% of the Registrant's net income for the last year of a PUP performance cycle, less the value of any of the Registrant's restricted stock or stock units granted in the first year of the PUP performance cycle. In addition, the business criteria on which performance goals are based were changed to parallel those contained in the 2004 Stock Plan of the Registrant. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Performance Unit Plan, amended and restated as of March 14, 2005, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. For the 2005-2007 PUP cycle the Compensation Committee set the performance measures based on the Registrant's consolidated earnings growth for the cycle. The performance measures are net operating earnings and earnings per share.
On April 19, 2005, each of the members of the Registrant's Board of Directors was granted either 1,200 shares of restricted stock or 1,200 restricted stock units pursuant to the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan.

added will be paid an award for any cycle to the extent such payment, when addedto all his other compensation for such year, would be nondeductible underSection 162(m) of the Code.     2.

Thesegoals may be established in any manner the Committee deems appropriate,including achievement on an absolute or a relative basis as compared to peergroups or indexes, and these goals may be established as multiple goals or asalternative goals. The Committee shall fix a minimum Performance Goal for thecycle, and the Final Value of such units shall be equal to zero if actualperformance falls below the minimum, as established by the Committee. TheCommittee shall also fix a maximum Performance Goal and such other PerformanceGoals which fall between the minimum and maximum Performance Goals as theCommittee shall deem appropriate, with corresponding Final Values for suchunits.

In determiningwhether any Performance Goal has been satisfied, the Committee may exclude anyor all extraordinary items (as determined under U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles), and any other unusual or non-recurring items, includingbut not limited to, charges or costs associated with restructurings of theCorporation, discontinued operations and the cumulative effects of accountingchanges.

No individual may receive an award forany Performance Measurement Cycle in excess of .5% of Net Income for the lastcalendar year of such Performance Measurement Cycle reduced by (1) the FairMarket Value of any restricted stock grant made (as such Fair Market Value isdetermined on the date the restricted stock grant is made) by the Corporation tosuch individual during the first calendar year of such Performance MeasurementCycle and (2) the Fair Market Value of the shares of stock described in anyrestricted stock unit grants made (as such Fair Market Value is determined onthe date the restricted stock unit grant is made) by the Corporation to suchindividual during the first calendar year of such Performance Measurement Cycle.Section 7.
