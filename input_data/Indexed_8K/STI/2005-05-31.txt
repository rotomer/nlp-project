reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or allegedomission.

("SunTrust Banks") andSunTrust Bank (the "Bank") and, together with other attorneys under mysupervision have acted as counsel to the Bank and SunTrust Banks, in connectionwith the execution today (i) by you and the Bank of the Amended and RestatedDistribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement"), (ii) by SunTrust Banks ofthe Representations Certificate pursuant to Section 6(c) of the DistributionAgreement (the "Representations Certificate"), and (iii) by the Bank andDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Bank AG London, Deutsche BankLuxembourg S.A. (together, the "Paying Agents") and Kredietbank S.A.Luxembourgeoise of the Amended and Restated Global Agency Agreement (the "GlobalAgency Agreement"), the Amended and Restated Interest Calculation Agreementbetween the Bank and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas dated as of March 31,2004 (the "Interest Calculation Agreement"), the Amended and Restated ExchangeRate Agent Agreement between the Bank and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americasdated March 31, 2004 (the "Exchange Rate Agent Agreement) and (iv) by the Bank,Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and The Depository Trust Company of theShort-Term and Medium-Term Letters of Representations (the "Letters ofRepresentations"), all of which are dated March 31, 2004, relating to theissuance and sale by the Bank of its (i) senior bank notes (the "Senior Notes")and (ii) subordinated bank notes (the "Subordinated Notes" and together with theSenior Notes, the "Bank Notes"). The Bank Notes have maturities of 7 days to 30years or more from date of issue. This opinion letter is furnished pursuant toSection 6(a)(i) of the Distribution Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein andnot otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Distribution Agreement.     In arriving at the opinions expressed below, I have examined and relied onthe following documents:     (a)  an executed copy of the Distribution Agreement, the Representations          Certificate, the Global Agency Agreement, the Exchange Rate Agent          Agreement and the Interest Calculation Agreement;     (b)  the Offering Circular;                                       B-1
(c)  specimens of the Bank Notes; and     (d)  the documents delivered to you by the Bank and SunTrust Banks at the          closing pursuant to the Distribution Agreement.In addition, I have examined and relied on the originals or copies certified orotherwise identified to my satisfaction of all such corporate records of theBank and SunTrust Banks and such other instruments and other certificates ofpublic officials, officers and representatives of the Bank and SunTrust Banksand such other persons, and I have made such investigations of law, as I havedeemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below. In rendering theopinions expressed below, I have assumed and have not verified that thesignatures on all documents that I have examined are genuine, that all copies ofdocuments that I have examined conform to the originals thereof, and that theBank Notes conform to the specimen thereof that I have examined.     Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:          1. The Bank is a banking corporation validly existing and in good     standing under the laws of the State of Georgia. SunTrust Banks is a     corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the     State of Georgia and is licensed, registered or qualified to conduct the     business in which it is engaged in each jurisdiction in which the conduct     of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such     license, registration or qualification, except to the extent that the     failure to be so licensed, registered or qualified or to be in good     standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Bank and its     subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of     SunTrust Banks, which has securities registered under the Securities     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.          2. The Distribution Agreement, the Global Agency Agreement, the     Interest Calculation Agreement, the Exchange Rate Agent Agreement and the     Letters of Representations have been duly authorized, executed and     delivered by the Bank and, assuming due authorization, execution and     delivery by all parties thereto other than the Bank, are legal, valid,     binding and enforceable agreements of the Bank, subject to applicable     bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,     moratorium, conservatorship, receivership, and similar laws of general     applicability relating to, or affecting, creditors' rights and subject, as     to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether     enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).          3. The Representations Certificate has been duly authorized, executed     and delivered by a duly authorized officer of SunTrust Banks and, assuming     due authorization, execution and delivery of the Distribution Agreement,     the Global Agency Agreement, the Interest Calculation Agreement and the     Exchange Rate Agent Agreement by all parties thereto other than the Bank,     is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable agreement of SunTrust Banks,     subject to applicable bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency, fraudulent     transfer, reorganization, moratorium, conservatorship, receivership and     similar laws of general                                       B-2
applicability relating to, or affecting, creditors' rights and subject, as     to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether     enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).          4. The Bank Notes have been duly authorized for issuance and sale     pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and, when issued and authenticated     against payment of the consideration therefor, the Bank Notes will be     legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Bank, subject to     applicable bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,     reorganization, moratorium, conservatorship, receivership, and similar laws     of general applicability relating to, or affecting creditors rights and     subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless     of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).          5. The execution, issuance and delivery by the Bank of the Bank Notes,     the execution, delivery and performance by the Bank of the Distribution     Agreement, the Global Agency Agreement, the Interest Calculation Agreement,     the Exchange Rate Agency Agreement, the Letters of Representations and any     agreement by an agent party to the Distribution Agreement to purchase the     Bank Notes as principal, and the execution, delivery and performance by     SunTrust Banks of the Representations Certificate, do not violate any law,     rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to SunTrust Banks     and its subsidiaries or the Bank and its subsidiaries (including without     limitation, Sections 7-1-291 and 7-1-419 of the Official Code of Georgia),     if any, or violate any provision of each of the Bank's or SunTrust Banks'     Charter, Bylaws, or Articles of Incorporation, as the case may be, or     conflict with or result in a material breach of or constitute a material     default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any material     lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of SunTrust Banks     and its subsidiaries or the Bank and its subsidiaries, if any, pursuant to     any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other     instrument known to me to which SunTrust Banks or any of its subsidiaries     or the Bank and its subsidiaries if any, or the property of any of them, is     bound or subject.          6. The Bank Notes are exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(2)     of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and neither     registration of the Bank Notes under the 1933 Act, nor qualification of an     indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, is required in     connection with the offer, sale, issuance or delivery of the Bank Notes     pursuant to the Distribution Agreement or any applicable agreement by an     agent party to the Distribution Agreement to purchase the Bank Notes as     principal.          7. The Bank is not required to register under the provisions of the     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act").          8. No consent, approval or authorization of or filing with any Federal     or Georgia governmental body or agency is required for the performance by     the Bank of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement, the Global     Agency                                       B-3
Agreement, the Interest Calculation Agreement, the Exchange Rate Agent     Agreement, and any applicable agreement by an agent party to the     Distribution Agreement to purchase the Bank Notes as principal or the Bank     Notes, except (A) such as may be required by the securities or Blue Sky     laws of the various states in connection with the offer and sale of the     Bank Notes and (B) with respect to Subordinated Notes, such approvals of     the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance as are required by Section     7-1-419 of the Official Code of Georgia, which approvals have been     obtained.          9. The Bank Notes conform in all material respects to the description     thereof contained in the Offering Circular under the caption "Description     of Notes."          10. The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations     of the Bank, and rank pari passu among themselves and with all other     unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Bank except, (A)     pursuant to Section 11(d)(11) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the     Bank's unsecured deposit obligations and (B) pursuant to Section 7-1-202 of     the Official Code of Georgia, the Bank's deposit obligations. The     Subordinated Notes are unsecured and subordinated debt obligations of the     Bank, rank pari passu among themselves, and are subordinate and junior in     right of payment to the Bank's obligations to its depositors and general     creditors, other than obligations which, by their express terms, rank on a     parity with or junior to the Subordinated Notes.          11. Except as may be set forth in the Offering Circular, there is no     action, suit or proceeding before or by any court or governmental agency or     body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or, to my knowledge, threatened     against or affecting, SunTrust Banks or any of its subsidiaries or the Bank     and its subsidiaries, if any, which if determined adversely to SunTrust     Banks or any of its subsidiaries or the Bank and its subsidiaries, as the     case may be, could reasonably be expected to result in any material adverse     change in the financial condition, or in the earnings or business affairs,     of SunTrust Banks and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Bank and     its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or could reasonably be expected to     materially and adversely affect the consummation of the Distribution     Agreement, the Global Agency Agreement, the Interest Calculation Agreement,     the Exchange Rate Agent Agreement or the Bank Notes or any transaction     contemplated thereby.     Because the primary purpose of my role in the transaction was not toestablish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statisticalmatters and because of the wholly or partially non-legal character of many ofthe statements contained in the Offering Circular, I am not passing upon and donot assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of thestatements contained in the Offering Circular and I make no representation thatI have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of suchstatements.

included in the Offering Circular, and I have not examined the accounting,financial or statistical records from which such financial statements, schedulesand data are derived. I note that, while certain portions of the OfferingCircular (including financial statements and schedules) have been includedtherein on the authority of "experts" within the meaning of the 1933 Act, asamended, I am not such an expert with respect to any portion of the OfferingCircular, including without limitation such financial statements or schedules orthe other financial or statistical data included therein.     I advise you that no information has come to my attention that causes me tobelieve that the Offering Circular (other than the financial statements andschedules and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to whichI express no view) as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains anuntrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material factnecessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of thecircumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
