(NYSE: STI) today reported net income for thesecond quarter of 2005 of $465.7 million, up from $386.6 million in the secondquarter of 2004. Net income per diluted share was $1.28, down from the $1.36 perdiluted share earned in the second quarter of 2004. Operating income per dilutedshare was $1.37, up 1% from the second quarter of 2004. Operating income doesnot include $33.6 million of after-tax merger charges incurred in the secondquarter of 2005 associated with SunTrust's acquisition of National CommerceFinancial Corporation (NCF), which closed on October 1, 2004.         "Strong revenue growth coupled with effective cost control led to thecontinuation of positive operating trends this quarter," said L. Phillip Humann,SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Hallmarks of the quarterincluded significant loan and deposit growth, evidence of the success that salesand customer retention initiatives are having. In addition, credit qualityremained excellent with charge-offs near historically low levels. These positivetrends helped offset an increase in provision for loan losses necessary toaccommodate another quarter of very strong loan growth."DISCUSSION OF HISTORICAL RESULTS AND ESTIMATED HISTORICAL COMBINED RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------         In order to assist investors in comparing the financial results of thenow-combined SunTrust and NCF, estimated historical combined information for thesecond quarter and first six months of 2004 is presented as if the merger hadbeen completed at the beginning of the period presented. In management's view,the estimated historical combined financial results assist investors in betterunderstanding the comparative performance and underlying growth dynamics of thecombined Company. For further information regarding the estimated historicalcombined financial information, including reconciliations of certain financialinformation, please see Appendix B.         Furthermore, NCF's systems applications were converted to SunTrust'ssystems applications in April 2005. In some cases, NCF classified loans anddeposits differently for financial reporting compared to the SunTrustmethodology. While prior to the conversion NCF loan and deposit accounts weremapped as closely as possible to SunTrust classifications, it was anticipatedthat additional reclassifications could occur once the system conversions werecompleted. As a result, to better ascertain underlying growth dynamics of thecombined Company, sequential annualized growth rates adjusted for estimatedreclassifications have been provided. In management's view, sequentialannualized growth rates adjusted for estimated reclassifications assistinvestors in better understanding the comparative performance and underlyinggrowth dynamics of loans and deposits for the combined Company. For furtherinformation regarding the consolidated daily average balances for loans anddeposits for the first and second quarters of 2005, adjusted for estimatedreclassifications that arose as a result of the systems conversions, please seeAppendix C.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE- ---------------------         For the quarter, reported return on average total assets (ROA) was1.13% and return on average total equity (ROE) was 11.48%. Excluding netrealized and unrealized securities gains and losses and dividends from TheCoca-Cola Company, return on average assets was 1.11% and return on averagerealized equity was 12.02%. Operating ROA and ROE, which excludes mergercharges, was 1.21% and 12.31%, respectively.         For the first six months of 2005, the Company reported net income of$958.0 million, up from $748.4 million earned in the same period in 2004. Netincome per diluted share was $2.64, flat from the same period in 2004. Operatingnet income per diluted share was $2.77 for the first six months of 2005, up 5%from the same period in 2004. ROA for the first six months of 2005 was 1.18% andROE was 11.93%. Excluding net realized and unrealized securities gains andlosses and dividends from The Coca-Cola Company, return on average assets wasone basis point lower and return on average realized equity was 68 basis pointshigher than the reported returns.REVENUE- -------         Total revenue was $1,913.3 million for the second quarter of 2005, upfrom $1,507.8 million in the second quarter of 2004. On an estimated historicalcombined basis, total revenue was up 5% from the second quarter of 2004. On asequential annualized basis, total revenue, excluding securities gains andlosses and the net gain on sale of Receivables Capital Management (RCM)factoring assets that occurred in the first quarter, increased 10%. Revenuegrowth was driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterestincome.         For the first six months of 2005, total revenue was $3,796.4 million,up from $2,966.7 million for the same period in 2004. On an estimated historicalcombined basis, for the first six months of 2005, total revenue was up 5% fromthe same period in 2004. Revenue growth for the first six months of 2005 wasalso driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.NET INTEREST INCOME         Fully taxable net interest income was $1,142.4 million in the secondquarter of 2005, up from $885.1 million in the second quarter of 2004. On anestimated historical combined basis, fully taxable net interest income was up 6%from the second quarter of 2004. The primary factors driving the net interestincome growth year-over-year have been strong loan growth and year-over-yearimprovement in net interest margin. On an estimated historical combined basis,loans have grown 13% on average from the second quarter of 2004. The netinterest margin improved from 3.13% for the second quarter of 2004 to 3.16% forthe second quarter of 2005. The net interest margin of 3.16% for the secondquarter of 2005 was down nine basis points from the first quarter of 2005 due toa number of factors, including: 1) the reversal of the day count benefit thatoccurred in the first quarter; 2) the mix of both the strong incremental loangrowth and how the growth was funded had a dilutive effect on net interestmargin; 3) an increase in loans held for sale at a compressed margin; 4)increases in deposit pricing to remain competitive; and 5) the impact of theflattening yield curve during the second quarter. Although net interest margindeclined in the second quarter of 2005, fully taxable net interest incomeincreased 5% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2005 on asequential annualized basis.         For the first six months of 2005, fully taxable net interest income was$2,271.7 million, up from $1,749.0 million for the same period in 2004. On anestimated historical combined basis for the first six months of 2005, fullytaxable net interest income was up 6% from the same period in 2004.NONINTEREST INCOME         Total noninterest income was $770.9 million for the second quarter of2005, up from $622.7 million for the second quarter of 2004. On an estimatedhistorical combined basis, total noninterest income for the second quarter wasup 3% from the second quarter of 2004. Comparing the second quarter to the firstquarter of 2005, total noninterest income excluding securities gains and lossesand the net gain on sale of RCM factoring assets that occurred in the firstquarter increased 17% on a
sequential annualized basis. Drivers of the increase in noninterest income havebeen growth in service charge fee income, trust and investment management incomeand mortgage related income.         For the first six months of 2005, noninterest income excludingsecurities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM factoring assetswas $1,510.5 million, up from $1,221.9 million for the same period in 2004. Onan estimated historical combined basis for the first six months of 2005,noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses and the net gain on thesale of RCM factoring assets was up 4% from the same period in 2004.NONINTEREST EXPENSE- -------------------         Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2005 was $1,172.8million, up from $928.4 million for the second quarter of 2004. On an estimatedhistorical combined basis, total noninterest expense before amortization ofintangible assets and merger expenses was up 1% from the second quarter of 2004.Comparing the second quarter to the first quarter of 2005, total noninterestexpense before amortization of intangible assets and merger expenses increased4% on a sequential annualized basis. Cost savings from the merger integrationamounted to $18 million in the second quarter of 2005, bringing the total costsavings to $26 million for the first six months of 2005.         The Company's reported efficiency ratio was 61.30% for the secondquarter of 2005 compared to 60.22% for the first quarter of 2005. The operatingefficiency ratio, which excludes the impact of merger expenses, was 58.46%. Thiscompares favorably to the first quarter operating efficiency ratio of 58.85% andthe adjusted operating efficiency ratio, which excludes the impact of the netgain on sale of RCM factoring assets in addition to merger expenses, of 59.48%.         For the first six months of 2005, total noninterest expense was$2,306.7 million, up from $1,818.2 million for the same period of 2004. For thefirst six months of 2005, total noninterest expense before amortization ofintangible assets and merger expenses was up 3% from the same period of 2004 onan estimated historical combined basis.BALANCE SHEET- -------------         At June 30, 2005, SunTrust had total assets of $169.0 billion. Equitycapital of $16.6 billion represented 10% of total assets. Book value per sharewas $45.96, up from $44.59 on March 31, 2005.LOANS         Average loans for the second quarter of 2005 were $107.0 billion, upfrom $80.9 billion for the second quarter of 2004. On an estimated historicalcombined basis, average loans were up 13% from the second quarter of 2004. On asequential annualized basis, average loans grew 15% from the first quarter tothe second quarter of 2005. Areas of strongest growth in the consumer categorywere residential real estate, home equity and consumer direct. Commercial loangrowth was strong across all market segments.DEPOSITS         Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter of 2005were $93.1 billion, up from $73.2 billion for the second quarter of 2004. On anestimated historical combined basis, average consumer and commercial depositsfor the second quarter were up 8% from the second quarter of 2004. On asequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 9%from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualizedbasis adjusted for estimated reclassifications, noninterest-bearing and timedeposit growth was particularly strong in the second quarter. Time depositgrowth was enhanced through a marketing campaign that began in the first quarterand continued through a portion of the second quarter.ASSET QUALITY- -------------         Credit quality trends continued to improve in the second quarter of2005. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2005 were 0.13% of average loans,down from 0.14% of average loans in the first quarter of 2005 and 0.19% ofaverage loans in the second quarter of 2004. Net charge-offs were $35.4 millionin the second quarter of 2005 compared to $36.8 million in the first quarter of2005.
Nonperforming assets were $380.3 million at June 30, 2005 or 0.35% of loans,other real estate owned and other repossessed assets, as compared to $392.3million or 0.37% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assetsat March 31, 2005.         Although the credit trends continued to improve, the allowance for loanand lease losses was increased to $1,036.2 million at June 30, 2005 from$1,023.7 million at March 31, 2005 to accommodate the continuation ofsignificant loan growth. Provision expense increased from $10.6 million in thefirst quarter of 2005 to $47.8 million in the second quarter of 2005 as a resultof the need to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowancefor loan and leases losses at June 30, 2005 represented 0.95% of loans and296.7% of nonperforming loans. SunTrust believes its net charge-off andnonperforming asset levels continue to compare very favorably with the mostrecently published industry averages.ELIMINATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------         SunTrust disclosed that there was a material weakness in the Company'sinternal control over financial reporting relating to the allowance for loan andlease losses initially in its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2004, in thesubsequent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and in the Form 10-Qfor the first quarter of 2005. Management has determined that SunTrust haseliminated the material weakness in internal control over financial reportingrelating to the allowance for loan and lease losses through a series of remedialactions undertaken since the identification of the material weakness.CORRESPONDING FINANCIAL TABLES AND INFORMATION- ----------------------------------------------         To view the corresponding financial tables and information, pleaserefer to the Investor Relations section located under "About SunTrust" on ourWeb site at www.suntrust.com.

The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored     status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes     this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest     income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable     amounts.(3)  Current period tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are     estimated as of the press release date.

measures.(2)  The net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully     taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored     status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes     this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest     income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable     amounts.(3)  Current period tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are     estimated as of the press release date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------(1)  SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains     on securities. The foregoing numbers reflect primarily adjustments to     remove the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the     ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.     The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual     performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on     average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative     of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the     return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses     which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven.     The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is     computed by dividing annualized net income, excluding securities     gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, by average assets less net     unrealized securities gains.(2)  The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is     more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded     equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security. The     return on average realized shareholders' equity is computed by dividing     annualized net income, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola     Company dividend, by average realized shareholders' equity.(3)  SunTrust presents total noninterest income and total revenue excluding     realized securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM     assets. The Company believes total noninterest income and total revenue     without securities gains and losses is more indicative of the Company's     performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain is more indicative of normalized operations.(4)  Multiply by 4 to calculate sequential annualized growth or reductions     discussed in the earnings call.

Those     changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.(2)  Includes service charges on deposits, card and other charges and fees.(3)  Includes retail investment services, investment banking income and trading     account profits and commissions.(4)  SunTrust presents noninterest income before securities (losses)/gains and     the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(5)  The Company presents noninterest expense before amortization of intangible     assets and merger expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these     measures provides better comparability and is more reflective of normalized     operations.(6)  SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the     respective categories to conform to the NCF presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.(8)  See Appendix C for the impact of the estimated reclassification adjustments     resulting from the April 22, 2005 NCF systems conversion.

The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(4)  The Company presents noninterest expense before amortization of intangible     assets and merger expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these     measures provides better comparability and is more reflective of normalized     operations.(5)  NCF's FTE adjustments were reduced $4.4 million and $9.1 million from the     second quarter and first six months of 2004, respectively, to conform to     SunTrust's methodology.(6)  SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the     respective categories to conform to the NCF presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.

The Company believes these adjusted measures provide a better     comparison between reporting periods and are more indicative of true loan     and deposit fluctuations. The adjustments represent reclassifications due     to account mapping changes resulting from the systems conversion.(2)  Multiply percentage change by 4 to calculate sequential annualized change.     Any sequential annualized change over 100 percent is labled as "NM." Those     changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.                                    Page 16
