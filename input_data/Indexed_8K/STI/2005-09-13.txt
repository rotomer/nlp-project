This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust") and National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), including future financial and operating results, SunTrust's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of SunTrust's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; increased competition and its effects on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the U.S. and internationally.  Additional factors that could cause SunTrust's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found SunTrust's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and 10-Q/A of SunTrust and NCF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  The forward-looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of the filing, and SunTrust does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
This presentation includes some non-GAAP measures to describe SunTrust's performance.  The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in in the appendix of this presentation, as well as in SunTrust's earnings press release, which can be found on SunTrust's website in the news section of the investor relations pages.

Based on estimated historical combined numbers

SunTrust presents total revenue excluding realized securities gains/losses (and the net gain on sale of RCM assets for 1Q 05);  the Company believes total revenue without securities gains/losses and without the net gain on sale of RCM assets is more indicative of the Company's performance because this isolates income that is primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven

less net unrealized gains on     securities. The foregoing numbers reflect primarily adjustments to remove     the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the     ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.     The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual     performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on     average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative     of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the     return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses     which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven.     The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is     computed by dividing annualized net income, excluding securities     gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, by average assets less net     unrealized securities gains.(2)  The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is     more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded     equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security. The     return on average realized shareholders' equity is computed by dividing     annualized net income, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola     Company dividend, by average realized shareholders' equity.(3)  SunTrust presents total noninterest income and total revenue excluding     realized securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM     assets. The Company believes total noninterest income and total revenue     without securities gains and losses is more indicative of the Company's     performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain is more indicative of normalized operations.(4)  Multiply by 4 to calculate sequential annualized growth or reductions     discussed in the earnings call.

Any sequential annualized change over 100 percent is labeled as "NM". Those     changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.(2)  Includes service charges on deposits, card and other charges and fees.(3)  Includes retail investment services, investment banking income and trading     account profits and commissions.(4)  SunTrust presents noninterest income before securities (losses)/gains and     the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(5)  The Company presents noninterest expense before amortization of intangible     assets and merger expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these     measures provides better comparability and is more reflective of normalized     operations.(6)  SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the     respective categories to conform to the NCF presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.(8)  See Appendix C for the impact of the estimated reclassification adjustments     resulting from the April 22, 2005 NCF systems conversion.

investment banking income and trading     account profits and commissions.(3)  SunTrust presents noninterest income before securities (losses)/gains and     the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(4)  The Company presents noninterest expense before amortization of intangible     assets and merger expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these     measures provides better comparability and is more reflective of normalized     operations.(5)  NCF's FTE adjustments were reduced $4.4 million and $9.1 million from the     second quarter and first six months of 2004, respectively, to conform to     SunTrust's methodology.(6)  SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the     respective categories to conform to the NCF presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.

The Company believes these adjusted measures provide a better     comparison between reporting periods and are more indicative of true loan     and deposit fluctuations. The adjustments represent reclassifications due     to account mapping changes resulting from the systems conversion.(2)  Multiply percentage change by 4 to calculate sequential annualized change.     Any sequential annualized change over 100 percent is labeled as "NM". Those     changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.
