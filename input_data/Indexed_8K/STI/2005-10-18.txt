(NYSE: STI) today reported net income for thethird quarter of 2005 of $510.8 million, as compared to $368.8 million generatedduring the third quarter of 2004. Net income per diluted share was $1.40, up 8%from the third quarter of 2004. Operating net income per diluted share was$1.42, up 9% from the third quarter of 2004. Operating net income does notinclude $7.5 million of after-tax merger charges incurred in the third quarterof 2005 associated with SunTrust's acquisition of National Commerce FinancialCorporation (NCF), which closed on October 1, 2004.     "We're pleased to report another quarter of strong results and, inparticular, positive operating leverage led by especially robust revenue growth.SunTrust's concentrated, corporate-wide sales focus continues to pay off instrong across-the-board loan growth and record mortgage production as wecontinue to tap the opportunities that lie within our high-growth markets," saidL. Phillip Humann, SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Humannalso noted that SunTrust continues to demonstrate consistently effective expensediscipline as indicated by the 3% core expense growth for the first nine monthsof 2005 as compared to the same period of 2004 on an estimated historicalcombined basis. Finally, Mr. Humann said that credit quality trends continue torun better than historical experience although SunTrust reported a modest andentirely predictable uptick in net charge-offs in the third quarter.DISCUSSION OF HISTORICAL RESULTS AND ESTIMATED HISTORICAL COMBINED RESULTS- --------------------------------------------------------------------------     In order to assist investors with comparing the financial results of thenow-combined SunTrust and NCF, estimated historical combined information for thethird quarter and first nine months of 2004 is presented as if the merger hadbeen completed at the beginning of the periods presented. In management's view,the estimated historical combined financial results assist investors in betterunderstanding the comparative performance and underlying growth dynamics of thecombined Company. For further information regarding the estimated historicalcombined financial information, including reconciliations of certain financialinformation, please see Appendix B.     Furthermore, NCF's systems applications were converted to SunTrust'ssystems applications on April 22, 2005. In some cases, NCF classified loans anddeposits differently for financial reporting compared to the SunTrustmethodology. While prior to the conversion NCF loan and deposit accounts weremapped as closely as possible to SunTrust classifications, it was anticipatedthat additional reclassifications could occur once the systems conversions werecompleted. As a result, to better ascertain underlying growth dynamics of thecombined Company, sequential annualized growth rates adjusted for estimatedreclassifications have been provided. In management's view, sequentialannualized growth rates adjusted for estimated reclassifications assistinvestors in better understanding the comparative performance and underlyinggrowth dynamics of loans and deposits for the combined Company. For furtherinformation regarding the consolidated daily average balances for loans anddeposits for the second quarter of 2005, adjusted for estimatedreclassifications that arose as a result of the systems conversions, please seeAppendix C.

The     efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2005 was 58.62%, a 250 basis     point decrease from the third quarter of 2004. The operating efficiency     ratio, which excludes merger expenses, was 58.01%, a 311 basis point     decrease from the operating efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 2004.o    Net charge-offs were 0.27% of average loans, up slightly from 0.24% of     average loans in the third quarter of 2004. The charge-off related to Delta     Airlines represents six basis points of the ratio this quarter.- ----------------(1)  Excludes 3rd quarter 2005 merger related expenses, net of taxes, which     totaled $7.5 million.(2)  Excludes 3rd quarter 2005 merger related expenses, net of taxes, per     diluted share of $0.02.(3)  Excludes 3rd quarter 2005 pretax merger related expenses of $12.1 million     which had the effect of reducing the efficiency ratio by 61 basis points.NR - Not reported.

Total revenue was up 10% from thethird quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. Revenue growthwas driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.     For the first nine months of 2005, total revenue was $5,804.5 million, upfrom $4,488.1 million for the same period in 2004. For the first nine months of2005, total revenue was up 7% from the same period in 2004 on an estimatedhistorical combined basis. Revenue growth for the first nine months of 2005 wasalso driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.NET INTEREST INCOME     Fully taxable net interest income was $1,175.7 million in the third quarterof 2005, up from $893.7 million in the third quarter of 2004. Fully taxable netinterest income was up 8% from the third quarter of 2004 on an estimatedhistorical combined basis. The primary factor driving the net interest incomegrowth year-over-year has been strong loan growth. Loans have grown 13% onaverage from the third quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combinedbasis. The net interest margin of 3.12% for the third quarter of 2005 was downfour basis points from the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to an increasein loans held for sale at a compressed margin. Loans held for sale increased by$1.8 billion on average, or 26%, in the third quarter from the second quarter of2005. Although net interest margin declined in the third quarter of 2005, fullytaxable net interest income increased $33.3 million, or 12%, in the thirdquarter compared to the second quarter of 2005 on a sequential annualized basis.     For the first nine months of 2005, fully taxable net interest income was$3,447.4 million, up from $2,642.7 million for the same period in 2004.

Total noninterest incomefor the third quarter was up 12% from the third quarter of 2004 on an estimatedhistorical combined basis. Comparing the third quarter to the second quarter of2005, total noninterest income excluding securities gains and losses and the netgain on sale of Receivables Capital Management (RCM) factoring assets increased31% on a sequential annualized basis. Drivers of the increase in noninterestincome have been growth in mortgage related income, service charge fee incomeand broker/dealer revenue.     For the first nine months of 2005, noninterest income excluding securitiesgains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM factoring assets was$2,341.5 million, up from $1,867.8 million for the same period in 2004. For thefirst nine months of 2005, noninterest income excluding securities gains andlosses and the net gain on the sale of RCM factoring assets was up 6% from thesame period in 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis.

Total noninterestexpense before affordable housing impairment charges, amortization of intangibleassets and merger expenses was up 3% from the third quarter of 2004 on anestimated historical combined basis. Comparing the third quarter to the secondquarter of 2005, total noninterest expense before affordable housing impairmentcharges, amortization of intangible assets and merger expenses increased 8% on asequential annualized basis.

Cost savings from the merger integration amounted to $36 million in thethird quarter of 2005, bringing the total cost savings to $62 million for thefirst nine months of 2005.     Positive operating leverage drove improvement in the Company's efficiencyratio measures. The reported efficiency ratio was 58.62% for the third quarterof 2005 compared to 61.30% for the second quarter of 2005. The operatingefficiency ratio, which excludes the impact of merger expenses, was 58.01%. Thiscompares favorably to the second quarter operating efficiency ratio of 58.46%.     For the first nine months of 2005, total noninterest expense was $3,483.8million, up from $2,748.0 million for the same period of 2004.

Equitycapital of $16.7 billion represented 10% of total assets. Book value per sharewas $46.28, up from $45.96 on June 30, 2005.LOANS     Average loans for the third quarter of 2005 were $110.8 billion, up from$83.8 billion for the third quarter of 2004. Average loans were up 13% from thethird quarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. On a sequentialannualized basis, average loans grew 14% from the second quarter to the thirdquarter of 2005. Areas of strongest growth in the consumer category wereresidential real estate, home equity and consumer direct. In the commercialcategory, loan growth was strong across all segments except for real estate.DEPOSITS     Average consumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter of 2005 were$94.1 billion, up from $74.1 billion for the third quarter of 2004. Averageconsumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter were up 7% from the thirdquarter of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. On a sequentialannualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 4% from thesecond quarter to the third quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basisadjusted for estimated reclassifications, money market and time deposit growthwas particularly strong in the third quarter.ASSET QUALITY- -------------     Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2005 were 0.27% of average loans,up from 0.13% of average loans in the second quarter of 2005 and 0.24% ofaverage loans in the third quarter of 2004. Net charge-offs were $76.7 millionin the third quarter of 2005 compared to $35.4 million in the second quarter of2005. Included in net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2005 was a $17.4million charge-off related to Delta Airlines, which represented six basis pointsof the net charge-off to average loans ratio. SunTrust had fully reserved itscredit exposure to Delta Airlines in prior periods; consequently no additionalprovision expense was recognized at the time of charge-off. Nonperforming assetsdecreased from $380.3 million or 0.35% of loans, other real estate owned andother repossessed assets at June 30, 2005 to $362.7 million or 0.32% of loans,other real estate owned and other repossessed assets at September 30, 2005.
The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased to $1,029.9 million atSeptember 30, 2005 from $1,036.2 million at June 30, 2005. The allowancedeclined by $6.3 million due in part to the effect of the Delta Airlinescharge-off. Excluding the effect of the Delta Airlines charge-off, the allowancefor loan and lease losses would have increased by $11.1 million as a result ofthe Company's continued strong loan growth. Provision expense increased from$47.8 million in the second quarter of 2005 to $70.4 million in the thirdquarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses at September 30, 2005represented 0.92% of loans and 312.4% of nonperforming loans.

ratios are presented on a fully     taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored     status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes     this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest     income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable     amounts.(3)  Current period tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are     estimated as of the press release date.

The foregoing numbers reflect primarily adjustments to remove     the effects of the Company's securities portfolio which includes the     ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company.     The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual     performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on     average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative     of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the     return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses     which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven.     The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is     computed by dividing annualized net income, excluding securities     gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, by average assets less net     unrealized securities gains.(2)  The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is     more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded     equity relates primarily to a long term holding of a specific security. The     return on average realized shareholders' equity is computed by dividing     annualized net income, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola     Company dividend, by average realized shareholders' equity.(3)  SunTrust presents total noninterest income and total revenue excluding     realized securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM     assets. The Company believes total noninterest income and total revenue     without securities gains and losses is more indicative of the Company's     performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain is more indicative of normalized operations.(4)  Multiply by 4 to calculate sequential annualized growth or reductions     discussed in the earnings call.

Any sequential annualized change over 100 percent is labeled as "NM". Those     changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.(2)  Includes service charges on deposits, card and other charges and fees.(3)  Includes retail investment services, investment banking income and trading     account profits and commissions.(4)  SunTrust presents noninterest income before securities (losses)/gains and     the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(5)  The Company presents noninterest expense before an impairment charge on     Affordable Housing Properties, amortization of intangible assets and merger     expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these measures provides     better comparability and is more reflective of normalized operations.(6)  SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured loans are included in the     respective categories to conform to the NCF presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.(8)  See Appendix C for the impact of the estimated reclassification adjustments     resulting from the April 22, 2005 NCF systems conversion.

noninterest income before securities (losses)/gains and     the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes noninterest     income before securities gains and losses is more indicative of the     Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer     relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the     net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the     exclusion of the net gain provides better comparability and is more     indicative of normalized operations.(4)  The Company presents noninterest expense before an impairment charge on     Affordable Housing Properties, amortization of intangible assets and merger     expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these measures provides     better comparability and is more reflective of normalized operations.(5)  NCF's FTE adjustments were reduced $4.0 million and $13.1 million from the     third quarter and first nine months of 2004, respectively, to conform to     SunTrust's methodology. (6)SunTrust's average nonaccrual and restructured     loans are included in the respective categories to conform to the NCF     presentation.(7)  Includes consumer direct and consumer indirect loans.

The Company believes these adjusted measures provide a better     comparison between reporting periods and are more indicative of true loan     and deposit fluctuations. The adjustments represent reclassifications due     to account mapping changes resulting from the systems conversion.(2)  Multiply percentage change by 4 to calculate sequential annualized change.
