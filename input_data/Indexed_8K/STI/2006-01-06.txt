Item 1.01    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 30, 2005, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Registrant") amended its ERISA Excess Retirement Plan to increase the maximum amount of compensation that can be used to calculate the benefit for a participant whose compensation is restricted. The ERISA Excess Retirement Plan provides certain key executives of the Registrant retirement benefits not provided under the Registrant's qualified Retirement Plan because of governmental limits on pension benefits. Pursuant to the amendment, the maximum amount of compensation that can be used to calculate the benefit for a participant whose compensation is restricted increased from $300,000 to two times the annual compensation limit for qualified plans under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference.
On December 30, 2005, the Registrant entered into the Sixth Amendment to its 401(k) Excess Plan, which is a non-qualified plan that provides unfunded defined contribution plan benefits to certain management employees not otherwise permitted to be provided under the Registrant's qualified 401(k) plan because of governmental limits on contributions and benefits. Pursuant to the amendment, the limit on the amount of compensation that can be used to calculate benefits under the plan will increase from $300,000 to two times the annual compensation limit for qualified plans under section 401(a)(17) of the Code. In addition, the amendment changes the definition of compensation to include non-deferred payments from the Registrant's Management Incentive Plan as part of the deferral base. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Sixth Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated by reference.
