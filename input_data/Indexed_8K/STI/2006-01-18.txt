For Immediate Release
SunTrust Reports Fourth Quarter and Full  Year 2005 Earnings
Company Wraps Up Year of Strong Growth
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 of $513.8 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income per diluted share was $1.41, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income per diluted share excluding merger expense was $1.43, up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income excluding merger expense excludes $4.1 million of after-tax merger charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 associated with SunTrusts acquisition of National Commerce Financial Corporation (NCF), which closed on October 1, 2004. For the full year 2005, the Company reported net income of $1,982.6 million, up from $1,572.9 million earned in the same period in 2004. Net income per diluted share was $5.45, up from $5.19 earned in the same period in 2004. Net income per diluted share excluding merger expense was $5.62 for the full year 2005, up 7% from the same period in 2004, despite the dilution effect from the NCF merger.
Were pleased to report that the Company ended the year with another quarter of solid results, in particular net income and EPS growth. The performance-oriented business strategies we have been implementing over the past year continued to translate into significant loan and solid deposit growth. These strategies helped drive strong year-over-year revenue expansion that, coupled with continued effectiveness in expense control, resulted in positive operating leverage for 2005, L. Phillip Humann, chairman and CEO of SunTrust noted. Revenue growth was 7% while core expense growth was only 4% for 2005 on an estimated historical combined basis. Mr. Humann also noted that credit quality trends continue to run better than historical experience and actually improved during the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, with improvements experienced in key credit measures such as net charge-offs and nonperforming assets.
Discussion of Historical Results and Estimated Historical Combined Results
In order to assist investors with comparing the financial results of the now-combined SunTrust and NCF, estimated historical combined information for the full year of 2004 is presented as if the merger had been completed at the beginning of the period presented. In managements view, the estimated historical combined financial results assist investors in better understanding the comparative performance and underlying growth dynamics of the combined Company. For further information regarding the estimated historical combined financial information, including reconciliations of certain financial information, please see Appendix B. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2004 and forward are presented on an actual historical basis as the acquisition of NCF was completed on October 1, 2004.
Fourth Quarter 2005 Summary:
    
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Total revenue was $1,997.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2004. Revenue growth was driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.
For the full year 2005, total revenue was $7,802.0 million, up from $6,348.0 million for the same period in 2004. Total revenue was up 7% from the full year 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis. Revenue growth for the full year 2005 was also driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable net interest income was $1,207.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2004. The primary factor driving the net interest income growth year-over-year has been strong loan growth. Loans have grown 14% on average from the fourth quarter of 2004. The net interest margin of 3.10% for the fourth quarter of 2005 was down two basis points from the third quarter of 2005 primarily due to an increase in loans held for sale at a compressed margin. Loans held for sale increased by $3.4 billion on average, or 40%, in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of 2005, driven mainly by record mortgage volume from the third quarter. Although the net interest margin declined in the fourth quarter of 2005, fully taxable net interest income increased $31.3 million, or 11%, in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2005 on a sequential annualized basis.
For the full year 2005, fully taxable net interest income was $4,654.5 million, up from $3,743.6 million for the same period in 2004. For the full year 2005, fully taxable net interest income was up 7% from the same period in 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $790.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in noninterest income resulted from growth in mortgage related income, trust and investment management income and card fees.
For the full year 2005, noninterest income was $3,147.6 million, up from $2,604.4 million for the same period in 2004. For the full year 2005, noninterest income was up 6% from the same period in 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis, with the drivers being the same as noted for the fourth quarter increase.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $1,206.9 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2004. Total noninterest expense before Affordable Housing impairment charges, amortization of intangible assets and merger expense was up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2004.
For the full year 2005, total noninterest expense was $4,690.7 million, up from $3,897.0 million for the same period of 2004. Total noninterest expense before Affordable Housing impairment charges, amortization of intangible assets and merger expense was up 4% for the full year 2005 from the same period of 2004 on an estimated historical combined basis, demonstrating overall effective cost control and the realization of cost savings related to the NCF merger. The cost savings related to the NCF merger totaled $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, bringing the total cost savings to $98 million for 2005, which exceeded the original estimate of $76 million by 28%.
The revenue growth noted earlier, coupled with the successful cost controls in 2005, led to positive operating leverage and improvement in the Companys efficiency ratio measures. The reported efficiency ratio was 60.42% for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 61.78% for the fourth quarter of 2004, an improvement of 136 basis points. The efficiency ratio excluding merger expense was 60.09% which compares favorably to the fourth quarter 2004 efficiency ratio excluding merger expense of 60.25%.
Balance Sheet
At December 31, 2005, SunTrust had total assets of $179.7 billion. Shareholders equity of $16.9 billion represented 9% of total assets. Book value per share was $46.64, up from $46.28 as of September 30, 2005.
Loans
Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $113.8 billion, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2004. On a sequential annualized basis, average loans grew 11% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2005. Areas of strongest growth in consumer lending were residential real estate and home equity. In commercial lending, loan growth was moderate to strong across most categories.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $95.3 billion, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2004. On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 5% from the third quarter of 2005. Time deposit growth was particularly strong in the fourth quarter, followed by growth in NOW and DDA accounts.
Asset Quality
Several key asset quality measures improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2005, resulting in improvement in measures the Company already believes compare very favorably with published industry averages.
Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2005 were 0.17% of average loans, down from 0.27% of average loans in the third quarter of 2005, and 0.21% of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net charge-offs were $49.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $76.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets decreased from $362.7 million, or 0.32% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets at September 30, 2005 to $334.2 million, or 0.29% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets at December 31, 2005.
The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased slightly to $1,028.1 million at December 31, 2005 from $1,029.9 million at September 30, 2005. Provision expense decreased from $70.4 million in the third quarter of 2005 to $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2005 represented 0.90% of loans, a slight decrease from 0.92% at September 30, 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2005 represented 346.9% of nonperforming loans, an increase from 312.4% at September 30, 2005.
