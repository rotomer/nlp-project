This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the merger between SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust") and National Commerce Financial Corporation ("NCF"), including future financial and operating results, SunTrust's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.  Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of SunTrust's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients, employees or suppliers; increased competition and its effects on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; the risk of new and changing regulation in the U.S. and internationally.  Additional factors that could cause SunTrust's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in SunTrust's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and 10-Q/A of SunTrust and NCF filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  The forward-looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of the filing, and SunTrust does not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
This presentation includes some non-GAAP measures to describe SunTrust's performance.  The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation, as well as in SunTrust's earnings press releases, which can be found on SunTrust's website in the news section of the investor relations pages.
