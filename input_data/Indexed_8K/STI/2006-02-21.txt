Item 1.01    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust" or the "Registrant") entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Thomas E. Freeman, SunTrust's Corporate Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, effective as of February 17, 2006 (the "Agreement"). The Agreement is for a base term of three years, and will be automatically extended for one year terms unless either SunTrust or Mr. Freeman provide notice to the contrary.
The Agreement provides, among other things, that if a Change in Control (as defined therein) occurs during the term of the Agreement and (i) SunTrust terminates Mr. Freeman's employment without Cause (as defined therein) during the term of the Agreement or (ii) Mr. Freeman resigns for Good Reason (as defined therein) during such term, then, among other things, (1) SunTrust will pay Mr. Freeman two times his then-current salary and bonus (under certain SunTrust bonus plans) in cash in a lump sum within 30 days after the date Mr. Freeman's employment so terminates, (2) each outstanding stock option granted to Mr. Freeman by SunTrust will immediately become fully vested and exercisable on the date Mr. Freeman's employment so terminates and Mr. Freeman shall be deemed to continue to be employed by SunTrust for the two year period following the date of the Change in Control for purposes of determining when Mr. Freeman's right to exercise each such option expires notwithstanding the terms of any plan or agreement under which such option was granted, (3) any restrictions on any outstanding restricted or performance stock grants to Mr. Freeman by SunTrust will immediately expire and Mr. Freeman's right to such stock will be non-forfeitable notwithstanding the terms of any plan or agreement under which such grants were made, (4) Mr. Freeman will be eligible, under certain circumstances, to be paid a bonus based on the projected bonus to which Mr. Freeman would have otherwise been entitled under certain SunTrust bonus plans, and (5) following the date of such termination of employment until the date that is two years following the date of the Change in Control, SunTrust will provide to Mr. Freeman medical, dental and life insurance benefits which are similar in all material respects as those benefits provided under SunTrust's employee benefit plans, policies and programs to senior executives of SunTrust who have not terminated their employment.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Change in Control Agreement, a copy of which is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.

Each outstanding stock option granted to Executive by SunTrust shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable on the date Executive's employment so terminates and Executive shall be deemed to continue to be employed by SunTrust for the period described in  3(d) for purposes of determining when Executive's right to exercise each such option expires notwithstanding the terms of any plan or agreement under which such option was granted.
(C)    Restricted Stock.     Any restrictions on any outstanding restricted or performance stock grants to Executive by SunTrust shall immediately expire and Executive's right to such stock shall be non-forfeitable notwithstanding the terms of any plan or agreement under which such grants were made.

SunTrust shall promptly pay Executive any earned but unpaid base salary and bonus, shall promptly pay Executive for any earned but untaken vacation and shall promptly reimburse Executive for any incurred but unreimbursed expenses which are otherwise reimbursable under SunTrust's expense reimbursement policy as in effect for senior executives immediately before Executive's employment so terminates.
(E)    MIP or MIP Alternative.    
(1)    General Rule.     If Executive participates in the MIP or in an alternative, functional incentive plan, SunTrust shall (subject to the exception to this general rule set forth in  3(a)(2)(E)(2)) pay Executive within 30 days after Executive's employment terminates a portion of Executive's target bonus or, if greater, Executive's projected bonus under the MIP or such alternative, functional incentive plan for the calendar year in which Executive's employment terminates, where (a) Executive's projected bonus shall be no less than the bonus which would have been projected under the projection procedures in effect under the MIP or such alternative, functional incentive plan on the date of the Change in Control and (b) such portion shall be determined by multiplying such target bonus or, if greater, such projected bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days Executive is employed in such calendar year and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in such calendar year.
(2)    Exceptions to General Rule.    
(a)    No MIP.     If Executive participates in an alternative, functional incentive plan and in the PUP but not in the MIP, the payment made to Executive under
6
 3(a)(2)(E)(1) shall not exceed the payment which would have been made to Executive if Executive instead had been a participant in the MIP.
(b)    No MIP and No PUP.     If Executive participates in an alternative, functional incentive plan but does not participate in either the MIP or the PUP, the payment made to Executive under  3(a)(2)(E)(1) shall not exceed the payment which would have been made to Executive if Executive instead had been a participant in the MIP and in the PUP.
(c)    Determination Rules.     SunTrust shall determine the payment which would have been made to Executive under  3(a)(E)(1) if Executive had been a participant in the MIP and, if applicable, under  3(a)(F) if Executive had been a participant in the PUP based on the target bonus or, if greater, the projected bonus for a MIP participant and the target bonus or, if greater, the projected bonus for PUP participant, or for a class of such participants, whose duties, responsibilities and compensation match, or most closely match, Executive's duties, responsibilities and compensation before a Change in Control.

If Executive participates in the PUP, SunTrust shall pay Executive within 30 days after Executive's employment terminates a portion of Executive's target bonus or, if greater, Executive's projected bonus under the PUP for each performance cycle in effect on the date Executive's employment terminates, where (1) Executive's projected bonus shall be no less than the bonus which would have been projected under the projection procedures in effect under the PUP on the date of the Change in Control and (2) such portion shall be determined by multiplying such target bonus or, if greater, such projected bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days Executive is employed in each such performance cycle and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in each such performance cycle.
(b)    Continuing Benefit Coverage.    If Executive's employment terminates under the circumstances described in  3(a) or  3(f), SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate from the date of such termination of Executive's employment until the end of Executive's Protection Period shall provide to Executive medical, dental and life insurance benefits which are similar in all material respects as those benefits provided under SunTrust's employee benefit plans, policies and programs to senior executives of SunTrust who have not terminated their employment. If SunTrust cannot provide such benefits under SunTrust's employee benefit plans, policies and programs, SunTrust either shall provide such benefits to Executive outside such plans, policies and programs at no additional expense or tax liability to Executive or shall reimburse Executive for Executive's cost to purchase such benefits and for any tax liability for such reimbursements.
(c)    No Interference with Vested Benefits.    If Executive's employment terminates under the circumstances described in  3(a) or  3(f), Executive shall have a right to any benefits under any employee benefit plan, policy or program maintained by SunTrust or any SunTrust Affiliate (other than the MIP, the PUP and the SunTrust Severance Pay Plan) which Executive had a right to receive under the terms of such employee benefit plan, policy or program after a termination of Executive's employment without regard to this Agreement.
(d)    Additional Age and Service Credit.    If Executive's employment terminates under the circumstances described in  3(a) or  3(f), Executive shall be deemed to have been employed by SunTrust throughout Executive's Protection Period for purposes of computing Executive's age and service credit on the date Executive's employment so terminates under any deferred compensation or welfare plan, policy or program (except a plan described in  401 of the Code) maintained by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate in which Executive is a participant and under which Executive's benefit, or eligibility for a benefit, is based in whole or in part on Executive's age or service or age and service, and Executive shall receive such age and service credit notwithstanding the terms of any such plan, policy or program.
(e)    No Increase in Other Benefits; No Other Severance Pay.    If Executive's employment terminates under the circumstances described in  3(a) or  3(f), Executive waives Executive's
7
right, if any, to have any payment made under this  3 taken into account to increase the benefits otherwise payable to, or on behalf of, Executive under any employee benefit plan, policy or program, whether qualified or nonqualified, maintained by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate and, further, waives Executive's right, if any, to the payment of severance pay and severance benefits under any severance pay plan, policy or program maintained by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate or under any individual severance agreement or employment agreement, subject to the condition that SunTrust not be relieved of any of its obligations to Executive under this  3 pursuant to  3(g) or  3(h).
(f)    Termination in Anticipation of Change in Control.    Executive shall be treated under  3(a) as if Executive's employment had been terminated without Cause or Executive had resigned for Good Reason during Executive's Protection Period if (1)(A) Executive's employment is terminated by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate without Cause on or after the date the shareholders of SunTrust approve any transaction described in 1.3(iii) or 1.3(iv) but before the Change in Control which results from such approval or (B) Executive resigns for Good Reason on or after the date the shareholders of SunTrust approve any transaction described in 1.3(iii) or 1.3(iv) but before the Change in Control which results from such approval, (2) such shareholder approval occurs on or after the date this Agreement becomes effective under  2 and (3) there is a Change in Control which results from such shareholder approval.

(h)    Release.    Executive agrees that SunTrust will have no obligations to Executive under this  3 until Executive executes the form of release which is attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement and, further, will have no further obligations to Executive under this  3 if Executive revokes such release.
 4.
No Solicitation of Customers or Clients
Executive shall not during the Restricted Period solicit any customer or client of SunTrust or any SunTrust Affiliate with whom Executive had any material business contact during the two (2) year period which ends on the date Executive's employment by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate terminates for the purpose of competing with SunTrust or any SunTrust Affiliate for any reason, either individually, or as an owner, partner, employee, agent, consultant, advisor, contractor, salesman, stockholder, investor, officer or director of, or service provider to, any corporation, partnership, venture or other business entity.

Tax Protection
If SunTrust or SunTrust's independent accountants determine that any payments and benefits called for under this Agreement together with any other payments and benefits made available to Executive by SunTrust or a SunTrust Affiliate will result in Executive being subject to an excise tax under  4999 of the Code or if such an excise tax is assessed against Executive as a result of any such payments and other benefits, SunTrust shall make a Gross Up Payment to or on behalf of Executive as and when any such determination or assessment is made, provided Executive takes such action (other than waiving Executive's right to any payments or benefits) as SunTrust reasonably requests under the circumstances to mitigate or challenge such tax. Any determination under this  9 by SunTrust or SunTrust's independent accountants shall be made in accordance with  280G of the Code and any applicable related regulations (whether proposed, temporary or final) and any related Internal
9
Revenue Service rulings and any related case law and, if SunTrust reasonably requests that Executive take action to mitigate or challenge, or to mitigate and challenge, any such tax or assessment (other than waiving Executive's right to any payment or benefit) and Executive complies with such request, SunTrust shall provide Executive with such information and such expert advice and assistance from SunTrust's independent accountants, lawyers and other advisors as Executive may reasonably request and shall pay for all expenses incurred in effecting such compliance and any related fines, penalties, interest and other assessments.
