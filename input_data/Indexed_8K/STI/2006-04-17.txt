News Release
April 17, 2006
For Immediate Release
SunTrust Reports Record First Quarter 2006 Earnings
Companys Strong Growth Trends Continue in the New Year
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported record net income for the first quarter of 2006 of $531.5 million, up 8% from $492.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. Net income per diluted share was also a record $1.46, up 7% from $1.36 in the first quarter of 2005.
Our first quarter results are evidence that we continue to build on the strong operating platform that we have established. We are pleased to report that the Company started out the new year with record results in net income and earnings per share despite a challenging environment. The continued execution of our business strategies across all lines of business drove another quarter of significant loan and revenue growth. This growth, coupled with continued improvement in credit quality, resulted in the strong earnings that we posted for the first quarter, L. Phillip Humann, chairman and CEO of SunTrust noted. Revenue growth was 9%, and excluding the net gain on sale of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005 and securities gains and losses, revenue growth was 10% over the first quarter of 2005. Loan growth was 13% over this same time frame. Mr. Humann noted that credit quality trends continued to improve from the already low historical levels experienced over the past year, with key credit measures such as net charge-offs and nonperforming loans to total loans falling to cyclical lows in the first quarter of 2006.
First Quarter 2006 Consolidated Highlights
1
First Quarter 2006 Consolidated Highlights, continued
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,050.9 million for the first quarter of 2006, up 9% from the first quarter of 2005. Fully taxable-equivalent revenue, excluding securities gains and losses and the net gain on sale of factoring assets that occurred in the first quarter of 2005, increased 10% from the first quarter of 2005. Fully taxable-equivalent revenue growth was driven by strong increases in both fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income. On a sequential annualized basis, fully-taxable-equivalent revenue increased 9% in the first quarter of 2006 from the fourth quarter of 2005.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,199.4 million in the first quarter of 2006, up 6% from the first quarter of 2005. The primary factor driving the fully taxable-equivalent net interest income growth year-over-year was strong loan growth. Loans grew 13% on average from the first quarter of 2005. The net interest margin of 3.10% for the first quarter of 2006 was unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2005.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $851.5 million for the first quarter of 2006, up a strong 13% from the first quarter of 2005. Excluding securities gains and losses and the net gain on sale of factoring assets recorded in the first quarter of 2005, total noninterest income grew 15%. A significant portion of the increase resulted from growth in mortgage related income, reflecting the continued strength in loan production-related income as well as an increase in mortgage servicing-related income. An increase in the level of loan sales as well as our continued sales efforts drove the increase in production-related income in the first quarter. The increase in servicing-related income experienced during the first quarter is an indication of the increased income created from the larger servicing portfolio, a reduction in the mortgage servicing amortization rate and the realization of the value embedded in the excess mortgage servicing rights through the securitization and subsequent sale of a portion of the excess servicing rights. Additionally, growth in card fees, investment banking income, trust and investment management income and service charges also contributed. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest income increased 27% in the first quarter of 2006 from the fourth quarter of 2005, largely driven by the increase in mortgage-related income in the first quarter.
2
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2006 was $1,226.5 million, up 8% from the first quarter of 2005. The increase in expense reflects certain investments in revenue producing divisions of the Company, including the addition of offices and employees and investment in the infrastructure of the organization to gain greater efficiencies in the future. The increase in marketing and customer development expense reflects the Companys focus on customer acquisition. Offsetting these increases was the lack of merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2006. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest expense increased 6% in the first quarter of 2006 from the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the merger-related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2005 from total noninterest expense, the increase was 9%. The respective increases of 6% and 9% were mainly attributable to increases in certain employee benefit expenses that are seasonal, such as FICA expense.
The reported efficiency ratio was 59.80% for the first quarter of 2006 compared to 60.20% for the fourth quarter of 2005, an improvement of 40 basis points. Excluding the effect of merger-related expenses included in the fourth quarter of 2005, the efficiency ratio for that quarter was 59.87% and the improvement was 7 basis points.
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2006, SunTrust had total assets of $178.9 billion. Shareholders equity of $17.2 billion as of March 31, 2006 represented 10% of total assets. Book value per share was $47.22 as of March 31, 2006, up from $46.65 as of December 31, 2005.
Loans
Average loans for the first quarter of 2006 were $116.3 billion, up 13% from the first quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, average loans grew 9% in the first quarter of 2006 from the fourth quarter of 2005. Areas of strongest growth in consumer lending were residential real estate and home equity lines. Although reported commercial loans grew 1%, the sequential annualized rate of growth excluding the impact of shorter-term corporate lending facilities, which are temporary and can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, was 9% in the first quarter of 2006 from the fourth quarter of 2005. Real estate construction also contributed to the overall loan growth.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter of 2006 were $95.3 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of 2005. The growth in deposits was driven mainly by growth in money market accounts and certificates of deposit. On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Seasonal declines in noninterest bearing, NOW and savings deposits, as well as the expected seasonal decline in mortgage escrow balances, were offset by strong certificate of deposit growth. Given market conditions and the higher rate environment, customer preference is for higher-yielding deposit products, which is reflected in the deposit mix shift from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The Company continues to pursue deposit growth initiatives aimed at product promotions, as well as increasing our presence in specific markets within our footprint.
Asset Quality
The Company reached cyclical lows in several key credit measures in the first quarter of 2006 from the already exceptionally good levels in prior quarters. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2006 were 0.08% of average loans, down from 0.17% of average loans in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 0.14% of average loans in the first quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $22.3 million in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $49.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $36.8 million in the first quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets were relatively stable in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005, and were down $58.0 million, or 15%, from the first quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets were $334.3 million, or 0.28% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of March 31, 2006 compared to $334.2 million, or 0.29% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of December 31, 2005.
3
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11.1 million to $1,039.2 million as of March 31, 2006 from $1,028.1 million as of December 31, 2005 due to strong loan growth during the period. Provision expense decreased from $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to $33.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of March 31, 2006 represented 0.88% of period-end loans, a slight decrease from 0.90% as of December 31, 2005. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of March 31, 2006 represented 358.7% of period-end nonperforming loans, an increase from 346.9% as of December 31, 2005.
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Retail
Retails net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $190.5 million, an increase of $48.9 million, or 35%, compared to the first quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily the result of higher fully taxable-equivalent net interest income, lower net charge-offs and higher noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $71.0 million, or 14%, from the first quarter of 2005. The increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 6%, and average deposits increased $3.6 billion, or 6% from the first quarter of 2005. The loan growth was driven primarily by home equity lines, while the deposit growth was driven by certificates of deposit.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $12.9 million, or 40%, from the first quarter of 2005 primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $20.4 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes, gains on sales of student loans and service charges on deposit accounts.
Total noninterest expense increased $29.2 million, or 6%, from the first quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by increases in personnel expense and operation costs related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology.
Commercial
Commercials net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $106.8 million, an increase of $15.2 million, or 17%, compared to the first quarter of 2005. The increase was driven by higher fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $22.5 million, or 11%, from the first quarter of 2005. The increase is attributable to increased loan volumes and deposit spreads. Average loans
4
increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, from the first quarter of 2005 with the strongest growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $449.1 million, or 3%, from the first quarter of 2005 driven by an increase in public funds and partially offset by a decrease in demand deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, improved from a net recovery position of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2005 to a net recovery position of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income increased $10.8 million, or 19%, from the first quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily driven by increases in Affordable Housing revenue, sweep income and letter of credit fees.
Total noninterest expense increased $12.4 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2005. Investment in personnel and higher Affordable Housing expenses were the primary drivers.
Corporate and Investment Banking
Corporate and Investment Bankings net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $64.2 million, a decrease of $8.3 million, or 12%, compared to the first quarter of 2005. Growth in fully taxable-equivalent net interest and capital markets income in the first quarter of 2006 was offset by the divestiture of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusting net income and fully taxable-equivalent revenue for the impact from the March 2005 divestiture of factoring assets, net income increased 11%, and fully taxable-equivalent revenue increased 8% from the first quarter of 2005.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $8.3 million, or 14%, from the first quarter of 2005. Average loans and leases increased $2.2 billion, or 16%, from the first quarter of 2005. Average deposits increased $559.7 million, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2005. Loan growth is due to increased corporate demand and merger and acquisition activity. Corporate demand for long-term CDs drove deposit growth.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, declined from a net recovery position of $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2005 to a net recovery position of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income decreased $19.4 million, or 11%, from the first quarter of 2005 primarily driven by the divestiture of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005. Also contributing to the decrease was weakness in merger and acquisition related fees and fixed income trading. This was partially offset by revenue growth related to securitizations, derivatives and syndicated loans.
Total noninterest expense increased $2.3 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2005. The majority of this change was due to increased compensation as a direct result of capital markets revenue growth. This was partially offset by the expense reduction from the factoring asset divestiture.
5
Mortgage
Mortgages net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $79.7 million, an increase of $41.5 million, or 109%, compared to the first quarter of 2005. Record loan sales to investors, gains from the securitization and sale of excess mortgage servicing rights and increased volumes drove the increase.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $23.0 million, or 18%, from the first quarter of 2005. Total average loans increased $6.9 billion, or 32%, from the first quarter of 2005 due to strong construction-permanent production and continued demand for portfolio loan products. The higher loan balances contributed $22.3 million to the increase in net interest income. Loans held for sale increased $3.3 billion, or 58%, to $9.1 billion from the first quarter of 2005. However, due to compressed spreads, income from loans held for sale decreased $3.5 million, or 8%, from the first quarter of 2005. Average deposits were up $145.6 million, or 11%, from the first quarter of 2005 due to increased escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances. The higher deposit balances combined with the benefit in a higher rate environment from this funding contributed an additional $4.6 million to net interest income.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $1.7 million to $2.8 million from the first quarter of 2005, which was less than 0.01% of total average loans for the first quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income was up $75.5 million, or 169%, from the first quarter of 2005. Production income increased $43.8 million, or 219%, from the first quarter of 2005 principally due to higher loan sales to investors. Loan sales were up $4.9 billion, or 92%, from the first quarter of 2005 to a record level of $10.3 billion. Increased loan production also contributed to higher noninterest income. Loan production was $11.6 billion, up $2.9 billion, or 34%, from the first quarter of 2005. Servicing income increased $32.3 million, or 274% compared with last year. The securitization and subsequent sale of excess mortgage servicing rights related to $12.8 billion in servicing balances resulted in income of $24.4 million. Additionally, fee income increased due to higher servicing balances. Total loans serviced as of March 31, 2006 were $112.2 billion compared to $83.6 billion as of March 31, 2005, an increase of $28.5 billion or 34%.
Total noninterest expense increased by $31.3 million, or 28%, from the first quarter of 2005. Increased volume and growth-related costs were the primary drivers of the higher expense.
Wealth and Investment Management
Wealth and Investment Managements net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $45.7 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 7%, compared to the first quarter of 2005. The growth was primarily driven by increased net interest income, partially offset by expenses related to the continued build-out of the business.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $15.0 million, or 19%, from the first quarter of 2005 attributable to increased loan volume and deposit spreads. Average loans increased
6
$574.7 million, or 8%, from the first quarter of 2005 driven by strong consumer mortgage, equity line and commercial real estate demand, partially offset by a decline in consumer direct installment loans. Average deposits decreased $186.4 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2005.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $0.1 million from the first quarter of 2005.
Total noninterest income increased $6.1 million, or 3%, from the first quarter of 2005 due to growth in trust income which resulted from higher assets under management. Assets under management increased approximately $7.8 billion, or 6%, from last year due to new business and an increase in equity market valuations. End of period assets under management were approximately $136.9 billion compared to $129.1 billion in the same period last year. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrusts total assets under advisement were approximately $245.4 billion, which include $136.9 billion in assets under management, $45.5 billion in non-managed trust assets, $35.0 billion in retail brokerage assets and $28.0 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.
Total noninterest expense increased $16.6 million, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2005. The growth was primarily driven by increased expenses paid to third parties, increased operations costs, and continued investments in the business.
Corporate Other and Treasury
Corporate Other and Treasurys net income for the first quarter of 2006 was $44.8 million, a decrease of $61.0 million, or 58%, compared to the same period in 2005 mainly due to a decrease in net interest income.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $69.7 million, or 52%, from the first quarter of 2005. The main drivers for the reduction in net interest income were a $2.3 billion decrease in securities available for sale, a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio, and an increase in short-term borrowing costs due to an increase in the size of these borrowings needed to fund earning asset growth, as well as a significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
Total average deposits increased $11.0 billion, or 80%, from last year mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits of $11.2 billion. Additionally, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt declined $2.5 billion from the first quarter of 2005.
Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $34.5 million from the first quarter of 2005.
Total noninterest income increased $4.2 million, or 76%, from the first quarter of 2005. This was mainly due to net securities gains of $0.1 million in the first of 2006 compared to net securities losses of $6.4 million in the same period of 2005.
Total noninterest expense increased $0.8 million, or 6%, from the first quarter of 2005.
