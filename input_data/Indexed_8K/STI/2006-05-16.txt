The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes and other information contained in the Company's Quarterly Report for the period ended March 31, 2006 on Form 10-Q and the 2005 Annual Report found on Form 10-K.
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrust's performance.  The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation, as well as in SunTrust's earnings press releases, which can be found on SunTrust's website in the news section of the investor relations pages.  In this presentation, net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis, and ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.
This presentation contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which involve significant risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words "intends," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates," or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as "will," "should," "would," and "could." Actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by such statements for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to: changes in interest rates; changes in general business or economic conditions or the competitive banking environment; increases in the  cost of funds resulting from customers pursuing alternatives to bank deposits or shifting from demand deposits to higher-cost products; significant changes in legislation or regulatory requirements, or the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies; significant changes in securities markets or markets for commercial or residential real estate; hurricanes and other natural disasters; litigation; and changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines. These factors and others are described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors," as supplemented by the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.   The forward looking statements in this presentation speak only as of the date of this presentation, and SunTrust does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statement is made.

Strong noninterest income growth was mainly driven by an increase in mortgage related income. This included a $24 million gain on the sale of excess servicing rights, which is consistent with our balanced approach to the mortgage line of business. We anticipate $10-$20 million in MSR gains per quarter for the next two quarters.
