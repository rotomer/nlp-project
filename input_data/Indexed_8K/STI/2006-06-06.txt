The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes and other information contained in the Company's Quarterly Report for the period ended March 31, 2006 on Form 10-Q and the 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrust's performance. The reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation, as well as in SunTrust's earnings press releases, which can be found on SunTrust's website in the news section of the investor relations pages. In this presentation, net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis, and ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

Viewpointe currently is the largest provider of a check image archive, processing millions of items each month

Viewpointe currently is the largest provider of a check image archive, processing millions of items each month

Strategy Highlights:
Strategy Highlights:
Retain Servicing associated with 90%+ of originated volume
Retain "Portfolio" production as held for investment: Hybrid (i.e. 3/1, 5/1, 7/1) ARMs, closed-end second lien mortgages, and construction-permanent loans
Sell whole loans servicing released for products which do not fit our risk profile
Use natural hedge of servicing and the mortgage portfolio to offset the cyclicality of loan origination business
Balanced Business Strategy
Balanced Business Strategy
MSR Amortization increases due to faster prepayment, which decreases servicing income
MSR Amortization increases due to faster prepayment, which decreases servicing income
In a falling rate environment new production at higher margins offsets greater servicing asset amortization
Balanced Business Strategy
Slower prepayment speeds result in lower mortgage servicing rights amortization
Slower prepayment speeds result in lower mortgage servicing rights amortization
SunTrust Mortgage uses selective servicing sales to reduce risk
Portfolio ARM products are desired by borrowers and balances grow
In a rising rate environment servicing income grows through slower prepayment speeds, offsetting lower production volumes and income

The Advantage of the<br/>Natural Hedge vs. the Financial Hedge
MSRs represent 90 bps of non-portfolio balances  among lowest in the industry
MSRs represent 90 bps of non-portfolio balances  among lowest in the industry
MSR book value equals $681 million; market value exceeds $1 billion
Net positive value is a result of our balanced business approach  no cash hedge losses
Given the cyclical nature of the business, we believe it is prudent to reduce some of our risk to falling rates

Portfolio Management Committee
The Bank has established a formal process to periodically review credit portfolio performance by LOB, geography, industry, and counterparty risk concentrations. This data will be viewed in a risk/reward framework
The Bank has established a formal process to periodically review credit portfolio performance by LOB, geography, industry, and counterparty risk concentrations. This data will be viewed in a risk/reward framework
There are several key ways in which the new approach will add economic value:
Portfolio performance will be improved by a better understanding of the value creation process and the trade-offs required for optimal use of scarce or excess capital (regulatory and economic)
Pricing and origination strategies will be managed in a more dynamic manner using standardized, consistently applied and comprehensive metrics across our franchise
The Portfolio Management Committee has been formed to facilitate the most efficient use of SunTrust's regulatory and economic capital resources

Appendix
SunTrust presents total noninterest income and total revenue excluding realized securities gains/losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes total noninterest income and total revenue without securities gains/losses is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. SunTrust further excludes the net gain on the sale of RCM assets because the Company believes the exclusion of the net gain is more indicative of normalized operations.
SunTrust presents selected financial data on a basis that excludes merger expense, which represent incremental costs to integrate the operations of National Commerce Financial ("NCF"). The Company also presents selected financial data that further excludes the net gain related to the sale of RCM assets. The Company believes the exclusion of these two measures is more reflective of normalized operations.
The Company presents noninterest expense before an impairment charge on Affordable Housing Properties, amortization of intangible assets and merger expense. The Company believes the exclusion of these measures provides better comparability and is more reflective of normalized operations.
