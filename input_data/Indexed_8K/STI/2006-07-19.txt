For Immediate Release
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported record net income for the second quarter of 2006 of $544.0 million, up 17% from $465.7 million in the second quarter of 2005. Net income per diluted share was also a record $1.49, up 16% from $1.28 in the second quarter of 2005. Excluding merger expense incurred in the second quarter of 2005, net income and net income per diluted share were both up 9%.
     "SunTrust's concentrated, corporate-wide sales execution continues to pay off in strong across-the-board revenue and loan growth as we continue to leverage the opportunities that lie within our high-growth markets. Combine that with continued outstanding credit quality and the result is record earnings in the second quarter," L. Phillip Humann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust noted. Revenue growth of 8% over the second quarter of 2005 was led by strong double-digit growth in noninterest income. Average loan growth over the same time frame was a solid 12%. Mr. Humann noted that credit quality trends continued to remain near the historically low levels experienced over the past several quarters, with key credit measures such as net charge-offs to average loans and nonperforming loans to total loans increasing only two basis points over the cyclical lows of the first quarter of 2006.
Second Quarter 2006 Consolidated Highlights
 
Second Quarter 2006 Consolidated Highlights, continued
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
     Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,065.4 million for the second quarter of 2006, up 8% from the second quarter of 2005. The growth was driven by increases in both net interest and noninterest income. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent revenue increased 3% in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006 as a result of growth in noninterest income offset by a decline in net interest income.
     For the six months ended June 30, 2006, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $4,116.3 million, up 8% from $3,796.4 million for the same period in 2005. The growth was also driven by increases in both net interest and noninterest income.
Net Interest Income
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,190.0 million in the second quarter of 2006, up 4% from the second quarter of 2005. The primary factor driving the fully taxable-equivalent net interest income growth year-over-year was strong loan growth. Loans grew 12% on average from the second quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased 3% in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006 as a result of a decrease in loans held for sale and the associated spread as well as the continued shift in deposit mix away from lower cost deposit products to certificates of deposit. The net interest margin of 3.00% for the second quarter of 2006 was down 12 basis points from the first quarter of 2006. The margin decline was mainly attributable to the continued shift in deposit mix towards higher cost products and the negative impact the flatter yield curve has had on the spread between incremental earning asset growth and the cost of funding the growth.
     For the six months ended June 30, 2006, fully taxable net interest income was $2,389.4 million, up 5% from $2,271.7 million for the same period in 2005. Loan growth was also the main factor driving the increase.
 
Noninterest Income
     Total noninterest income was $875.4 million for the second quarter of 2006, up 14% from the second quarter of 2005. A significant portion of the increase resulted from growth in mortgage-related income, reflecting the continued strength in loan production-related income as well as an increase in mortgage servicing-related income. An increase in the level of loan sales, as well as our continued sales efforts, drove the increase in production-related income in the second quarter. The increase in servicing-related income experienced during the second quarter is an indication of the increased income created from a larger servicing portfolio and the realization of the value embedded in the mortgage servicing rights through the sale of a portion of the servicing rights. Double-digit growth in trading account profits and commissions, card fees, investment banking income and retail investment services also contributed to the year-over-year growth. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest income increased 11% in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006, driven by strong increases in trading account profits and commissions, investment banking income, card fees, retail investment services, trust and investment management income and service charges on deposits.
     For the six months ended June 30, 2006, noninterest income was $1,726.9 million, up 13% from $1,524.7 million for the same period in 2005. A significant portion of this growth was related to mortgage-related income. Card fees and trading account profits and commissions also had strong growth over the six months ended June 30, 2005.
Noninterest Expense
     Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2006 was $1,214.1 million, up 4% from the second quarter of 2005. Excluding merger related expense, noninterest expense grew 9% over the second quarter of 2005. The increase in expense reflects certain investments in revenue producing divisions of the Company, including the addition of offices and employees and investment in the infrastructure of the organization to gain greater efficiencies in the future. The increase in marketing and customer development expense reflects the Company's focus on customer acquisition. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest expense decreased 4% in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006. The decrease largely resulted from a decline in personnel expenses which resulted from the seasonally high benefit expense incurred in the first quarter of 2006.
     For the six months ended June 30, 2006, total noninterest expense was $2,440.6 million, up 6% from $2,306.7 million for the same period of 2005. Excluding merger related expense, noninterest expense grew 10% for the same period. The factors causing this increase were similar to those noted for the second quarter growth over the same quarter of the previous year.
     Revenue growth in the second quarter coupled with the decline in noninterest expense from the first quarter of 2006, led to positive operating leverage and improvement in the Company's efficiency ratio. The reported efficiency ratio was 58.78% for the second quarter of 2006 compared to 59.80% for the first quarter of 2006, an improvement of 102 basis points.
Balance Sheet
     As of June 30, 2006, SunTrust had total assets of $181.1 billion. Shareholders' equity of $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2006 represented 10% of total assets. Book value per share was $47.85 as of June 30, 2006, up from $47.22 as of March 31, 2006.
Loans
     Average loans for the second quarter of 2006 were $120.1 billion, up 12% from the second quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, average loans grew 13% in the second quarter of 2006 from the first quarter of 2006. Areas contributing to the strong loan growth both on a year-over-
 
year and sequential annualized basis were residential real estate, home equity line, commercial and construction lending.
Deposits
     Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter of 2006 were $97.2 billion, up 4% from the second quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 8% compared to the first quarter of 2006. The growth in deposits both year-over-year and on a sequential annualized basis was driven by growth in certificates of deposit. Given market conditions and the higher rate environment, customer preference is for higher-yielding deposit products, which is reflected in the continued deposit mix shift toward higher-rate products, such as certificates of deposit. The Company continues to pursue deposit growth initiatives aimed at product promotions, as well as increasing our presence in specific markets within our footprint.
Asset Quality
     Annualized net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2006 were 0.10% of average loans, up from the cyclical low of 0.08% reached in the first quarter of 2006 and down from 0.13% in the second quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $29.1 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared to $22.3 million in the first quarter of 2006 and $35.4 million in the second quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets were up $35.5 million, or 11%, in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2006, but were down $10.5 million, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2005. The increase from the first quarter of 2006 was mainly driven by increases in commercial and residential real estate nonperforming loans. Nonperforming assets were $369.8 million, or 0.31% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of June 30, 2006 compared to $334.3 million, or 0.28% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of March 31, 2006.
     The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $22.6 million to $1,061.9 million as of June 30, 2006 from $1,039.2 million as of March 31, 2006 primarily due to strong loan growth during the period. Provision expense increased from $33.4 million in the first quarter of 2006 to $51.8 million in the second quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2006 represented 0.88% of period-end loans, flat from March 31, 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2006 represented 325% of period-end nonperforming loans.
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Retail
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Retail's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $198.8 million, an increase of $32.9 million, or 20%, compared to the second quarter of 2005. The increase was primarily the result of
 
higher fully taxable-equivalent net interest income, lower net charge-offs and higher noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $68.1 million, or 13%. The increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $453.9 million, or 2%, and average deposits increased $4.5 billion, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2005. The loan growth was driven primarily by home equity lines and loans partially offset by declines in consumer indirect and student loans, while the deposit growth was driven primarily by certificates of deposit.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $10.8 million, or 36%, from the second quarter of 2005 primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect net charge-offs.
     Total noninterest income increased $9.8 million, or 4%, from the second quarter of 2005. This increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes and gains on sales of student loans.
     Total noninterest expense increased $40.5 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by increases in personnel expense and operation costs related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Retail's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $390.3 million, an increase of $80.7 million, or 26%, compared to the same period in 2005. The increase was primarily the result of higher fully taxable-equivalent net interest income, lower net charge-offs and higher noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $139.3 million, or 13%. The increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $1.1 billion, or 4%, and average deposits increased $4.1 billion, or 6%. The loan growth was driven by home equity lines and loans partially offset by declines in consumer indirect and student loans, while the deposit growth was driven primarily by certificates of deposit.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $23.6 million, or 38%, primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect net charge-offs.
     Total noninterest income increased $30.0 million, or 6%. The increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes, ATM fees and gains on sales of student loans.
     Total noninterest expense increased $71.5 million, or 7%. The increase was driven by increases in personnel expense and operation costs related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology.
Commercial
 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Commercial's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $108.9 million, an increase of $8.5 million, or 8%, compared to the second quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by increases in fully taxable-equivalent net interest and noninterest income and a lower effective tax rate related to affordable housing tax benefits, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $13.9 million, or 6%. The increase was attributable to increased loan volumes and widening deposit spreads. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2005 led by growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $254.8 million, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2005 driven by an increase in public funds and partially offset by a decrease in demand deposit and money market account balances. The decline in demand deposit balances was mainly attributable to an increase in customer balances being swept to higher-yielding investment alternatives, which has resulted in an increase in sweep income noted below.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $3.4 million from the second quarter of 2005. Despite this increase, the annualized net charge-off ratio for the Commercial line of business was only .08% for the second quarter of 2006.
     Total noninterest income increased $7.0 million, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2005. The increase resulted from increases in Affordable Housing revenues, sweep income and sales and referral credits.
     Total noninterest expense increased $11.8 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005. Investment in revenue-producing personnel was the primary driver.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Commercial's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $216.2 million, an increase of $24.6 million, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2005. The increase was primarily driven by higher fully taxable-equivalent net interest and noninterest income and a lower effective tax rate related to affordable housing tax benefits, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $36.4 million, or 8%. The increase results from higher loan volumes and widening deposit spreads. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, led by growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $351.4 million, or 3%, driven by an increase in public funds and partially offset by a decrease in demand deposit and money market account balances. The decline in demand deposit balances was mainly attributable to an increase in customer balances being swept to higher-yielding investment alternatives, which has resulted in an increase in sweep income noted below.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $2.7 million. Despite this increase, the annualized net charge-off ratio for the Commercial line of business was only .03% for the six months ended June 30, 2006.
     Total noninterest income increased $18.4 million, or 16%. The increase resulted from increases in Affordable Housing revenues, sweep income and sales and referral credits.
     Total noninterest expense increased $25.5 million, or 9%. Investment in revenue-producing personnel was the primary driver.
 
Corporate and Investment Banking
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $68.8 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 1%, compared to the second quarter of 2005. Growth in noninterest income, mainly driven by capital markets revenue, was offset by decreased fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and increased noninterest expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $7.0 million, or 11%. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in loan spreads. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2005. The loan growth was driven by increased corporate demand and growth in leasing. Average deposits decreased $256.8 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005. The decline in deposits was led by a reduction in certain bid-category products that the line of business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, improved from a net recovery position of $0.01 million in the second quarter of 2005 to a net recovery position of $0.4 million in the same period in 2006.
     Total noninterest income increased $7.8 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2005. Noninterest income growth was driven mainly by Debt Capital Markets revenue, primarily in securitization and structured leasing along with strong growth in equity offerings. The growth was partially offset by weakness in merger and acquisition related fees and equity trading.
     Total noninterest expense increased $0.6 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2005. The increase was related to higher personnel expense as a direct result of capital markets revenue growth.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $133.6 million, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2005. Growth in the fully taxable-equivalent net interest margin and capital markets revenue in the six months ending June 30, 2006 was offset by the divestiture of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $1.3 million, or 1%, from the six month period ending June 30, 2005. The divestiture of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005 negatively impacted growth in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income. Average loans increased $1.9 billion, or 13%, and average deposits increased $149.2 million, or 5%, from the six month period ending June 30, 2005. Loan growth was due to increased corporate demand, growth in leasing and merger and acquisition activity. Deposit growth was driven by an increase in demand for certificates of deposit partially offset by a decrease in certain bid-category products that the line of business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, improved from a net recovery position of $0.7 million in the first six months of 2005 to a net recovery position of $0.8 million in the same period in 2006.
 
     Total noninterest income decreased $11.9 million, or 4%, primarily driven by the divestiture of factoring assets in the first quarter of 2005. Noninterest income growth was driven mainly by Debt Capital Markets revenue, which was primarily driven by securitization, derivative trading and structured leasing, along with strong growth in equity offerings. The growth was partially offset by weakness in merger and acquisition related fees and equity trading.
     Total noninterest expense increased $4.3 million, or 2%. The increase was related to higher personnel expense as a direct result of capital markets revenue growth partially offset by the expense reduction from the factoring asset divestiture.
Mortgage
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Mortgage's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $62.9 million, an increase of $26.7 million, or 73%, compared to the second quarter of 2005. Strong fully taxable-equivalent revenue growth driven by gains from the sale of out-of-footprint mortgage servicing assets, record production and loan sales to investors, as well as loan growth, drove the increase in net income. In the latter part of second quarter 2006, in conjunction with the Company's balance sheet management strategy, the Company sold approximately $1.0 billion of its lower-yielding consumer mortgages and moved approximately $0.8 billion in additional mortgages to loans held for sale in anticipation of their subsequent sale. The transaction affected balances at the end of the period, but had a minimal effect on average loans.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $18.5 million, or 14%, principally due to growth in loans and deposits that was partially offset by lower net interest income on loans held for sale. Average loans, primarily adjustable rate mortgages, increased $9.0 billion, or 39%, due to continued demand for portfolio loan products and strong construction-permanent loan production. The loan growth contributed $28.5 million to the higher net interest income. Average deposits were up $247.7 million, or 16%, due to escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances. The higher balances combined with a higher credit for funds rate contributed $7.6 million to net interest income. While average loans held for sale increased $1.4 billion, or 24%, compressed spreads resulting from increased short-term interest rates reduced net interest income on loans held for sale $15.0 million, or 37%.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $0.7 million, or 25%.
     Total noninterest income increased $49.1 million, or 96%, from the second quarter of 2005. Production income was up $30.3 million, or 113%, due to record production and loan sales to investors. Loan production of $15.0 billion was up $3.8 billion, or 34%, over second quarter 2005. Loan sales to investors were $10.7 billion, up $3.8 billion, or 55%. Excluding $1.0 billion of loans sold from the consumer mortgage loan portfolio, loan sales to investors were $9.7 billion, up $2.8 billion, or 40%. Servicing income increased $20.5 million, or 197%. Higher servicing income resulted from a $17.4 million gain on the sale of out-of-footprint mortgage servicing rights with an unpaid principal balance of $3.3 billion and higher fee income due to higher servicing balances. Partially offsetting these increases was increased mortgage servicing rights amortization. At June 30, 2006, total loans serviced were $121.4 billion compared with $89.1 billion the prior year, an increase of $32.3 billion, or 36%.
 
     Total noninterest expense increased $26.7 million, or 21%, from the second quarter of 2005. Increased volume and growth-related expenses were the primary drivers of the higher expense.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Mortgage's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $142.4 million, an increase of $68.3 million, or 92%, compared to the same period in 2005. Strong fully taxable-equivalent revenue growth driven by gains from sale of mortgage servicing assets, higher loan production, greater loan sales to investors, as well as loan growth, drove the increase in net income. In the latter part of second quarter 2006 in conjunction with the Company's balance sheet management strategy, the Company sold approximately $1.0 billion of its lower yielding consumer mortgages and moved approximately $0.8 billion in additional mortgages to loans held for sale in anticipation of their subsequent sale. The transaction affected balances at the end of the period, but had a minimal effect on average loans.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $41.5 million, or 16%, principally due to growth in loans and deposits that was partially offset by lower net interest income on loans held for sale. Average loans, primarily adjustable rate mortgages, increased $8.0 billion, or 35%, due to continued demand for portfolio loan products and strong construction-permanent loan production. This loan growth contributed $50.8 million to the higher net interest income. Average deposits increased $196.9 million, or 14%, due to escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances. These balances combined with a higher credit for funds rate contributed $12.2 million to net interest income. Average loans held for sale were up $2.4 billion, or 40%. However, compressed spreads resulting from increased short-term interest rates, reduced net interest income on loans held for sale $18.5 million, or 22%.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business increased $1.1 million, or 29%.
     Total noninterest income increased $124.6 million, or 130%. Production income of $120.7 million increased $74.0 million, or 159%, driven by higher production and loan sales to investors. Year-to-date loan production was $26.6 billion compared with $19.9 billion for the comparable period in 2005, an increase of $6.7 billion, or 34%. Loan sales to investors were $21.0 billion, up $8.7 billion, or 71%. Excluding $1.0 billion of loans sold from the consumer mortgage loan portfolio, loan sales to investors were $20.0 billion, up $7.7 billion, or 62%. Servicing income of $75.1 million was up $52.9 million, an increase of 238%, due to gains from the sale of mortgage servicing assets of $41.8 million and increased fees from higher servicing balances.
     Total noninterest expense increased $57.7 million, or 24%, from the prior year-to-date period. Increased volume and growth-related expenses were the primary drivers of this increase.
Wealth and Investment Management
 
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $53.5 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or 3%, compared to the second quarter of 2005. The growth year-over-year was primarily driven by increases in both fully tax-equivalent net interest and noninterest revenue which was partially offset by continuing efforts to build out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $9.1 million, or 11%, due to increases in loan balances and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $0.4 billion, or 5%, driven by commercial loan growth. Average deposits decreased $0.5 billion, or 5%, due to a decline in money market and NOW account balances, partially offset by certificate of deposit growth.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $0.2 million from the second quarter of 2005.
     Total noninterest income increased $18.1 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2005 attributable to growth in trust income that resulted from growth in assets under management and improved market conditions, as well as increased retail investment income and other income. End of period assets under management were approximately $134.8 billion compared to approximately $130.3 billion at the end of the same period last year. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management and participant-directed retirement accounts. Total assets under advisement were approximately $249.3 billion, which includes the $134.8 billion in assets under management, $51.2 billion in non-managed trust assets, $35.0 billion in retail brokerage assets and $28.3 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.
     Total noninterest expense increased $24.7 million, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2005. The growth was primarily driven by the continuing efforts to build out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expense.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     In a continuing effort to enhance the segment reporting process, modifications were made to corporate methodologies related to the allocation of corporate overhead, advertising and systems development. While these reallocations affected all of the lines of business, only Wealth and Investment Management was significantly impacted. As a result of these changes, Wealth and Investment Management's first quarter 2006 net income growth was adjusted from 7% as previously reported to 12%. The effect of the first quarter modifications, coupled with the 3% second quarter 2006 net income growth, produces year-to-date net income growth of 7%, which is fully representative of the financial performance of the line of business.
     Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $98.1 million, an increase of $6.5 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2005. The growth year-over-year was driven primarily by increases in both fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by continuing efforts to build out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $23.9 million, or 15%, and was attributable to a combination of increased loan volumes and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases. Average loans increased $0.5 billion, or 6%, led by growth in commercial real estate and commercial loans. Average deposits decreased $0.3 billion, or 3%, due to declines in NOW and money market account balances, partially offset by certificates of deposit growth.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business decreased $0.2 million.
 
     Total noninterest income increased $24.3 million, or 5%. Noninterest income was driven by growth in trust and retail investment income. Trust income increased due to increases in recurring fees that resulted from growth in assets under management and improved market conditions. Retail investment (brokerage) income increased due to improvements in annuity, managed account and new business revenues.
     Total noninterest expense increased $38.2 million, or 8%. The growth was primarily driven by the continuing efforts to build out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expense.
Corporate Other and Treasury
Three Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $51.1 million, an increase of $7.9 million, or 18%, compared to the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to a decrease in merger-related expense offset by a decrease in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $55.0 million, or 54%. The main drivers for the reduction in net interest income were a $1.7 billion decrease on average in securities available for sale, a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio and an increase in short-term borrowing costs due to an increase in the size of these borrowings needed to fund earning asset growth, as well as a significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
     Total average deposits increased $11.3 billion, or 71%, from the second quarter of 2005 mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits of $11.5 billion.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $12.5 million from the second quarter of 2005, representing additional provision expense necessary to support the Company's strong loan growth.
     Total noninterest income increased $12.6 million, or 91%, from the second quarter of 2005. This was mainly due to an increase in securities gains of $6.4 million and miscellaneous income of $5.7 million.
     Total noninterest expense decreased $63.0 million from $59.4 million in 2005 to a net recovery of $3.6 million in 2006. This was mainly due to a reduction in merger-related expense of $53.9 million.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2006 vs. 2005
     Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $94.9 million, a decrease of $53.9 million, or 36%, compared to the same period in 2005, primarily due to decline in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income offset by a decrease in merger-related expense.
     Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $124.7 million, or 53%. The main drivers for the reduction in net interest income were a $1.9 billion decrease on average in securities available for sale, a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio and an increase in short-term borrowing costs due to an increase in the size of these borrowings needed to fund earning asset growth, as well as a significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
 
     Total average deposits increased $11.1 billion, or 75%, from the second quarter of 2005 mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits of $11.4 billion.
     Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $46.9 million to $35.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, representing additional provision expense necessary to support the Company's strong loan growth.
     Total noninterest income increased $16.8 million, or 93%. This was mainly due to securities gains of $6.0 million as compared to securities losses of $6.9 million in 2005.
     Total noninterest expense decreased $63.3 million from $72.4 million in 2005 to $9.1 million in 2006. This decline was mainly due to a reduction in merger-related expense of $79.0 million.
