(c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs & Co., will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
 
7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Shares under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(c) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey (provided, however, that the aggregate fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with this subsection (iii) and subsection (v) below shall not exceed $30,000 without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld); (iv) the fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Shares; (v) filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Shares; (vi) all fees and expenses in connection with the listing of the Shares; (vii) the cost of preparing the Shares; (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent or registrar or dividend distributing agent; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder that are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Shares by them, the cost of preparing and distributing any term sheet prepared by any Underwriter, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in your discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

(g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock;

(i) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement;

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
 
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
 
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
 
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares that remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate number of all Shares, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b)
 
above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Shares.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Shares, except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, any Shares are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares not so delivered, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Shares except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you jointly or by Goldman, Sachs & Co. on behalf of you as the representatives.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the representatives in care of Goldman Sachs at One New York Plaza, 42
nd
Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent, fiduciary or advisor of the Company (and the Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters owe, or any of them owes, a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection therewith), and (iii) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax
 
treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

ANNEX I(a)
Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
As representatives of the several Underwriters,
c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
85 Broad Street,
New York, New York 10004.
Re: SunTrust Banks, Inc. $500,000,000 Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I have acted as counsel for SunTrust Banks, Inc., a Georgia corporation ("SunTrust"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") thereunder of 5,000 shares of the Company's Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the "Preferred Shares"), which are represented by 20,000,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares" and together, with the Preferred Shares, the "Shares"). The Depositary Shares are to be issued pursuant to the Deposit Agreement dated September , 2006 (the "Deposit Agreement") among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as Depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts issued thereunder. This opinion is being rendered at the Company's request pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated September 5, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
    
In my capacity as such counsel, I have reviewed (i) copies of the registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-137101) (the
"Registration Statement"), filed by the Company with the Commission under the Securities Act, as it became effective under the Securities Act, including the prospectus included therein (the "Base Prospectus"), (ii) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated September 5, 2006 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Preliminary Prospectus") (iii) the prospectus supplement dated September 5, 2006 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus") and (iv) the final term sheet dated September 5, 2006 filed pursuant to Rule 433 promulgated under the Securities Act (the "Final Term Sheet" and together with the Preliminary Prospectus, the "Pricing Disclosure Package"). For the avoidance of doubt, any reference to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus includes all documents incorporated by reference therein.
In so acting, I have examined and relied upon the accuracy of original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such records, agreements, certificates and other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable me to render the opinion set forth below. In all such examinations, I have assumed the genuineness of signatures on original documents and the conformity to such original documents of all copies submitted to me as certified, conformed or photographic copies and, as to certificates of public officials, I have assumed the same have been properly given and to be accurate.
I have also relied, as to various matters of fact material to this opinion, without independent verification, upon certificates of public officials and officers of SunTrust and its subsidiaries Whenever my opinion with respect to any matter is stated to be based upon my knowledge or to be given "to my knowledge" or as "known by me," such qualifications shall signify that no information has come to my attention that would give me actual current awareness of the existence or absence of the matter in question.
Based on the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia, and is duly registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, with power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;
(ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
 
(iii) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of the failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction;
(iv) SunTrust Bank has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Georgia; and except as set forth in the Prospectus, all of the issued shares of capital stock of SunTrust Bank are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(v) To my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which is reasonably likely to be adversely determined against the Company or any of its subsidiaries and, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future general affairs, management, consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
(vi) The issue and sale of the Shares and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Shares and the Deposit Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or SunTrust Bank is a party or by which the Company or SunTrust Bank is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or SunTrust Bank is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or SunTrust Bank or any of their properties;
 
(vii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Shares or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Deposit Agreement, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriters;
(viii) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof, will not be an "investment company", as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act;
(ix) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus and any further amendments and supplements thereto, as applicable, made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial information contained therein and the Form T-1 Statements of Eligibility and Qualification filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to which I express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and

The Depositary Shares are to be issued pursuant to the Deposit Agreement dated September , 2006 (the "Deposit Agreement") among the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as Depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts issued thereunder. This opinion is being rendered at the Company's request pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement dated September 5, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters. Unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
    
In our capacity as such counsel, we have reviewed (i) copies of the registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-137101) (the "Registration Statement"), filed by the Company with the Commission under the Securities Act, as it became effective under the Securities Act, including the prospectus included therein (the "Base Prospectus"), (ii) the preliminary prospectus supplement dated September 5, 2006 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated under the Securities Act, (iii) the prospectus supplement dated September 5, 2006 filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated under the

This opinion is limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State of New York, and the laws of the State of Georgia, and no opinion is expressed with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction or any effect which such laws may have on the opinions expressed herein. This opinion is limited to the matters stated herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
(i) The Preferred Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and conform to the description of the Preferred Shares contained in the Prospectus;
(ii) The Depositary Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, and conform to the description of the Depositary Shares contained in the Prospectus;
(iii) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
(iv) The Deposit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that the Depositary has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Deposit Agreement and has otherwise satisfied all legal requirements applicable to it to the extent necessary to make the Deposit Agreement binding against it, the Deposit Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, and the effects of general principles of equity;
 
(v) The statements set forth in the Prospectus under the caption, "Description of Series A Preferred Stock" and "Description of the Depositary Shares", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Preferred Shares and the Depositary Shares, respectively, and "Underwriting", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein, constitute an accurate summary of the matters set forth therein in all material respects; the statements set forth in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of matters of U.S. federal income tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute an accurate summary of the matters set forth therein in all material respects.
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you after the date hereof of facts or circumstances that come to our attention or changes in law that occur which could affect the opinions contained herein.
This opinion is rendered solely to you in connection with the above matter. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or relied upon by or furnished to any other person without our prior written consent.

(3) The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Corporation for the benefit of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.

Unless and until definitive Receipts are delivered to the owners of the beneficial interests in a Global Registered Receipt, (1) the applicable Global Receipt Depository will make book-entry transfers among its participants and receive and transmit all payments and distributions in respect of the Global Registered Receipts to such participants, in each case, in accordance with its applicable procedures and arrangements, and (2) whenever any notice, payment or other communication to the holders of Global Registered Receipts is required under this Deposit Agreement, the Company and the Depositary shall give all such notices, payments and communications specified herein to be given to such holders to the applicable Global Receipt Depository.
If an Exchange Event has occurred with respect to any Global Registered Receipt, then, in any such event, the Depositary shall, upon receipt of a written order from the Company for the execution and delivery of individual definitive registered Receipts in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt, shall execute and deliver, individual definitive registered Receipts, in authorized denominations and of like tenor and terms in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Registered Receipt in exchange for such Global Registered Receipt.
Definitive registered Receipts issued in exchange for a Global Registered Receipt pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Global Receipt Depository for such Global Registered Receipt, pursuant to instructions from its participants, shall instruct the Depositary in writing. The Depositary shall deliver such Receipts to the persons in whose names such Receipts are so registered.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Deposit Agreement, should the Company determine that the Receipts should be issued as a Global Registered Receipt, the parties hereto shall comply with the terms of each Letter of Representations.
 
Section 3.1.
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
Any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file such proof of residence, or other matters or other information, to execute such certificates and to make such representations and warranties as the Depositary or the Company may reasonably deem necessary or proper. The Depositary or the Company may withhold the delivery, or delay the registration of transfer or redemption, of any Receipt or the withdrawal of the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt or the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof until such proof or other information is filed or such certificates are executed or such representations and warranties are made.
Section 3.2.
Payment of Taxes or Other Governmental Charges.
Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain charges and expenses, as provided in Section 5.7. Registration of transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of Stock and all money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused until any such payment due is made, and any dividends, interest payments or other distributions may be withheld or any part of or all the Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt and not theretofore sold may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder prior to such sale), and such dividends, interest payments or other distributions or the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such charges or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
Section 3.3.
Warranty as to Stock.
The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Stock, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
Section 3.4.
Warranty as to Receipts.
The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will represent legal and valid interests in the Stock. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
Section 4.1.
Cash Distributions.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of such dividend or distribution as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; provided, however, that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required to withhold and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Stock an amount on account of taxes, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount, however, as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Depositary Shares a fraction of one cent, and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next sum received by the Depositary for distribution to record holders of Receipts then outstanding. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with its certified tax identification number on a properly completed Form W-8 or W-9, as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distributions to be made hereunder.
Section 4.2.
Distributions Other than Cash, Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash, rights, preferences or privileges upon Stock, the Depositary shall, at the direction of the Company, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.4 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. If in the opinion of the Depositary such distribution cannot be made proportionately among such record holders in accordance with the direction of the Company, or if for any other reason (including any requirement that the Company or the Depositary withhold an amount on account of taxes) the Depositary deems, after consultation with the Company, such distribution not to be feasible, the Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, adopt such method as it deems equitable and practicable for the purpose of effecting such distribution, including the sale (at public or private sale) of the securities or property thus received, or any part thereof, in a commercially reasonable manner. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed or made available for distribution, as the case may be, by the Depositary to record holders of
 
Receipts as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Company shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the Depositary and the Depositary shall not make any distribution of such securities or property to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided an opinion of counsel stating that such securities or property have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered in connection with such distributions.
Section 4.3.
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names Stock is recorded on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing, either by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges or by such other method as may be approved by the Company; provided, however, that (i) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Depositary determines that it is not lawful or (after consultation with the Company) not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to holders of Receipts by the issue of warrants or otherwise, or (ii) if and to the extent so instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, then the Depositary, in its discretion (with approval of the Company, in any case where the Depositary has determined that it is not feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available), may, if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges permit such transfer, sell such rights, preferences or privileges at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Sections 3.1 and 3.2, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.1 in the case of a distribution received in cash.
The Company shall notify the Depositary whether registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, and the Company agrees with the Depositary that it will file promptly a registration statement pursuant to such Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its best efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such registration statement shall have become effective, or the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to the effect that the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act.
 
The Company shall notify the Depositary whether any other action under the laws of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, and the Company agrees with the Depositary that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
Section 4.4.
Notice of Dividends, etc.; Fixing Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable or any distribution other than cash shall be made, or if rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of any meeting at which holders of Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of Stock are entitled to notice, or whenever the Depositary and the Company shall decide it is appropriate, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to, or otherwise in accordance with the terms of, the Stock, as identified in a written notice to the Depositary of such record date) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, or to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting, or who shall be entitled to notice of such meeting or for any other appropriate reasons.
Section 4.5.
Voting Rights.
Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice prepared by the Company which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting and (ii) a statement that the holders may, subject to any applicable restrictions, instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares (including an express indication that instructions may be given to the Depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by the Company) and a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the holders of Receipts on the relevant record date, the Depositary shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of whole shares of Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by all Receipts as to which any particular voting instructions are received. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action which may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Stock or cause such Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote, to the extent permitted by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or any other applicable regulatory body, the Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt of such holder proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received by the other holders.
 
Section 4.6.
Changes Affecting Deposited Securities and Reclassifications, Recapitalizations, etc.
Upon any change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Stock, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation affecting the Company or to which it is a party, the Depositary may in its discretion with the approval of, and shall upon the instructions of, the Company, and (in either case) in such manner as the Depositary may deem equitable, (i) make such adjustments as are certified by the Company in the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Stock and in the ratio of the Depositary Share Redemption Price to the Preferred Stock Redemption Price, in each case as may be necessary fully to reflect the effects of such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Stock, or of such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation and (ii) treat any securities which shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or upon conversion of or in respect of the Stock as new deposited securities so received in exchange for or upon conversion or in respect of such Stock. In any such case the Depositary may in its discretion, with the approval of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited securities. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, holders of Receipts shall have the right from and after the effective date of any such change in par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of the Stock or any such recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation to surrender such Receipts to the Depositary with instructions to convert, exchange or surrender the Stock represented thereby only into or for, as the case may be, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property and cash into which the Stock represented by such Receipts might have been converted or for which such Stock might have been exchanged or surrendered immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction.
Section 4.7.
Delivery of Reports.
The Depositary shall furnish to holders of Receipts any reports and communications received from the Company which are received by the Depositary and which the Company is required to furnish to the holders of the Stock.
Section 4.8.
Lists of Receipt Holders.
Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, at the sole expense of the Company, the Depositary shall furnish to it a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all record holders of Receipts.
 
Section 5.1.
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary; Registrar.
Upon execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary's Office, facilities for the execution and delivery, registration and registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of Receipts, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
The Depositary shall keep books at the Depositary's Office for the registration and registration of transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts; provided that any such holder requesting to exercise such right shall certify to the Depositary that such inspection shall be for a proper purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as an owner of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts.
The Depositary may close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
The Depositary may, with the approval of the Company, appoint a Registrar for registration of the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby. If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on one or more national stock exchanges, the Depositary will appoint a Registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with any requirements of such exchange. Such Registrar (which may be the Depositary if so permitted by the requirements of any such exchange) may be removed and a substitute Registrar appointed by the Depositary upon the request or with the approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Depositary will, at the request of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, registration, registration of transfer, surrender and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulation.
Section 5.2.
Prevention of or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt if by reason of any provision of any present or future law, or regulation thereunder, of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (including the Articles), or by
 
reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from, or subjected to any penalty on account of, doing or performing any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur liability to any holder of a Receipt (i) by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing which the terms of this Deposit Agreement shall provide shall or may be done or performed, or (ii) by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this Deposit Agreement.
Section 5.3.
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts other than for its negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Depositary, nor the Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be liable in any event for special, punitive, incidental, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits).
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be under, any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts which in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Registrar nor the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the written advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information from any person presenting Stock for deposit, any holder of a Receipt or any other person believed by it in good faith to be competent to give such information. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon or omitting to act upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
The Depositary will indemnify the Company against any liability which may directly arise out of acts performed or omitted by the Depositary due to its gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, however, in no event shall the Depositary be liable for consequential, special or indirect damages of any kind, regardless of whether the Depositary is put on notice of the possibility of such damages. The Depositary shall not be liable for the acts or omissions due to the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of any Depositary's Agent, so long as such Depositary's Agent was appointed with due care.
 
The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the shares of Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action is not taken in bad faith. The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar.
The Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, and any Registrar may own and deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates.
The Depositary shall not be under any liability for interest on any monies at any time received by it pursuant to any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Receipts, the Depositary Shares or the Stock nor shall it be obligated to segregate such monies from other monies held by it, except as required by law. The Depositary shall not be responsible for advancing funds on behalf of the Company and shall have no duty or obligation to make any payments if it has not timely received sufficient funds to make timely payments.
In the event the Depositary believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by the Depositary hereunder, or in the administration of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the Depositary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, omitting or suffering to take any action hereunder, the Depositary may, in its sole discretion upon written notice to the Company, refrain from taking any action and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Company, any holders of Receipts or any other person or entity for refraining from taking such action, unless the Depositary receives written instructions or a certificate signed by the Company which eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary or which proves or establishes the applicable matter to the satisfaction of the Depositary. The Depositary shall not be liable to the Company, any holder of Receipts, or any action taken by it in accordance with the written instruction of the Company or the holders of Receipts.
Section 5.4.
Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.
The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by delivering notice of its election to do so to the Company, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor Depositary hereunder and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
 
In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor Depositary, which shall be a bank or trust company having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If no successor Depositary shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after delivery of such notice, the resigning or removed Depositary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Depositary. Every successor Depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor Depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all right, title and interest in the Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor, and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts and such records, books and other information in its possession relating thereto. Any successor Depositary shall promptly mail notice of its appointment to the record holders of Receipts.
Any entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted shall be the successor of such Depositary without the execution or filing of any document or any further act, and notice thereof shall not be required hereunder. Such successor Depositary may authenticate the Receipts in the name of the predecessor Depositary or in the name of the successor Depositary.
Section 5.5.
Corporate Notices and Reports.
The Company agrees that it will deliver to the Depositary, and the Depositary will, promptly after receipt thereof, transmit to the record holders of Receipts, in each case at the addresses recorded in the Depositary's books, copies of all notices and reports (including without limitation financial statements) required by law, by the rules of any national securities exchange upon which the Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts are listed or by the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (including the Articles), to be furnished to the record holders of Receipts. Such transmission will be at the Company's expense and the Company will provide the Depositary with such number of copies of such documents as the Depositary may reasonably request. In addition, the Depositary will transmit to the record holders of Receipts at the Company's expense such other documents as may be requested by the Company.
 
Section 5.6.
Indemnification by the Company.
Notwithstanding Section 5.3 to the contrary, the Company shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar (including each of their officers, directors, agents and employees) against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, damage, cost, penalty, liability or expense (including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of acts performed, suffered or omitted to be taken in connection with this Agreement and the Receipts by the Depositary, any Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent) and any transactions or documents contemplated hereby, except for any liability arising out of negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the respective parts of any such person or persons. The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.6 shall survive any succession of any Depositary, Registrar or Depositary's Agent.
Section 5.7.
Fees, Charges and Expenses.
The Company agrees promptly to pay the Depositary the compensation to be agreed upon with the Company for all services rendered by the Depositary hereunder and to reimburse the Depositary for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Depositary without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part (or on the part of any Depositary's Agent) in connection with the services rendered by it (or such Depositary's Agent) hereunder. The Company shall pay all charges of the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the Stock and the initial issuance of the Depositary Shares, all withdrawals of shares of the Stock by owners of Depositary Shares, and any redemption or exchange of the Stock at the option of the Company. The Company shall pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. All other transfer and other taxes and governmental charges shall be at the expense of holders of Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts. If, at the request of a holder of Receipts, the Depositary incurs charges or expenses for which the Company is not otherwise liable hereunder, such holder will be liable for such charges and expenses; provided, however, that the Depositary may, at its sole option, require a holder of a Receipt to prepay the Depositary any charge or expense the Depositary has been asked to incur at the request of such holder of Receipts. The Depositary shall present its statement for charges and expenses to the Company at such intervals as the Company and the Depositary may agree.
Section 6.1.
Amendment.
The form of the Receipts and any provisions of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Company and the Depositary in any respect which they may deem necessary or desirable; provided,
 
however, that no such amendment which shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the holders of Receipts shall be effective unless such amendment shall have been approved by the holders of at least a majority (or, in the case of amendments relating to or affecting rights to receive dividends or distributions or voting or redemption rights, two-thirds of the holders) of the Depositary Shares then outstanding. Every holder of an outstanding Receipt at the time any such amendment becomes effective shall be deemed, by continuing to hold such Receipt, to consent and agree to such amendment and to be bound by the Depositary Agreement as amended thereby. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 and Article III, of any owner of Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt evidencing such Depositary Shares to the Depositary with instructions to deliver to the holder the Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any governmental body, agency or commission, or applicable stock exchange.
Section 6.2.
Termination.
This Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time upon not less than 60 days prior written notice to the Depositary, in which case, at least 30 days prior to the date fixed in such notice for such termination, the Depositary will mail notice of such termination to the record holders of all Receipts then outstanding.
If any Receipts shall remain outstanding after the date of termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary thereafter shall discontinue the transfer of Receipts, shall suspend the distribution of dividends to the holders thereof and shall not give any further notices (other than notice of such termination) or perform any further acts under this Deposit Agreement, except that the Depositary shall continue to collect dividends and other distributions pertaining to Stock, shall sell rights, preferences or privileges as provided in this Deposit Agreement and shall deliver the number of whole or fractional shares of Stock and any money and other property, if any, represented by Receipts upon surrender thereof by the holders thereof. At any time after the expiration of two years from the date of termination, the Depositary may sell Stock then held hereunder at public or private sale, at such places and upon such terms as it deems proper and may thereafter hold the net proceeds of any such sale, together with any money and other property held by it hereunder, without liability for interest, for the benefit, pro rata in accordance with their holdings, of the holders of Receipts that have not theretofore been surrendered. After making such sale, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except to account for such net proceeds and money and other property.
This Agreement will terminate automatically if (i) all outstanding Depositary Shares have been redeemed pursuant to Section 2.8, or (ii) there shall have been made a final distribution in respect of the Stock in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company and such distribution shall have been distributed to the holders of Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, as applicable.
 
Upon the termination of this Deposit Agreement, the Company shall be discharged from all obligations under this Deposit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Registrar under Sections 5.6 and 5.7.
Section 7.1.
Counterparts.
This Deposit Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by each of the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

This Deposit Agreement is for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective successors hereunder, and shall not be deemed to give any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim to any other person whatsoever.

Invalidity of Provisions.
In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts should be or become invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein or therein shall in no way be affected, prejudiced or disturbed thereby.

In so acting, we have examined and relied upon the accuracy of original, certified, conformed or photographic copies of such records, agreements, certificates and other documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate to enable us to render the opinions set forth below.

This opinion is limited to the matters stated herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that the Depositary Shares, when issued and delivered pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, and issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, will have been validly issued and will represent a fractional interest in a duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Preferred Stock.
This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to advise you after the date hereof of facts or circumstances that come to our attention or changes in law that occur which could affect the opinions contained herein.
