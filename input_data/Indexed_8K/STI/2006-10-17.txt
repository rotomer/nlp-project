Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
October 17, 2006
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income for the third quarter of 2006 of $535.6 million, up 5% from $510.8 million in the third quarter of 2005. Net income per average common diluted share was $1.47, up 5% from $1.40 in the third quarter of 2005.
"Despite a challenging environment, which included a flat to inverted yield curve throughout the quarter, we were able to post solid results. We undertook a number of initiatives this quarter that, combined with our intense sales focus, strong credit quality and diversified business model, should provide momentum going into 2007," L. Phillip Humann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust noted. Despite strong year-over-year loan growth, the rate of revenue growth was slower than in prior quarters due to the challenging operating environment. The Company was able to offset the slower revenue growth by reducing the rate of expense growth through effective cost control initiatives, posting lower loan provision expense that resulted from improved credit loss experience, and realizing a lower provision for income taxes.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,032.8 million for the third quarter of 2006, up 1% from the third quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent revenue decreased 6% in the third quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2006.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $6,149.1 million, up 6% from $5,804.5 million for the same period in 2005.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,173.9 million in the third quarter of 2006, nearly unchanged from the third quarter of 2005. The lack of growth was mainly the result of the flat to inverted yield curve that has persisted over this timeframe, as well as the continued shift in deposit mix away from lower-cost deposit products to certificates of deposit. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased 5% in the third quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2006 for similar reasons. The net interest margin of 2.93% for the third quarter of 2006 was down 7 basis points from the second quarter of 2006. The margin decline was mainly attributable to the continued shift in deposit mix towards higher cost products and the negative impact the flat to inverted yield curve has had on the spread between incremental earning asset growth and the increased cost of funding the growth.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3,563.3 million, up 3% from $3,447.4 million for the same period in 2005. Loan growth was the main factor driving the increase.
 
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $858.9 million for the third quarter of 2006, up 3% from the third quarter of 2005. A significant portion of the increase resulted from the $113 million gain, net of related expenses, on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. The Company also restructured a portion of the investment portfolio in the third quarter of 2006 that accounted for substantially all of the $92 million in securities losses for the quarter. Growth in card fees, trust and investment management income and retail investment services income was offset primarily by declines in trading account profits and commissions, investment banking income, other charges and fees and service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in mortgage servicing-related income experienced during the third quarter is an indication of the increased income created from a larger servicing portfolio and the realization of the value embedded in the mortgage servicing rights through the sale of a portion of the servicing rights that resulted in a $23.9 million gain. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest income decreased 8% in the third quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2006. Aside from the aforementioned net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business and the securities losses incurred by the investment portfolio restructuring, the decrease was driven mainly by a decline in trading account profits and commissions and investment banking income, offset by increases in other noninterest income, card fees and service charges on deposits.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, noninterest income was $2,585.8 million, up 10% from $2,357.1 million for the same period in 2005. Aside from the aforementioned net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business and the securities losses incurred by the investment portfolio restructuring, the growth was driven mainly by mortgage-related income, card fees, trust and investment management income and retail investment services income.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2006 was $1,205.5 million, up 2% from the third quarter of 2005. The increase in expense reflects certain investments in revenue producing divisions of the Company, including the addition of offices and employees and investment in the infrastructure of the organization to gain greater efficiencies in the future. These increases were offset by lower amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges on affordable housing properties, and no merger expense incurred in 2006. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest expense declined 3% in the third quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2006. The decrease largely resulted from a decline in employee compensation and benefits and marketing and customer development expenses, offset by net occupancy, equipment and other expenses.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, total noninterest expense was $3,646.1 million, up 5% from $3,483.8 million for the same period of 2005. The factors causing this increase were similar to those noted for the third quarter growth over the same quarter of the previous year with the exception of lower equipment expense, higher marketing and customer development expense, and no merger expense incurred in 2006.
Balance Sheet
As of September 30, 2006, SunTrust had total assets of $183.1 billion. Shareholders' equity of $18.6 billion as of September 30, 2006 represented 10% of total assets. Book value per common share was $49.71 as of September 30, 2006, up from $47.85 as of June 30, 2006.
 
Loans
Average loans for the third quarter of 2006 were $120.7 billion, up 9% from the third quarter of 2005. The rate of growth was slowed by the sale of approximately $3 billion in residential real estate and student loans late in the second and early in the third quarters of 2006. Areas contributing to the strong loan growth were residential real estate, real estate construction, commercial and home equity lines. On a sequential annualized basis, average loans grew 2% in the third quarter of 2006 from the second quarter of 2006. The aforementioned sale of loans substantially slowed the growth rate between quarters. Areas contributing to the loan growth were similar to those noted for the third quarter growth over the same quarter of the previous year with the exception of residential real estate due to the impact of the loan sales.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter of 2006 were $97.6 billion, up 4% from the third quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 2% compared to the second quarter of 2006. The growth in deposits both year-over-year and on a sequential annualized basis was driven by growth in certificates of deposit. Given market conditions and the higher rate environment, customer preference is for higher-yielding products, which is reflected in the continued deposit mix shift toward higher-rate products, such as certificates of deposit. Furthermore, the third quarter is typically the slowest growth quarter of the year due to seasonality. The Company continues to pursue deposit growth initiatives aimed at product promotions, as well as increasing our presence in specific markets within our footprint.
Asset Quality
Annualized net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2006 were 0.12% of average loans, up from 0.10% in the second quarter of 2006 and down from 0.27% in the third quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $36.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to $29.1 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $76.7 million in the third quarter of 2005. Nonperforming assets were $633.8 million, or 0.52% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of September 30, 2006 compared to $369.8 million, or 0.31% of loans, other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of June 30, 2006. The increase in nonperforming assets from the second quarter of 2006 was mainly driven by the previously disclosed large commercial loan being placed on nonperforming status during the third quarter.
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $25.5 million to $1,087.3 million as of September 30, 2006 from $1,061.9 million as of June 30, 2006 primarily due to the build-out of the specific reserve allocated to the large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status during the third quarter. Provision expense increased from $51.8 million in the second quarter of 2006 to $61.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of September 30, 2006 represented 0.90% of period-end loans, up two basis points from 0.88% of period-end loans as of June 30, 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of September 30, 2006 represented 186% of period-end nonperforming loans.
 
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Retail
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Retail's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $189.7 million, an increase of $19.9 million, or 12%. The increase was primarily the result of deposit growth, widening deposit spreads and lower net charge-offs partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $34.1 million, or 6%. The increase was attributable to deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases as well as the increasing value of lower cost deposits in a higher rate environment. Average loans decreased $14.1 million, or 0%, while average deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 6%. The loan decrease was driven primarily by student loan sales, which totaled approximately $3.0 billion since September 30, 2005, and a decline in consumer indirect loans partially offset by growth in home equity loans and lines. Deposit growth was driven primarily by certificates of deposit while money market and NOW accounts drove the increase in spreads.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $10.0 million, or 27%, primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $6.9 million, or 3%. The increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes and gains on student loan sales.
Total noninterest expense increased $23.0 million, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2005. The increase was driven primarily by increases in personnel expense and operation costs related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology. 52 net new branches have been added over the past year.

Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $173.5 million, or 11%. The increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and widening deposit spreads due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases as well as the increasing value of lower cost deposits in a higher rate environment. Average loans increased $715.1 million, or 2%, and average deposits increased $4.0 billion, or 6%. The loan growth was driven by home equity loans and lines offset by student loan sales.

Total noninterest expense increased $88.1 million, or 6%. The increase was driven by increases in personnel expense and operation costs related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology.
Commercial
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Commercial's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $108.7 million, an increase of $18.3 million, or 20%. The increase was driven primarily by loan and deposit growth and lower net charge-offs.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $8.2 million, or 4%. The increase was attributable to increased loan and deposit growth. Average loans increased $1.9 billion, or 6%, with the strongest growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $388.1 million, or 3%, driven by an increase in institutional and government deposits partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market accounts.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $13.8 million, or 89%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower net charge-offs in the Core Commercial and Real Estate Finance Group ("REFG") sub-lines of business.
Total noninterest income decreased $1.7 million, or 2%. The decrease resulted from lower sales and referral credits and trading account profits and was partially offset by increases in deposit sweep income and other income in affordable housing.
Total noninterest expense decreased $7.3 million, or 4%. A decrease in affordable housing expense was in part offset by an increase in personnel expense.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Commercial's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $325.3 million, an increase of $43.2 million, or 15%. The increase was driven primarily by net interest income and noninterest income growth and lower net charge-offs, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.

Total noninterest income increased $16.8 million, or 9%. The increase resulted from higher affordable housing revenues, sweep income and sales and referral credits.
 
Total noninterest expense increased $17.4 million, or 4%. Increases in personnel expense and operations cost were in part offset by a decrease in affordable housing expense.
Corporate and Investment Banking
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $52.7 million, a decrease of $10.4 million, or 16%. The decrease, driven by narrowing corporate banking loan spreads and lower capital markets income, was slightly offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $14.0 million, or 21%. The decrease was primarily due to narrowing corporate banking loan spreads. Average loans increased $833.4 million, or 5%, driven by increased usage of committed facilities.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $12.2 million, or 68%.
Total noninterest income decreased $24.9 million, or 15%. Increased operating lease revenue, along with stronger M&A advisory fees and merchant banking gains, were offset by lower derivative revenue as well as weaker performance due to deal timing in structured leasing and syndications.
Total noninterest expense decreased $9.5 million, or 8%. Lower personnel expense associated with the decreased capital markets revenue growth was the primary driver.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $186.8 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 9%. Adjusting net income by $15.7 million for the March 2005 divestiture of Receivables Capital Management ("RCM") assets, net income decreased 2%. The decrease in net income was driven by weakness in net interest income and capital markets revenue.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $12.7 million, or 7%. The decrease was primarily due to narrowing corporate banking loan spreads. In addition, the divestiture of RCM assets in the first quarter of 2005 negatively impacted growth in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income. Average loans increased $1.5 billion, or 10%, and average deposits increased $20.8 million, or 1%. Loan growth was due to increased usage of committed facilities and corporate demand.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $12.3 million, or 71%.
Total noninterest income decreased $36.9 million, or 7%, driven primarily by the divestiture of RCM assets in the first quarter of 2005. Growth in debt capital markets, primarily driven by securitization, derivatives and structured leasing, was partially offset by weakness in merger and acquisition and merchant banking fees.
Total noninterest expense decreased $5.7 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower personnel expense associated with the decreased capital markets revenue growth.
 
Mortgage
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Mortgage's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $65.4 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 20%. Gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights and loan growth drove the increase, partially offset by decreased secondary marketing income and higher expense related to growth of the business.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $16.3 million, or 12%, principally due to growth in loans and increased deposit spreads, partially offset by lower income on loans held for sale. Average loans increased $6.8 billion, or 27%. This growth primarily came from residential mortgage and residential construction loans which contributed $21.7 million to the net fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increase. Average loans held for sale increased $1.6 billion, or 21%. However, compressed spreads resulting from increased short-term interest rates reduced income on loans held for sale by $8.8 million, or 20%. Average deposits were up $61.4 million, or 3%, due to escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances. The higher balances combined with a higher credit for funds rate contributed $6.6 million to the increase.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $2.2 million, or 75%.
Total noninterest income increased $14.9 million, or 18%. Production income was down $15.7 million, or 24%, due to lower loan production and narrower margins. Loan production was $13.7 billion, down $1.0 billion, or 7%. Loan sales to investors were $9.9 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 24%. Servicing income increased $31.6 million due to $23.9 million in gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights and increased fee income due to higher servicing balances. Slightly higher MSR amortization partially offset these increases. At September 30, 2006 total loans serviced were $124.8 billion compared with $97.4 billion the prior year, an increase of $27.4 billion, or 28%.
Total noninterest expense increased $17.0 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2005. Increased investments in production and servicing capabilities were the primary drivers of the higher expense.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Mortgage's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $208.5 million, an increase of $79.9 million, or 62%. This increase was principally a result of higher production driving higher fee and secondary marketing income, and sales of mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by higher expense related to growth of the business.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $57.7 million, or 15%, principally due to growth in loans and increased deposit spreads offset by lower income on loans held for sale. Average loans increased $7.6 billion, or 33%, contributing $72.3 million to the increase. The growth primarily came from residential mortgage and residential construction loans. Average loans held for sale were up $2.1 billion, or 32%; however, compressed spreads resulting from increased short-term interest rates reduced income by $27.3 million, or 22%. Average deposits increased $151.3 million, or 9%, due to
 
escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances. These balances combined with a higher credit for funds rate contributed $18.8 million to the increase.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $1.1 million, or 16%.
Total noninterest income increased $139.6 million, or 78%. Production income of $171.0 million was up $58.3 million, or 52%, driven by higher loan production and increased secondary marketing deliveries. Year-to-date loan production was $40.3 billion compared with $34.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion, or 17%. Loan sales to investors were $30.9 billion, up $10.6 billion, or 52%. Servicing income of $111.2 million was up $84.4 million due to gains from the sale of mortgage servicing assets of $66.0 million and increased fees from higher servicing balances.
Total noninterest expense increased $73.5 million, or 20%. Increased volume and investments in production and servicing capabilities were the primary drivers of the increase.
Wealth and Investment Management
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $117.9 million, an increase of $64.8 million, or 122%. The growth was primarily driven by the $69.9 million after-tax net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. Excluding the net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business, net income was down $5.1 million, or 10%.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $4.7 million, or 5%, due primarily to higher deposit spreads. Average loans increased $0.2 billion, or 3%, driven primarily by commercial loan demand. Average deposits decreased $0.1 billion, or 1 %, due to declines in demand deposits, money market deposits, and NOW deposits, partially offset by increased certificates of deposit and savings deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $1.1 million, or 61%.
Total noninterest income increased $118.0 million, or 50%, attributable largely to the $112.8 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. Noninterest income excluding the net gain increased 2%. Trust income increased as a result of higher assets under management and retail investment services income. Noninterest income growth was somewhat offset by a decline in insurance revenue, due in part to the December 31, 2005 sale of Carswell Insurance, and the funds flowing out of certain products whose investment strategies have been out of favor in the marketplace.
End of period assets under management were approximately $138.6 billion compared to $133.6 billion in the same period last year. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $238.5 billion,
 
which includes $138.6 billion in assets under management, $53.2 billion in non-managed trust assets, $36.7 billion in retail brokerage assets and $10.0 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets. Approximately $21.2 billion in corporate trust non-managed assets were transferred to the buyer of the Bond Trustee business.
Total noninterest expense increased $20.7, or 9%. The growth was primarily driven by continuing efforts to build-out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expenses.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $216.5 million, an increase of $71.8 million, or 50%. The growth was driven primarily by the $69.9 million after-tax net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. Excluding the net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business, net income increased $1.8 million, or 1%.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $28.6 million, or 12%, and was attributable to a combination of increased loan volumes and widening deposit spreads. Average loans increased $0.4 billion, or 5%, mainly due to growth in consumer mortgages, commercial real estate and commercial loans. Average deposits decreased $0.3 billion, or 3%, due to declines in demand deposits, NOW deposits and money market deposits, partially offset by increases in certificates of deposit.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $1.4 million, or 45%.
Total noninterest income increased $142.3 million, or 20%, primarily due to the $112.8 million pre-tax net gain on the sale of the Bond Trustee business. Noninterest income excluding the net gain increased 4%. Trust income increased due to growth in assets under management. Retail investment income increased due to increases in annuity, managed account and new business revenues. Noninterest income growth was somewhat offset by a decline in insurance revenue, due in part to the December 31, 2005 sale of Carswell Insurance, and the funds flowing out of certain products whose investment strategies have been out of favor in the marketplace.
Total noninterest expense increased $58.1 million, or 8%. Growth was primarily driven by continuing efforts to build-out the line of business including higher structural, staff and operations expenses.
Corporate Other and Treasury
 
Three Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $1.2 million, a decrease of $78.7 million, or 98%, mainly due to an increase in net securities losses due to the investment portfolio restructuring, a decline in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase in provision for loan losses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $51.2 million, or 53%. The main drivers for reduction were a $2.0 billion decrease in average securities available for sale and a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial
 
loan portfolio. Short-term borrowing costs also increased due to the need to fund earning asset growth, as well as the significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
Total average deposits increased $9.7 billion, or 53%, mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $30.5 million. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to the build-out of the specific reserve allocated to the large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status during the third quarter.
Total noninterest income decreased $86.7 million mainly due to an increase in securities losses of $89.5 million related to the investment portfolio restructuring.
Total noninterest expense decreased $15.4 million mainly due to a reduction in merger-related expenses.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $91.1 million, a decrease of $138.9 million, or 60%, mainly due to a decline in fully taxable-equivalent net interest income, an increase in provision for loan losses and an increase in securities losses partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $175.9, or 53%. The main drivers were a $2.0 billion decrease in average securities available for sale and a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio. Short-term borrowing costs also increased due to the need to fund earning asset growth, as well as the significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
Total average deposits increased $10.6 billion, or 67%, mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $77.4 million. The increase in provision expense was primarily due to loan growth generated during the period and the build-out of the specific reserve allocated to the large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status during the third quarter.
Total noninterest income decreased $70.5 million mainly due to an increase in securities losses of $76.6 million related to the investment portfolio restructuring in the third quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest expense decreased $69.1 million mainly due to a reduction in merger-related expenses.
