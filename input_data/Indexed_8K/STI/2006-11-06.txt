In connection with the closing of the issuance of the 5.853% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Preferred Purchase Securities (the "Transaction") of SunTrust Preferred Capital I (the "Normal PPS"), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (the "RCC") on October 25, 2006. Under the RCC, the Company covenanted in favor of certain of its debtholders, who are initially the holders of the Initial Covered Debt (as defined in the RCC), that, if the Company or a subsidiary repurchases or redeems any Normal PPS or Stripped PPS (as defined in the Prospectus) prior to the Stock Purchase Date (as defined in the Prospectus) or any Normal PPS or Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, no par value and $100,000 liquidation preference per share thereafter, the Company or its subsidiaries will do so only to the extent that the total redemption or repurchase price is equal to or less than designated percentages of the net cash proceeds that the Company or its subsidiaries have received during the 180 days prior to such redemption or repurchase from the issuance of other securities or combinations of securities that have equal or better equity characteristics than the PPS and qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies. The Initial Covered Debt (as defined in the RCC) is the Company's 6% Subordinated Notes due 2026, which have a CUSIP No. 867914AH6. A copy of the RCC is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The RCC is dated effective October 25, 2006, but was not executed by the Company until November 6, 2006, when final approval of the terms of the RCC was received from rating agencies and other regulatory authorities.
