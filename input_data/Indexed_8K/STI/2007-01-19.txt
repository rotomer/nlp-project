News Release
 
For Immediate Release
January 19, 2007
 
 
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported record earnings for 2006. For the full-year of 2006, net income available to common shareholders was a record $2,134.8 million, up 7% from $1,987.2 million in 2005, and net income per average common diluted share was $5.88, up 7% from $5.47 in 2005. Net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $523.6 million, up 1% from $518.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income per average common diluted share was $1.46, up 2% from $1.43 in the fourth quarter of 2005.
"Despite the challenging operating environment in 2006 and in particular the second-half of the year we were able to grow our earnings per share by 7% over 2005. Loans, deposits and our customer base continued to grow in 2006, reflective of our intense focus on sales and client service. As the year progressed and market conditions became increasingly difficult, we were able to offset the negative impact this had on net interest income with strong fee income growth and by ratcheting up expense control. We also instituted our efficiency and productivity program in the second half of 2006, which will yield significant benefits over the next several years. The efficiency and productivity initiatives, coupled with our sales and service focus and strong credit culture, should provide momentum going into 2007 and beyond," James M. Wells III, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust noted. Mr. Wells became the Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2007, succeeding L. Phillip Humann, who remains the Executive Chairman of the Company.
In connection with reporting its 2006 earnings, SunTrust detailed its company-wide efficiency and productivity initiative, named "E
2
(pronounced E-squared)  Excellence in Execution." The E
2
initiative, which encompasses both existing and planned efforts, involves identifying and realizing efficiency and productivity opportunities related to corporate real estate, supplier management, offshoring and outsourcing, process reengineering and a structured organizational review. SunTrust's estimate of cost saves attributable to the E
2
initiative is $400 million by the end of 2009. The goal for cost saves in 2007 is $135 million.
"The E
2
program complements our well-established focus on sales, cross-sales and the optimal client experience. We are confident that SunTrust will emerge from the program as a more efficient and productive organization and that our sales and client experience successes coupled with enhanced efficiency and productivity will create powerful operating leverage for the future," Mr. Wells said.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Consolidated Highlights
 
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,067.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding net securities gains and losses, the increase was 1%. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent revenue increased 7% from the third quarter of 2006. Excluding net securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business in the third quarter of 2006, the increase was 4%.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $8,216.8 million, up 5% from the same period in 2005. Excluding net securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM assets and the corporate Bond Trustee business, the increase was also 5%.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,185.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2005. The lack of growth was mainly the result of the flat to inverted yield curve that has persisted over this timeframe, as well as the continued shift in deposit mix away from lower-cost deposit products to consumer and other time deposits. On a sequential annualized basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased 4% from the third quarter of 2006. Net interest margin increased one basis point from the third quarter of 2006 to 2.94%. These increases were mainly a result of the $3 billion investment portfolio restructuring that occurred in the third quarter and strong growth in NOW accounts during the fourth quarter at rates that were advantageous compared to the wholesale funding rates they replaced. Partially offsetting these increases was the continued shift in deposit mix towards higher cost products, mainly consumer and other time deposits, and the negative impact the flat to inverted yield curve has had on the spread between incremental earning asset growth and the cost of funding the growth.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $4,748.4 million, up 2% from the same period in 2005. In addition to the aforementioned factors, loan growth also contributed to the increase.
 
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $882.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding net securities gains and losses, the increase was 6%. The increase primarily resulted from double-digit growth in mortgage production-related income, retail investment services income, investment banking income and card fees. These increases were offset primarily by declines in trading account profits and commissions and mortgage servicing-related income. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest income increased 11% from the third quarter of 2006. Excluding net securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business in the third quarter of 2006, the increase was 4%. The increase was driven mainly by growth in investment banking and retail investment services income as well as other charges and fees, partially offset primarily by decreases in mortgage servicing-related income and trading account profit and commissions.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, noninterest income was $3,468.4 million, up 10% from the same period in 2005. Excluding net securities gains and losses and the net gain on the sale of RCM assets and the corporate Bond Trustee business, the increase was 9%. The growth was driven mainly by mortgage production and servicing-related income, card fees, retail investment services income, investment banking income and trust and investment management income offset by decreases in trading account profit and commissions and service charges on deposit accounts.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1,233.8 million, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2005. This included an $11.7 million loss on the extinguishment of debt related to trust preferred debt that was called during the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase in expense reflects certain investments in revenue producing divisions of the Company, including the addition of offices and employees and investment in the infrastructure of the organization to gain greater efficiencies in the future. These increases were offset by decreased marketing and customer development expenses, lower amortization of intangible assets and the absence of merger expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. On a sequential annualized basis, noninterest expense increased 9% from the third quarter of 2006. Excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt, the increase was 6%. The increase was mainly due to a seasonal increase in marketing and customer development expense and divestiture-related expenses associated with affordable housing properties in the fourth quarter.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, total noninterest expense was $4,879.9 million, up 4% from the same period of 2005. Excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt and merger expense, the increase was 6%. The factors driving the increase were similar to those noted for the fourth quarter of 2006 increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Increasingly effective expense control slowed the rate of expense growth during 2006. For the first six months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005, noninterest expense excluding merger expense grew 10%, and for the last six months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005, noninterest expense excluding the loss on extinguishment of debt and merger expense grew only 3%.
Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 2006, SunTrust had total assets of $182.2 billion. Shareholders' equity of $17.8 billion as of December 31, 2006 represented 10% of total assets. Book value per common share was $48.85 as of December 31, 2006.
 
Loans
Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $121.4 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2005. Areas driving the growth were residential real estate and construction lending. On a sequential annualized basis, average loans grew 2% from the third quarter of 2006. Residential real estate and construction lending were the primary drivers of the growth, although to a lesser degree than in previous quarters. This is the result of an intentional reduction in the amount of mortgage production committed to the loan portfolio as well as the effect of slowing market trends that have developed in the construction sector. Despite slowing conditions that have affected the residential real estate market, the Company posted record mortgage production and application volumes in the fourth quarter.
On a full-year basis, average loans grew 10% over the same period in 2005, driven by strong double-digit growth in residential real estate, home equity, and construction lending, as well as commercial and commercial real estate lending to a lesser degree.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $98.6 billion, up 3% from the fourth quarter of 2005. On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits grew 4% from the third quarter of 2006. The full-year average consumer and commercial deposit growth was also 4% over the same period of 2005. The growth in deposits both year-over-year and on a sequential annualized basis was driven by growth in consumer time and other deposits. Given market conditions and the higher-rate environment, customer preference is for higher-yielding products. This is driving the continuation of the deposit mix shift away from lower-rate products, such as demand deposits, toward higher-rate products, such as time deposits or other alternative investment products that pay higher-rates. Such products include securities sold under agreement to repurchase and off-balance sheet products, such as money market mutual funds.
The Company continues to pursue deposit growth initiatives aimed at product promotions, as well as increasing our presence in specific markets within our footprint.
Capital
The Company completed a capital restructuring program in the second-half of 2006 that involved replacing higher-cost capital with more efficient and cost-effective hybrid capital structures, as well as calling higher-cost, capital inefficient trust preferred securities and replacing them with lower-cost, more efficient enhanced trust preferred securities. The proceeds from the hybrid capital issuances, totaling approximately $1 billion, were used to repurchase $1 billion in common stock, with $871 million repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase initiated in October and the other $126 million through in-market purchases in the third quarter of 2006.
These initiatives have contributed to higher tier 1 capital and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios. The tier 1 capital ratio improved an estimated 64 basis points from December 31, 2005 to approximately 7.65% as of December 31, 2006, and the tangible equity to tangible asset ratio improved 49 basis points to 6.05% over the same period.
Asset Quality
Annualized net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2006 were 0.29% of average loans, up from 0.12% in the third quarter of 2006 and 0.17% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net charge-offs were $89.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $36.1 million in the third quarter of 2006 and $49.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in net charge-offs was largely due to a charge-off taken in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006. Net charge-offs were 0.15% for the full-year of 2006, an improvement from the 2005 level of 0.18%.
 
Nonperforming loans were $662.3 million, or 0.55% of total loans as of December 31, 2006 compared to $585.4 million, or 0.48% of total loans as of September 30, 2006 and $296.4 million, or 0.26% of total loans as of December 31, 2005. The increase in nonperforming loans from the fourth quarter of 2005 was mainly due to the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006 and an increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans. The increase from the third quarter of 2006 was mainly due to the increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans. The increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans was driven mainly by maturation of this portfolio, and more specifically in well-collateralized conforming and Alt-A first mortgage loans. A significant portion of the remaining growth in nonperforming loans was attributable to insured second-lien products.
The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $14.0 million to $1,073.3 million as of December 31, 2006 from $1,087.3 million as of September 30, 2006 due in part to the reduction in the specific reserve that resulted from the charge-off taken in the fourth quarter associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006. Provision expense increased from $61.6 million in the third quarter of 2006 to $75.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2006 represented 0.88% of period-end loans, down two basis points from 0.90% of period-end loans as of September 30, 2006. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2006 represented 162% of period-end nonperforming loans.
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $45.2 million from December 31, 2005 as a result of the strong loan growth in 2006 in addition to the impact of the establishment of a specific reserve related to the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006.
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Retail
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Retail's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $166.3 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 1%. The decrease was primarily the result of lower noninterest income partially offset by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $4.6 million, or 1%. The increase was attributable to widening loan spreads due to a favorable change in loan mix. Average loans decreased $242.2 million, or 1%. The loan decrease was driven primarily by student loan sales and securitizations, which totaled approximately $3.1 billion throughout 2006. Further, a decline in consumer indirect was partially offset by growth in the higher-spread home equity products. Average deposits increased $3.1 billion, or 5%, driven primarily by consumer time deposits.
Total noninterest income decreased $10.7 million, or 4%, driven primarily by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts due to the continued growth of free checking account products and a decrease in consumer NSF fees.
Total noninterest expense decreased $6.7 million, or 1%. The decrease was driven primarily by declines in intangible amortization and operations expense.
 
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Retail's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $750.5 million, an increase of $105.2 million, or 16%. The increase was primarily the result of loan and deposit growth, wider deposit spreads, and lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $178.0 million, or 8%. Part of the increase was attributable to loan and deposit growth and a favorable change in the loan mix. Average loans increased $473.8 million, or 2%, primarily driven by growth in home equity products offset by a decline in student loans due to sales and securitizations during 2006. Average deposits increased $3.8 billion, or 6%, driven primarily by consumer time deposits. Wider deposit spreads also contributed to the increase in net interest income. Deposit spreads widened due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases, as well as the increasing value of lower-cost deposits in a higher rate environment.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $32.3 million, or 23%, primarily due to a decline in consumer indirect net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $26.8 million, or 3%. The increase was driven primarily by interchange income due to increased volumes, as well as gains on student loan sales.
Total noninterest expense increased $80.4 million, or 4%. The increase was driven by increases in interchange expense due to increased volume, as well as personnel and operations expense related to investments in the branch distribution network and technology. Forty-four net new branches were added during 2006.
Commercial
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Commercial's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $107.0 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 8%. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in noninterest income and lower provision for loan losses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was nearly unchanged, as an increase in net interest income on loans was offset by a shift to higher-cost deposits. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, with the strongest growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $422.2 million, or 3%, driven by an increase in institutional and government deposits, partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market accounts.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $4.6 million, or 65%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower net charge-offs in the Core Commercial sub-line of business.
Total noninterest income increased $7.2 million, or 10%. The increase was due mainly to higher revenue from capital markets activities, deposit sweep income and service charges on deposits.
Total noninterest expense increased $1.1 million, or 1%. An increase in personnel expense was partially offset by a decrease in operations expense.
 
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Commercial's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $432.9 million, an increase of $52.0 million, or 14%. The increase was primarily driven by net interest and noninterest income growth and lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $44.8 million, or 5%. The increase was driven by loan and deposit growth, as well as wider deposit spreads. Average loans increased $1.7 billion, or 5%, with the strongest growth in construction lending. Average deposits increased $378.5 million, or 3%, driven by an increase in institutional and government deposits and partially offset by decreases in demand deposits and money market accounts. Deposit spreads increased due to the increasing value of lower-cost deposits in a higher rate environment.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $15.7 million, or 62%. The decrease was driven primarily by lower net charge-offs in the Core Commercial and the Real Estate Finance Group ("REFG") sub-lines of business.
Total noninterest income increased $23.9 million, or 9%. The increase resulted from higher Affordable Housing revenues, deposit sweep income, as well as increased revenue from capital markets and card products.
Total noninterest expense increased $18.5 million, or 3%. Increases in personnel and operations expense were partially offset by a decrease in Affordable Housing expense.
Corporate and Investment Banking
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $69.1 million, an increase of $3.6 million, or 6%. Strong growth in Debt Capital Markets income was offset by a decrease in loan spreads, higher provision for loan losses and noninterest expense.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $18.8 million, or 26%. The decrease is primarily due to a shift in loan mix to loans with narrower spreads within the Corporate Banking portfolio. Average loans increased $290.9 million, or 2%, driven by increased usage of committed facilities. Average deposits decreased $745.2 million, or 21%. The decline in deposits was led by a reduction in certain bid-category products that the line of business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased to $40.2 million from a net recovery of $2.4 million. The increase was largely due to a charge-off taken in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income increased $67.4 million, or 48%, primarily driven by robust Debt Capital Markets revenue growth of $58.7 million, or 150%, mainly related to securitization, derivatives, structured leasing and loan syndication. Strong revenue growth from merchant banking and leasing also contributed to this increase.
Total noninterest expense increased $9.0 million, or 8%. The majority of the increase was due to increased incentive-based compensation related to the increase in capital markets revenue, as well as increased expense related to merchant banking.
 
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $256.2 million, a decrease of $14.6 million, or 5%. Adjusting net income by $16.6 million for the March 2005 divestiture of Receivable Capital Management ("RCM") factoring assets, net income increased 1%. Strong growth in Debt Capital Markets was primarily offset by increased provision for loan losses, as well as a decrease in loan spreads.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $31.5 million, or 12%. Excluding the RCM divestiture, the decrease was 11%, primarily due to a shift in loan mix to loans with narrower spreads within the Corporate Banking portfolio. Average loans increased $1.2 billion, or 8%, primarily in Financial Institutions, Energy and US Diversified Groups. This increase was due to stronger corporate demand and revolver usage, as well as strong growth in our leasing products. Average deposits decreased $172.2 million, or 5%, led by a reduction in certain bid-category products that the line of business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $30.3 million to $45.1 million. The increase was largely due to a charge-off taken in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income increased $30.5 million, or 5%. Adjusting for the divestiture of RCM, noninterest income grew 10%. Debt Capital Markets revenue increased $64.2 million, or 28%, mainly related to securitization, derivatives and structured leasing, as well as strong revenue performance in merchant banking and leasing.
Total noninterest expense increased $3.4 million, or 1%, primarily driven by increased compensation related to increased capital markets revenue, as well as increased expense related to merchant banking.
Mortgage
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Mortgage's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $40.8 million, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 6%. Higher origination and servicing fees, net of increased expenses, only partially offset higher mortgage servicing rights amortization and reduced net secondary marketing performance.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $2.0 million, or 1%, due to loan and deposit growth more than offset by lower income on loans held for sale. Growth in residential mortgage and residential construction loans drove a $5.4 billion, or 20%, increase in total loans, which contributed $12.7 million to the change in net interest income. Average loans held for sale increased $0.4 billion, or 4%. However, compressed spreads resulting from increased short-term interest rates reduced income on loans held for sale by $16.3 million. Average deposits were up $0.2 billion, or 10%, due to higher escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances along with a higher credit for funds rate, and contributed $5.7 million to the change.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $4.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Mortgage realized net recoveries of $1.2 million compared to net charge-offs of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net charge-offs increased due to the maturation of the mortgage portfolio.
 
Total noninterest income was up $0.5 million, or 1%. Production income was up $12.2 million due to higher volumes. Record loan production of $15.1 billion was up $2.0 billion, or 15%. Loan sales to investors were a record $11.6 billion, up $4.2 billion, or 57%. Servicing income was down $4.4 million due to higher mortgage servicing rights amortization that was partially offset by higher fee income from increased servicing balances. At December 31, 2006, total loans serviced were $130.0 billion, up $24.4 billion, or 23%, from $105.6 billion at prior year-end. Other noninterest income was down $7.2 million due to increased secondary marketing reserves, partially offset by higher insurance income due to increased volumes.
Total noninterest expense increased $2.1 million, or 1%. Increased volumes and investments in production and servicing capabilities were the primary drivers of the slightly higher expense level.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Mortgage's net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $248.4 million, an increase of $76.5 million, or 45%. Income from sales of servicing assets, higher income from loans and deposits, better net secondary marketing performance, and higher origination and servicing fees, net of increased expense, were partially offset by increased mortgage servicing rights amortization.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $55.7 million, or 10%, principally due to loan and deposit growth partially offset by lower spreads on loans held for sale. Average loans, principally residential mortgage and residential construction loans, increased $7.0 billion, or 29%, contributing $85.0 million to the higher net interest income. Average loans held for sale increased $1.7 billion, or 23%. However, due to compressed spreads resulting from higher short-term interest rates, net interest income on loans held for sale declined $43.6 million. Average deposits were up $0.2 billion, or 10%, due to escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances along with a higher credit for funds rate, and contributed $24.5 million to the change.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $3.1 million, or 56%, due to the maturation of the mortgage portfolio.
Total noninterest income increased $140.1 million, or 59%. Production income was up $70.5 million driven by higher volumes. Production of $55.4 billion was up $7.7 billion, or 16%. Loan sales to investors were $40.9 billion, an increase of $13.2 billion, or 48%. Servicing income was up $80.0 million due to gains from the sale of mortgage servicing assets of $66.3 million and increased fees from higher servicing balances. Higher mortgage servicing rights amortization partially offset these increases. Other noninterest income was down $10.4 million due to higher secondary marketing reserves, partially offset by higher insurance income.
Total noninterest expense increased $75.6 million, or 15%. Increased volume and investments in production and servicing capabilities were the primary drivers of the higher expense level.
Wealth and Investment Management
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $51.1 million, an increase of $8.6 million, or 20%. The growth was primarily driven by growth in noninterest income partially offset by growth in noninterest expense and the forgone income that resulted from the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business at the end of the third quarter of 2006.
 
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $4.3 million, or 5%, due primarily to a shift in deposit mix to higher-cost products. Average loans increased $0.1 billion, or 1%, driven by modest growth in most categories, with the exception of consumer mortgages. Average deposits increased $0.6 billion, or 6%, due to increased NOW account balances and customer time deposits, partially offset by declines in demand and money market deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $3.8 million, or 65%.
Total noninterest income increased $12.6 million, or 5%, due to strong retail investment services income driven by revenue from managed accounts, 12b-1 fees and annuities. Conversely, trust income decreased primarily as a result of lost revenue from the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business and a decline in non-recurring revenue. End of period assets under management were approximately $141.1 billion compared to $135.3 billion end of period last year. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $245.3 billion, which includes $141.1 billion in assets under management, $57.7 billion in non-managed trust assets, $38.7 billion in retail brokerage assets and $7.8 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets. Approximately $21.2 billion in corporate trust non-managed assets were transferred as part of the corporate Bond Trustee transaction.
Total noninterest expense increased $2.0 million, or 1%. The growth was primarily driven by increased fees paid to third parties and partially offset by reduced operations and staff expenses, which are partially attributable to efficiency initiatives within the line of business.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $267.3 million, an increase of $80.1 million, or 43%. Excluding the net gain on the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business, net income increased 5%. Increases in both net interest income and non-interest income were partially offset by higher expenses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $24.3 million, or 7%, attributable to a combination of increased loan volumes and wider deposit spreads. Average loans increased $0.3 billion, or 4%, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and commercial loans. Average deposits decreased $0.1 billion, or 1%, due to declines in demand deposits and money market accounts, partially offset by increases in consumer time deposits. Deposit spreads widened due to deposit rate increases that have been slower relative to market rate increases, as well as the increasing value of lower-cost deposits in a higher rate environment.
Provision for loan losses, which represents net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $5.2 million, or 58%.
Total noninterest income increased $154.9 million, or 16%, primarily due to the $112.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the corporate Bond Trustee business. Noninterest income excluding the net gain of $112.8 million increased $42.1 million to $986.1 million, or 4%, driven by growth in trust and retail investment services income. Trust income increased due to growth in assets under management from improved sales and market conditions. Retail investment services income increased due to growth in variable annuities, managed account and new business revenue.
Total noninterest expense increased $60.1 million, or 6%. Growth was primarily driven by higher structural and staff expense.
 
Corporate Other and Treasury
 
 
Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $97.0 million, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 4%, mainly due to an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in provision for loan losses and an increase in noninterest income.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was nearly unchanged, decreasing $1.4 million, or 2%.
Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, decreased $12.1 million.
Total average assets decreased $2.1 billion, or 6%, mainly due to a reduction in the size of the investment portfolio of $1.7 billion that resulted from the investment portfolio restructuring in the third quarter. Total average deposits increased $4.9 billion, or 23%, mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits.
Total noninterest income increased $7.6 million, or 32%. This was mainly due to an increase in net securities gains of $31.7 million recognized in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a $13.5 million decrease in derivative income on economic hedges and an increase in intercompany credits to the lines of business of $5.7 million.
Total noninterest expense increased $19.2 million due mainly to the loss on extinguishment of debt totaling $11.7 million.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $187.2 million, a decrease of $144.0 million, or 43%, mainly due to a decline in net interest income, an increase in provision for loan losses, and increased net securities losses partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $177.3 million, or 44%. The main drivers were a $1.9 billion decrease in average securities available for sale, a decrease in income on receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps used to extend the duration of the commercial loan portfolio resulting from narrower spreads between the receive fixed/pay floating rates, an increase in short-term borrowing costs due to an increase in the size of these borrowings needed to fund earning asset growth, as well as a significant rise in short-term interest rates over the past year.
Total average deposits increased $9.2 billion, or 53%, mainly due to growth in brokered and foreign deposits.
Provision for loan losses, which represents the difference between net charge-offs for the lines of business and total provision for loan losses, increased $65.4 million due to additional provision expense necessary to support the Company's strong loan growth in 2006 and the impact of the establishment of a specific reserve related to the previously disclosed large commercial loan placed on nonperforming status in the third quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income decreased $62.9 million, mainly due to an increase in net securities losses of $44.8 million related to the portfolio restructuring in the third quarter of 2006 and a $14.0 million decrease in derivative income on economic hedges.
Total noninterest expense decreased $48.9 million mainly due to a reduction in merger-related expenses.
