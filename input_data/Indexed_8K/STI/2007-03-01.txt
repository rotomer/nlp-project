Item 8.01. Other Events
In its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 filed today, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Registrant") reported net income available to common shareholders of $2,109.7 million, or $5.82 per diluted common share, and $498.6 million or $1.39 per diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these results have been revised from the results the Registrant reported in its January 19, 2007 news release to reflect a subsequent event which affected certain estimates regarding a previously disclosed large commercial loan which has been on non-accrual status since August 2006. Subsequent to January 19, 2007 but before the Registrant filed its annual report, the obligor of such loan signed a definitive agreement to sell the majority of its assets to an unrelated third party at a sale price which differed materially from that estimated by the obligor and the Registrant on January 19, 2007. In connection with that sale, the obligor partially repaid the loan and the Registrant charged off the remainder.
The Registrant today issued a News Release addressing such matters generally, and a copy of such News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Registrant also discusses such matters more fully in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 (filed on March 1, 2007), particularly in the section "Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation."
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
For Immediate Release
March 1, 2007
ATLANTA  In its 2006 Form 10-K filed today, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) reported net income available to common shareholders of $2,109.7 million, or $5.82 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2006, SunTrust reported net income available to common shareholders of $498.6 million or $1.39 per diluted common share. These results have been revised from the earnings results the Company reported in its January 19, 2007 press release in which the Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2,134.8 million, or $5.88 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2006 and net income available to common shareholders of $523.6 million, or $1.46 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.
SunTrust said its revised results were prompted by developments that occurred in February 2007 in connection with resolution of a previously disclosed large commercial loan which has been on non-accrual status since August 2006. This resolution resulted in a $40 million increase in the provision for loan losses. The borrower, which has not been identified for reasons of customer confidentiality, signed a definitive agreement to sell the majority of its assets, primarily customer contracts, to an unrelated third party. In connection with that sale, the SunTrust loan was partially repaid and the remainder of the Company's exposure to this borrower, $69 million, was charged off.
SunTrust provided the financing to the purchaser. SunTrust believes the purchaser is financially stable and the new financing reflects market terms and conditions. Under the terms of the definitive sale agreement, the ultimate amount of repayment of a portion of the financing is contingent upon future performance of the purchased customer contracts in to the third quarter of 2007. Accordingly, SunTrust has temporarily classified approximately $31 million of the new financing as non-accrual and assigned a specific reserve based on the Company's projection of the actual repayment amount. SunTrust noted that nonperforming loans declined $131 million from the level reported January 19, 2007, as a result of the definitive agreement and new financing.
SunTrust management determined that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that it was appropriate to revise its 2006 financial statements since these events occurred prior to the filing of the Company's 2006 Form 10-K.
SunTrust emphasized that the revision to management's estimate subsequent to year end does not constitute a control deficiency. Rather, it is a reflection of the extremely fluid nature of the workout activities associated
with this particular loan which have now been essentially concluded, and specific events which took place subsequent to year end.
