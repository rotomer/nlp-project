On May 31, 2007, SunTrust Bank, our principal banking subsidiary, issued GBP 400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Registered Floating Rate Senior Bank Notes due 2012 (the "Floating Rate Notes"). SunTrust Bank pays interest on the Floating Rate Notes at the rate of 3-month GBP LIBOR plus 12 basis points. The Floating Rate Notes were issued to purchasers at a price of 100%, resulting in proceeds to SunTrust Bank, after dealer discount, of GBP 399,200,000. The Floating Rate Notes are not redeemable by SunTrust Bank (except in certain limited events) or subject to repayment at the option of the holder prior to maturity. The Floating Rate Notes will be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The Floating Rate Notes were issued as part of the program established November 8, 2000 and amended on November 21, 2006 under which SunTrust Bank may offer up to USD $20 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt obligations. With the issuance of the Floating Rate Notes, the cumulative balance of outstanding notes under the program is equivalent to approximately USD $7,455,820,000.
Copies of the Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement and the Amended and Restated Global Agency Agreement relating to this program, under which the Floating Rate Notes were issued, have been filed as Exhibit 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 21, 2006, the contents of which documents are incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference. The Registrant disclaims any inference regarding the materiality of such information which otherwise may arise as a result of its furnishing such information under Item 2.03 of this report on Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
