Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
July 19, 2007
 
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2007 of $673.9 million compared to $544.0 million in the second quarter of 2006. Net income per average common diluted share was $1.89 compared to $1.49 in the second quarter of 2006. The results included a $145.6 million after-tax gain on sale of 4.5 million shares, or 9%, of the Company's common stock holdings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coke). Excluding the gain on sale of Coke stock, net income available to common shareholders was $528.3 million, or $1.48 per average common diluted share, for the second quarter of 2007.
"We are pleased to report that our intensified and continuing focus on driving shareholder value contributed significantly to the Company's performance in the second quarter," said James M. Wells III, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust. Mr. Wells noted that the shareholder value initiatives helped deliver positive operating leverage for the quarter, with solid revenue growth and strong expense management helping to offset the impact of higher credit costs.
The Company's initiatives to drive shareholder value announced during the first half of this year include the E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program and balance sheet and capital management strategies. The E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program initiatives produced $51.8 million in cost savings for the second quarter of 2007, bringing the year-to-date cost savings to $80.6 million. The cost savings to date have primarily come from supplier management, offshoring/outsourcing, and process reengineering-related initiatives. Additional initiatives are either being implemented or are under review, and the expectation is that the program will produce $181 million in cost savings for the full year of 2007, $350 million in 2008, and $530 million in 2009, representing over 10% of the Company's current full-year expense base.
The balance sheet and capital management strategies initiated in the first half of this year have resulted in selling or replacing lower-yielding investment securities and mortgage loans with higher-yielding assets, de-levering the balance sheet, and using the resulting capital flexibility to repurchase shares through an accelerated share repurchase program and open-market purchases, which together totaled over $850 million in the second quarter. The Company's capital management strategies also included the partial liquidation of the Coke holdings during the second quarter and the evaluation of alternatives for the remaining 43.7 million shares.
Several of the Company's key financial performance measures improved as a result of these initiatives, as the return on assets and equity, net interest margin, and the efficiency ratio improved in the second quarter from the first quarter of 2007.
Second Quarter 2007 Consolidated Highlights
 
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,374.6 million for the second quarter of 2007, up 15% from the second quarter of 2006. Excluding the gain on Coke stock, fully taxable-equivalent revenue increased 4% driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. On a sequential annualized basis, excluding the gain on sale of Coke stock, fully taxable-equivalent revenue increased 14% from the first quarter of 2007.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $4,441.8 million, up 8% from the same period in 2006. Excluding the gain on Coke stock, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was up 2% from the six months ended June 30, 2006, also driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,220.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 3% from the second quarter of 2006. Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2007 was 3.10%, a 10 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2006. On a sequential annualized basis,
 
fully taxable-equivalent net interest income improved 11% from the first quarter of 2007. Net interest margin increased 8 basis points from the first quarter of 2007 marking the second consecutive 8 basis point sequential quarter improvement. The increases in both fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and net interest margin were driven mainly by the balance sheet management strategies executed in the first half of this year, which has resulted in improved yields on earning assets, as well as de-levering the balance sheet and reducing the level of higher-cost wholesale funding. Average earning asset yields increased 5 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2007, while average interest bearing liability costs remained flat.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2,408.2 million, up 1% from the same period in 2006 while the net interest margin remained flat at 3.06% for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. The stable fully taxable-equivalent net interest income and net interest margin over this period is mainly attributable to the balance sheet management strategies executed this year.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1,154.6 million for the second quarter of 2007, up 32% from the second quarter of 2006 driven in large part by the $234.8 million gain on sale of Coke stock. Noninterest income excluding the Coke stock gain increased 5%. The increase was driven by growth in several areas, including retail investment services, card fees, mortgage production and servicing-related income, and other noninterest income. Growth in retail investment services income was driven by strong annuity sales. Card fee growth was due to higher interchange fees. Mortgage production fee growth was driven by record mortgage production in the second quarter of nearly $18 billion, a 20% increase over the second quarter of 2006, nearly $3 billion of portfolio loans sold in the second quarter of 2007, and the election in the second quarter to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value under the provisions of SFAS 159, thereby alleviating the burdens and complexities of qualifying for hedge accounting on the mortgage warehouse. This election impacts the timing of recognition of origination fees and costs, as well as servicing value. Specifically, origination fees and costs, which had been deferred and recognized as part of the gain/loss on sale of the loan, are now recognized in earnings at time of origination. The servicing value, which had been recorded at the time the loan was sold, is now included in the fair value of the loan and recognized at origination. Mortgage servicing income increased primarily due to higher servicing fee income derived from a larger serving portfolio, partially offset by lower gains from servicing asset sales. The increase in other noninterest income was due mainly to gains generated on private equity investments and structured leasing transactions, including a $23.4 million gain on one private equity investment transaction. Net of related expenses, the pre-tax impact on income from the transaction totaled $19.3 million, or $12.0 million after-tax. Negatively impacting noninterest income was a decline in trading income due to negative market value adjustments on assets and liabilities carried at fair value, as well as a decline in trust income due to the merger of Lighthouse Partners into Lighthouse Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2007 and the sale of the corporate bond trustee business in the third quarter of 2006.
On a sequential annualized basis excluding the Coke stock gain, noninterest income increased 19% from the first quarter of 2007 due to similar reasons noted previously for the growth over the second quarter of 2006. In addition, strong growth occurred in investment banking income led by an increase in securitization fees. Other items of note were an $11.6 million gain on the sale of servicing rights that accounted for the increase in mortgage servicing-related income over the first quarter of 2007, as well as the impact of the fair value adoption in the first quarter on trading income and mortgage production-related income. This explains a majority of the variance in these two categories on a sequential annualized basis as trading income was positively impacted and mortgage production-related income was negatively impacted by the fair value adoption in the first quarter.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, noninterest income was $2,033.5 million, an increase of 18% from the same period in 2006. Excluding the gain on Coke stock, noninterest income increased 4% compared to the six months ended June 30, 2006. The factors contributing to the growth were similar to those noted for the growth over the same quarter of last year and on a sequential annualized basis.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2007 was $1,251.2 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter of 2007 expense level included the impact of the Company's election to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. Under this election, costs associated with the origination of mortgage loans held-for-sale are recognized as a component of compensation expense when the loan is originated. Prior to election, these costs were deferred and recognized as part of the gain/loss on sale of the loan. The impact of this election was to increase compensation expense by $12.4 million in the quarter. Also impacting the rate of expense growth was the reversal of a leverage lease-related reserve in the second quarter of 2006 that reduced noninterest expense by $10.9 million. Excluding the impact of these two items, expense growth was only 1%, demonstrating the impact the E
2
initiatives had on controlling expense growth. The initiatives generated $51.8 million of cost saves in the second quarter of 2007. Initial implementation costs associated with the E
2
initiatives totaled $12.4 million in the second quarter of 2007 and were offset by E
2
-related corporate real estate gains of $13.2 million in the quarter. On a sequential annualized basis, taking into account the impact of electing to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value, initial implementation costs associated with the E
2
initiative, and E
2
-related corporate real estate gains, expense growth was a modest 4%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, noninterest expense was $2,487.2 million, an increase of 2% compared to the same period in 2006. This increase was driven by initial implementation costs associated with E
2
initiatives totaling $26.2 million in 2007, partially offset by corporate real estate gains of $17.4 million, as well as the $12.4 million of compensation expense associated with electing to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value and the benefit of the leverage lease-related reserve reversal in 2006. Taking these items into account, expense growth was only 1% compared to the six months ended June 30, 2006. The E
2
initiatives have generated $80.6 million in cost savings for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2007, SunTrust had total assets of $180.3 billion. Shareholders' equity of $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2007, represented 10% of total assets. Book value per common share was $48.33 as of June 30, 2007.
Loans
Average loans for the second quarter of 2007 were $118.2 billion, down nearly $2 billion, or 2%, from the second quarter of 2006. The decline was due to balance sheet management strategies implemented since the second quarter of 2006 and accelerated in the first half of 2007. The strategies resulted in the sale of nearly $10 billion in loans over the past year, which included the sale of approximately $5.9 billion in mortgage loans, $1.8 billion in student loans, and $1.9 billion in corporate loans. Average loans were down $3.4 billion from the first quarter of 2007 due to $4.1 billion in mortgages moved to loans held-for-sale late in the first quarter and $1.9 billion of corporate loans sold in March. Taking into account the loan sales, the Company had underlying loan growth across most categories.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter of 2007 were $97.9 billion, up 1% from the second quarter of 2006. The increase in deposits was driven by growth in NOW accounts and consumer and other time deposits. The growth in these categories was offset by declines in demand deposit, money market, and savings account balances. Given market conditions and the higher-rate environment, customer preference has been for higher-yielding products. This demand has driven the continuation of the deposit mix shift away from lower-rate products, such as demand deposits, toward higher-rate products, such as time deposits or other alternative investment products with higher returns. The alternative investment products include securities sold under agreement to repurchase and off-balance sheet products,
 
such as STI Classic money market mutual funds. Total brokered and foreign deposits declined 12% from the second quarter of 2006, as the Company strategically reduced the size of its loan and securities portfolios thereby reducing reliance on these higher cost funding sources.
On a sequential annualized basis, average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1% from the first quarter of 2007, driven by an 8% sequential annualized increase in demand deposits. The Company continues to pursue deposit growth initiatives, as well as increasing our presence in specific markets within our footprint.
Capital
The tier 1 capital and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios increased as the Company took steps to improve these ratios over the past year, the most significant of which was the capital restructuring program executed in the second-half of 2006. The tier 1 capital ratio improved an estimated 19 basis points from June 30, 2006, to approximately 7.5% as of June 30, 2007, and the tangible equity to tangible asset ratio improved 4 basis points to 5.85% over the same period. Given the flexibility gained through the balance sheet management strategies executed in the first half of 2007, the Company repurchased 8.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $850 million through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open-market purchases during the second quarter. Under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement, which resulted in the repurchase of 8.0 million shares in the second quarter, the Company may receive up to 1.7 million additional shares at the expiration of the agreement's term, which is now expected to occur in late August of 2007, without additional payment. The number of additional shares will be based on the weighted average share price of SunTrust common stock between now and the expiration date.
Asset Quality
Annualized net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2007 were 0.30% of average loans, up from 0.10% in the second quarter of 2006 and 0.21% in the first quarter of 2007. Net charge-offs were $88.3 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $29.1 million in the second quarter of 2006 and $62.9 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in net charge-offs over the second quarter of 2006 reflects the normalization in the credit cycle from historically low net charge-offs experienced in the first half of 2006 in addition to the negative impact from deterioration in certain segments of the consumer real estate market. The increase in net charge-offs from both the second quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007 was most pronounced in the commercial, home equity, and residential mortgage categories.
Nonperforming loans were $764.6 million, or 0.64% of total loans as of June 30, 2007, compared to $327.3 million, or 0.27% of total loans as of June 30, 2006, and $665.1 million, or 0.57% of total loans as of March 31, 2007. The increase in nonperforming loans compared to both periods was mainly due to an increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans. The increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans was driven by the maturation of this portfolio and the deterioration of credit quality in Alt-A mortgage loans, of which the majority is well-collateralized or insured.
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $16.4 million from March 31, 2007, to $1,050.4 million as of June 30, 2007. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was mainly attributable to a $1.9 billion increase in period-end loans compared to March 31, 2007, and the deterioration in certain segments of the consumer real estate market, and resulted in a $48.2 million increase in provision for loan losses compared to the first quarter of 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2007, represented 0.88% of period-end loans consistent with March 31, 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2007, represented 137% of period-end nonperforming loans.
 
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The following discussion details results for SunTrust's five business lines: Retail, Commercial, Corporate and Investment Banking, Mortgage and Wealth and Investment Management. All revenue is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the lines of business, results include net interest income which is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing. Further, provision expense is represented by net charge-offs.
SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other and Treasury, which includes the Treasury department as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. This segment also includes differences created between internal management accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles, certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges, differences in provision expense compared to net charge-offs, as well as equity and its related impact.
Retail
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Retail's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $158.9 million, a decrease of $25.0 million, or 14%, compared to the second quarter of 2006. The decrease was primarily the result of lower net interest income and higher net charge-offs partially offset by higher noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased $10.0 million, or 2%, driven by the continued shift in deposit mix to higher-rate deposit products and a $795.9 million, or 1%, decline in average deposits. Specifically, increases in higher-cost time deposits and certain NOW account products were more than offset by declines in lower-cost money market and demand deposit balances, as customer preference continues to favor higher-yielding deposit products. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by a $1.2 billion, or 68%, decrease in average loans held-for-sale, as Retail has strategically decreased exposure in relatively low spread, third-party student loans. Positively impacting net interest income was a $1.1 billion, or 4%, increase in average loans driven by growth in home equity, business banking, and newly-originated student loans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in indirect auto loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $29.7 million reflecting normalization of the credit cycle from historically low net charge-offs experienced in the first half of 2006 in addition to the negative impact from deterioration in certain segments of the consumer real estate market. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2006 was most pronounced in home equity products.
Total noninterest income increased $1.9 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2006. This increase was driven primarily by increases in interchange income driven by higher transaction volume and increases in service charges on deposit accounts due to higher collection rates. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of student loans.
Total noninterest expense increased $2.6 million, or 1%, from the second quarter of 2006. Increases in personnel expense related to investments in the branch distribution network and business banking were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of core deposit intangibles.
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Retail's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was $320.1 million, a decrease of $34.7 million, or 10%, compared to the same period in 2006. The decrease was primarily the result of lower net interest income and higher net charge-offs.
Net interest income decreased $9.1 million, or 1%, driven by the continued shift in deposit mix to higher-rate deposit products. Average deposits increased $630.7 million, or 1%, as increases in higher-cost time deposits and certain NOW account products were partially offset by declines in lower-cost money market and demand deposit balances, as customer preference continues to favor higher-yielding deposit products. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by a $1.0 billion, or 58%, decrease in average loans held-for-sale, as Retail has strategically decreased exposure in relatively low spread, third-party student loans. Positively impacting net interest income was a $569.9 million, or 2%, increase in average loans driven by growth in home equity and business banking loans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in indirect auto and student loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $55.0 million reflecting normalization of the credit cycle from historically low net charge-offs experienced in the first half of 2006 in addition to the negative impact from deterioration in certain segments of the consumer real estate market. The increase compared to the first half of 2006 was most pronounced in home equity products.
Total noninterest income increased $3.4 million, or 1%. This increase was driven primarily by increases in interchange income driven by higher transaction volume and increases in service charges on deposit accounts due to higher collection rates. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of student loans.
Total noninterest expense decreased $4.8 million, or less than 1%. Decreases in amortization of core deposit intangibles, new loan production expense, and shared corporate expenses were partially offset by an increase in personnel expense related to investments in the branch distribution network and business banking.
Commercial
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Commercial's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $100.6 million, a decrease of $6.5 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased $12.6 million, or 5%, as the continued shift in deposit mix to higher-rate products decreased net interest income $11.4 million. The compression in deposit spreads was primarily due to a decrease in demand deposits, as customers redeployed liquidity in the current rate environment to higher-yielding NOW account and off-balance sheet sweep products. Total average deposits increased $634.2 million, or 5%, as increases in institutional and government deposits were partially offset by decreases in lower-cost demand deposits and money market accounts. Average loans increased $436.7 million, or 1%, resulting in a $0.6 million increase in net interest income. The average loan growth was most prominent in construction and commercial lending products.
Provision for loan losses increased $1.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2006.
Total noninterest income increased $3.4 million, or 5%, driven by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and other miscellaneous income, partially offset by a decrease in business credit card income.
 
Total noninterest expense decreased $2.6 million, or 2%. Decreases in various discretionary expenses, credit and collection services expenses, and shared corporate expenses were partially offset by increased Affordable Housing-related expenses.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Commercial's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was $198.8 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest income and lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income decreased $20.2 million, or 4%, as the continued shift in deposit mix to higher-rate deposit products decreased net interest income $20.7 million. The compression in deposit spreads was primarily due to a decrease in demand deposits, as customers redeployed liquidity in the current rate environment to higher-yielding NOW account and off-balance sheet sweep products. Total average deposits increased $577.1 million, or 4%, as increases in institutional and government deposits were partially offset by decreases in lower-cost demand deposits and money market accounts. Average loans increased $836.6 million, or 3%, resulting in a $3.7 million increase in net interest income. The average loan growth was most prominent in construction lending products.
Provision for loan losses increased $5.2 million, or 93%, compared to the same period in 2006. The increase was most prominent in commercial loan products.
Total noninterest income increased $3.3 million, or 2%, driven by increases in service charges on deposits, other miscellaneous income, and higher Bankcard and Capital Markets referral revenue, partially offset by a decrease in business credit card income.
Total noninterest expense decreased $4.2 million, or 1%. Decreases in various discretionary expenses, credit and collection services expenses, and shared corporate expenses were partially offset by increased Affordable Housing-related expenses.
Corporate and Investment Banking
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $66.1 million, an increase of $3.7 million, or 6%. The increase was primarily driven by higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and net charge-offs.
Net interest income decreased $3.8 million, or 7%, due to a decrease in average loans and compression of deposit spreads. Average loan balances decreased $1.2 billion, or 7%, as the impact of a $1.9 billion structured asset sale of corporate loans in the first quarter of 2007 was partially offset by growth in corporate banking loans and lease financing assets. Average deposits decreased $219.2 million, or 7%, driven by lower demand deposits. Partially offsetting the decline in net interest income due to decreased loans and deposits was an increase driven by capital markets trading assets at improved spreads.
Provision for loan losses increased to $14.6 million from a net recovery of $0.4 million. The increase was mainly in the corporate banking and leasing portfolios.
Total noninterest income increased $39.9 million, or 25%, mainly driven by private equity investment gains and syndication, primary bond, structured leasing, and securitization activities. One private equity investment transaction generated a $23.4 million gain, and net of related expenses, the pre-tax impact on income was $19.3 million. These increases were partially offset by lower fixed income trading revenue.
 
Total noninterest expense increased $15.2 million, or 13%, driven by increased incentive-based compensation due to increased revenue and the reversal of the leveraged lease-related reserve in the second quarter of 2006. This increase was partially offset by lower shared corporate expenses.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Corporate and Investment Banking's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was $109.3 million, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 8%. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by growth in noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased $19.2 million, or 15%, as a decrease in average loans and compression of deposit spreads resulted in a $16.7 million decline in net interest income. Average loan balances decreased $445.0 million, or 3%, as the impact of a $1.9 billion structured asset sale of corporate loans in the first quarter of 2007 was partially offset by growth in corporate banking loans and lease financing assets. Average deposits decreased $547.4 million, or 16%, as a result of lower demand deposit balances and a reduction in certain bid-category products the business elected not to bid on due to their high cost in relation to alternative funding sources. This led to net interest income compression from deposits of $3.6 million. Positively impacting net interest income was an increase in capital markets trading assets at improved spreads.
Provision for loan losses increased to $16.9 million from a net recovery of $0.8 million. The increase was mainly in the corporate banking and leasing portfolios.
Total noninterest income increased $29.1 million, or 9%, mainly driven by private equity investment gains and primary bond and syndication activities. One private equity investment transaction generated a $23.4 million gain, and net of related expenses, the pre-tax impact on income was $19.3 million. These increases were partially offset by lower income from fixed income trading, equity offerings, M&A, and securitization activities.
Total noninterest expense increased $8.2 million, or 3%, driven by increased incentive-based compensation due to increased revenue and the reversal of the leveraged lease-related reserve in the second quarter of 2006. This increase was partially offset by lower shared corporate expenses.
Mortgage
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs 2006
Mortgage's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $42.1 million, a decrease of $19.8 million, or 32%, compared to the second quarter of 2006. The decline was driven by narrower secondary marketing margins, losses associated with prior Alt-A product originations, lower income from sales of servicing assets, and higher volume-related expense. Positively impacting net income were higher fee income from record production, record loan sales, and a larger servicing portfolio.
Net interest income decreased $13.9 million, or 9%, driven primarily by decreases in average loans held-for-investment and compression of loan spreads which resulted in an $18.3 million decline in net interest income. Average loans, primarily residential mortgage and residential construction loans, declined $2.6 billion, or 8%, due to balance sheet management strategies initiated in the second half of 2006 and accelerated in the first half of 2007. Average loans held-for-sale increased $4.9 billion, or 65%, however, due to compressed spreads, net interest income declined $0.6 million. The increase in average loans held-for-sale was primarily due to the first quarter transfer of $4.1 billion of portfolio loans to the held for sale
 
category. Average deposits were up $0.5 billion, or 29%, due to growth in escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances and positively impacted net interest income $7.1 million.
Provision for loan losses increased $10.9 million primarily due to higher Alt-A loan charge-offs. The Company is no longer originating Alt-A products for the held for investment portfolio.
Total noninterest income increased $36.6 million, or 36%, due to higher mortgage production and servicing income. The $5.5 million increase in mortgage production income was driven by record production and delivery volumes, partially offset by narrower secondary margins and higher losses, largely attributable to prior Alt-A production. Production volume of $18.0 billion was an increase of 19% and sales volumes of $14.2 billion was an increase of 46% over the second quarter of 2006. Mortgage production income was also favorably impacted by the election in May 2007 to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value under the provisions of SFAS 159, which alleviated the burdens and complexities of qualifying for hedge accounting on the mortgage warehouse. This election impacts the timing of recognition of origination fees and costs, as well as servicing value. Specifically, origination fees and costs, which had been deferred and recognized as part of the gain/loss on sale of the loan, are now recognized in earnings at time of origination. The servicing value, which had been recorded at the time the loan was sold, is now included in the fair value of the loan and recognized at origination. Mortgage servicing income increased $14.0 million, or 45%, primarily due to higher servicing fee income derived from a larger serving portfolio, partially offset by lower gains from servicing asset sales. At June 30, 2007, total loans serviced were $150.5 billion, up $29.0 billion, or 24%, from June 30, 2006. Other noninterest income was up $17.1 million due to higher insurance income and hedge gains associated with loans held at fair value, which were partially offset by corresponding loan losses in production income.
Total noninterest expense was up $44.2 million, or 29%. The second quarter of 2007 expense level included the impact of the Company's election to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value. Under this election, costs associated with the origination of mortgage loans held-for-sale are recognized at the point of origination. Prior to the fair value election, these costs were deferred at origination and recognized as part of the gain/loss in noninterest income at the point of sale to the investor. Also driving the higher expense level was an increase in expense associated with record production volumes and operating losses incurred in the second quarter related to application fraud. The application fraud primarily relates to customer misstatements of income and/or assets on Alt-A products originated in prior periods.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs 2006
Mortgage's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was $49.6 million, a decline of $90.0 million or 64%. The decline was the result of narrower secondary marketing margins, losses associated with prior Alt-A product originations, lower income from sales of servicing assets, and higher volume-related expense. Positively impacting net income was improved fee income from higher production volumes, higher sales volumes, and a larger servicing portfolio.
Net interest income decreased $32.0 million, or 11%, due to lower income on portfolio loans and loans held-for-sale. Net interest income on loans was reduced $17.0 million and net interest income on loans held-for-sale was reduced $19.5 million due to spread compression resulting from higher short-term interest rates. Average loans increased $0.4 billion, or 1%, and average loans held-for-sale increased $2.9 billion, or 35%. The increase in loans held-for-sale was primarily due to the first quarter 2007 transfer of $4.1 billion of portfolio loans to loans held-for-sale. Average deposits increased $0.4 billion, or 27%, due to higher escrow balances associated with higher servicing balances and positively impacted net interest income $11.9 million.
Provision for loan losses increased $18.3 million due to higher Alt-A loan charge-offs. The Company is no longer originating Alt-A products for the held for investment portfolio.
Total noninterest income declined $45.3 million, or 21%, due to lower mortgage production income, slightly offset by higher mortgage servicing income. Mortgage production income declined $71.2 million, or 59%, as the benefits from higher production and sales volumes were more than offset by lower secondary marketing margins and losses on Alt-A loans originated in prior periods. Loan production was $32.8 billion, up $6.2 billion, or 23%, and loan sales to investors were $27.3 billion, up $7.3 billion, or 36%. Servicing
 
income increased $4.7 million, or 6%, due to higher servicing fee income derived from a larger servicing portfolio and slightly lower amortization of servicing rights. This increase was substantially offset by lower gains on sales of servicing assets from the same period in 2006. Other noninterest income was up $21.3 million due to higher insurance income and favorable hedge results on fair value assets which were partially offset by corresponding loan losses in production income.
Total noninterest expense was up $50.7 million, or 17%, due partly to the Company's election to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held-for-sale at fair value, under which certain loan origination costs previously deferred are now recognized at time of origination. Also driving the higher expense level was higher expense associated with stronger production volumes and operating losses related to application fraud. The application fraud primarily relates to customer misstatements of income and/or assets on Alt-A products originated in prior periods.
Wealth and Investment Management
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $53.3 million, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of 2006. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the merger of Lighthouse Partners into Lighthouse Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2007, the sale of the corporate bond trustee business in the third quarter of 2006, and lower net interest income, partially offset by strong growth in retail investment income and lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income decreased $4.2 million, or 5%, due primarily to a shift in deposit mix to higher-cost products as customer preference continues to favor higher-yielding deposit products. Average deposits increased $0.7 billion, or 8%, due to an increase in higher-cost NOW accounts and time deposits, partially offset by declines in lower-cost demand and money market deposits. Average loans decreased slightly as a result of lower consumer mortgages and commercial real estate balances, partially offset by growth in personal credit lines.
Provision for loan losses increased $2.2 million primarily due to higher home equity net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income decreased $2.1 million, or 1%, primarily driven by a decline in trust revenue from the Lighthouse Partners merger and the sale of the corporate bond trustee business. Retail investment income increased $13.6 million, or 24%, due to higher recurring and transactional revenue, with annuity sales exhibiting particular strength.
Total noninterest expense decreased $1.4 million, or 1%, primarily driven by decreased expenses resulting from the Lighthouse Partners merger and a reduction in shared corporate costs, partially offset by increased intangible amortization and staff expenses.
End of period assets under management were approximately $139.1 billion compared to $135.0 billion as of the same period last year. Approximately $5.4 billion of Lighthouse Partners assets were merged into Lighthouse Investment Partners and were not included in the June 30, 2007, total. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the STI Classic Funds, institutional assets managed by Trusco Capital Management, and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $249.9 billion, which includes $139.1 billion in assets under management, $60.3 billion in non-managed trust assets, $42.5 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $7.9 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets. Approximately $21.2 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets were sold at the time of the corporate bond trustee transaction.
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was $120.7 million, an increase of $16.3 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2006. The growth was driven primarily by a gain on sale upon the merger of Lighthouse Partners into Lighthouse Investment Partners and increased retail investment income, partially offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest expenses.
Net interest income decreased $5.1 million, or 3%, as the continued shift in deposit mix to higher-cost products compressed deposit spreads, decreasing net interest income $5.3 million. Average deposits increased $0.7 billion, or 7%, due to increases in higher-cost NOW account products and time deposit balances, partially offset by decreases in lower-cost demand and money market deposits. Average loans increased slightly with most growth coming in consumer loans, partially offset by a decline in consumer mortgages.
Provision for loan losses increased $3.1 million primarily due to higher home equity net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $44.1 million, or 9%, primarily driven by a $32.3 million gain on sale upon merger of Lighthouse Partners. Additionally, retail investment income increased due to higher recurring and transactional revenue, mainly annuity sales. Trust income decreased due to the merger of Lighthouse Partners and the sale of the corporate bond trustee business.
Total noninterest expense increased $11.4 million, or 2%. Growth was primarily attributable to increases in staff and intangible amortization expenses, partially offset by a decrease in shared corporate expenses.
Corporate Other and Treasury
Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $260.3 million, an increase of $189.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2006 and was mainly driven by the $145.6 million after-tax gain on sale of Coke stock and an increase in net interest income due to balance sheet management strategies executed in the first half of this year.
The balance sheet management strategies resulted in improved yields on earning assets, as well as de-levering the balance sheet and reducing the level of higher-cost wholesale funding. This was mainly responsible for the $74.3 million increase in net interest income. Total average assets decreased $7.8 billion, or 23.0%, mainly due to a reduction in the size of the investment portfolio designed to reduce the Company's reliance on wholesale funding sources and increase the capacity to fund future loan growth. Total average deposits decreased $3.3 billion, or 12.2%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits that resulted from the wholesale funding reduction.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $6.1 million.
Total noninterest income increased $199.5 million driven by the $234.8 million pre-tax gain on sale of Coke stock, partially offset by a $21.4 million decrease in trading income due to negative market value adjustments on certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
Total noninterest expense decreased $21.0 million compared to the second quarter of 2006 demonstrating the impact the E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program had on controlling expense growth. This decline was mainly due to a reduction in total staff expenses in support functions, as well as reduced advertising and consulting expenses.
 
Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 vs. 2006
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2006, was $404.1 million, an increase of $257.5 million compared to the same period in 2006 and was mainly driven by the $145.6 million after-tax gain on sale of Coke stock and an increase in net interest income due to the aforementioned balance sheet management strategies executed in the first half of this year.
Net interest income increased $104.5 million due to the balance sheet management strategies. Total average assets decreased $5.0 billion, or 14.8%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio related to the strategies. Total average deposits decreased $0.7 billion, or 2.8%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits also related to the strategies.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, decreased $23.2 million.
Total noninterest income increased $272.0 million driven by the $234.8 million pre-tax gain on sale of Coke stock and a $53.0 million increase in trading profits driven by net positive market value adjustments on certain assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
Total noninterest expense decreased $14.7 million, demonstrating the impact the E

Efficiency and Productivity Program had on controlling expense growth. This decline was mainly due to a reduction in total staff expenses in support functions, as well as reduced advertising and consulting expenses.
