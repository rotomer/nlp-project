Incorporated so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
 
(h) The Guarantor shall have complied with the provisions of the first sentence of Section 5(A)(d) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement.
(i) On or after the Applicable Time, the Trust Preferred Securities shall have been accorded a rating of not less than "A-" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service, not less than "A1" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and not less than "A" by Fitch Ratings.
(j) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Guarantor's debt securities or preferred stock.
(k) On or after the Applicable Time there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Guarantor's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York or Georgia authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
(l) The Trust Preferred Securities being delivered at the applicable Time of Delivery shall have been duly listed, subject to notice of issuance, on the NYSE, or application thereto for such listing shall have been made.
(m) The Company and the Trust shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to you at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company and trustees of the Trust satisfactory to you as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Trust herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company and the Trust of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (g) of this Section and as to such other matters as you may reasonably request.
 
7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Guarantor and the Trust will, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that neither the Guarantor nor the Trust shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Guarantor and the Trust against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Guarantor or the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
 
Guarantor or the Trust by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Guarantor or the Trust for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Guarantor or the Trust, as appropriate, in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Trust Preferred Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above,
 
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Guarantor or the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Guarantor or the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Guarantor and the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Trust Preferred Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Guarantor under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Guarantor or the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
 
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Guarantor and the Trust and to each person, if any, who controls the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act.
8. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Trust Preferred Securities on either the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date which it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on the terms contained herein at such Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as applicable. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, then the Guarantor shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Trust Preferred Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Guarantor that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, or the Guarantor notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Trust Preferred Securities, you or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone such Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Guarantor agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Trust Preferred Securities.
Underwriter Default
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Trust Preferred Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities to be purchased on such Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as applicable, then the Guarantor shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder at such Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Trust Preferred Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Guarantor as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Trust Preferred Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate
 
principal amount of all the Trust Preferred Securities to be purchased at such Closing Date or such Option Closing Date, as the case may be, the Guarantor shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Trust Preferred Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or with respect to the Option Closing Date, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Trust Preferred Securities, and provided that if such default occurs only with respect to the Optional Trust Preferred Securities, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Trust Preferred Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Guarantor, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 7; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
9. . If for any reason the Trust Preferred Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Guarantor as provided herein other than because of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Trust Preferred Securities but the Guarantor shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 5A(j) and 7. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8 hereof, the Guarantor and the Trust shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities with respect to which this Agreement or the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Trust Preferred Securities, as the case may be, shall have been terminated, except as provided in Sections 5A(j) and 7 hereof.
Expenses on Termination
10. . Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
Time of the Essence
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Guarantor or its officers, of the Trust and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Guarantor or the Trust or any of the controlling persons referred to in Section 7(e) hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Trust Preferred Securities. The provisions of Sections 5(A)(j) and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
12. . The Trust and the Guarantor acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Trust Preferred Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Trust and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting
Arm's-Length Terms
 
solely as a principal and not the agent, fiduciary or advisor of the Trust or the Guarantor (and each of the Trust and the Guarantor agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters owe, or any of them owes, a fiduciary or similar duty to the Guarantor or the Trust in connection therewith), and (iii) the Trust and the Guarantor have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
13. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
14. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs, executors, and administrators, and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.
Successors
15. . This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Applicable Law
16. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
17. . This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts; Notices
All notices hereunder shall be in writing or by telegram if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as set forth in Schedule II hereto; and if to the Guarantor or the Trust shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to its address set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Guarantor by the Underwriters upon request.

however
18. . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Guarantor and the Trust are authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Guarantor and the Trust relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind.

Disclosure of Tax Treatment
 
shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
19. . Any action under this Agreement taken by the Underwriters jointly will be binding upon all the Underwriters.

ANNEX II
Pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i) They are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB");
(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) audited or examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the Underwriters;
(iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the Underwriters; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
(iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and/or included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in
 
the audited consolidated financial statements for such five fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
(v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302, 402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;
(vi) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A) (i) the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, or (ii) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Report(s) on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;

303 Peachtree Street, NE
Atlanta, GA 30308
Ladies and Gentlemen:
