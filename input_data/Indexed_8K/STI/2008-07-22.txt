The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and Item 7.01, "Regulation FD Disclosure." Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On July 22, 2008, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Registrant") announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. A copy of the news release announcing the Registrant's results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Registrant intends to hold an investor call and webcast to discuss financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 on July 22, 2008, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time. Additional presentation materials relating to such call are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
All information in the news release and the presentation materials speak as of the date thereof and the Registrant does not assume any obligation to update such information in the future. In addition, the Registrant disclaims any inference regarding the materiality of such information which otherwise may arise as a result of its furnishing such information under Item 2.02 and/or Item 7.01 of this report on Form 8-K.
 
SunTrust Banks, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, "SunTrust") have completed or entered into transactions involving all of its approximately 43.6 million shares of the common stock of The Coca-Cola Company ("Coke Shares"). In the aggregate, these transactions resulted in an increase in Tier 1 Capital of approximately $1.14 billion, or an estimated 68 basis points. Approximately $345 million of this amount, or an estimated 20 basis points, was recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and approximately $797 million of such amount, or an estimated 48 basis points, relates to transactions executed in July and will be reflected in the third quarter results. These transactions also resulted in an aggregate increase to net income (after tax) of approximately $414 million. Approximately $345 million of such increase in net income was recognized in the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and $69 million of such increase in net income was realized in July and will be reflected in the third quarter results.
There were three sets of transactions: (1) equity forward agreements covering 30 million Coke Shares, (2) open market sales covering 10 million Coke Shares, and (3) a charitable gift to the SunTrust Foundation of approximately 3.6 million Coke Shares, all described in greater detail below. These transactions are the culmination of a capital review initiative that commenced in early 2007. SunTrust's primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits it obtains from its long-term holding of this asset, including capital treatment by bank regulators, and does not reflect any opinion of The Coca-Cola Company.
Equity Forward Agreements
SunTrust entered into variable forward purchase agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution ("Counterparty") collectively covering 30 million Coke Shares (the "Agreements"). Under the Agreements, SunTrust must deliver to Counterparty at settlement either a variable number of Coke Shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. Counterparty is obligated to settle the Agreements for no less than approximately $39 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the "Minimum Proceeds"). The share forward agreements with Counterparty give SunTrust the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke Shares which it does not deliver to Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward purchase agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that SunTrust will be able to sell its 30 million Coke Shares at a price no less than approximately $39 per share, while permitting SunTrust to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke Shares up to approximately $66 per Coke Share.
SunTrust expects settlement to occur in approximately 7 years. However, SunTrust also has the option to terminate the Agreements earlier with the approval of the Federal Reserve. The Agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default, extraordinary events regarding The Coca-Cola Company, and other typical termination events. Upon early termination, there could be exit costs or gains, such as certain breakage fees, including an interest-rate make-whole amount. Such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that would need to be determined. However, the payment of such costs, if any, will not result in SunTrust receiving less than the Minimum Proceeds.
SunTrust has received an opinion from its external legal counsel to the effect that entering into the Agreements should not result in a taxable disposition of the Coke Shares covered by such Agreements. Accordingly, SunTrust should not recognize taxable gain on such shares until it actually sells the Coke Shares under the Agreements or in another transaction. SunTrust's present intention is to retain the 30 million Coke Shares for approximately 7 years and to sell the 30 million Coke Shares under the Agreements or in another market transaction at that time. SunTrust's financial statements continue to reflect a deferred tax liability for an estimate of taxes that would be paid on the future sale of the 30 million Coke Shares.
Counterparty has invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Banks, Inc. (collectively, the "Notes") in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds. The Notes mature in approximately 10 years and bear interest at 1-month Libor plus a fixed spread. However, upon the early termination of the Agreements, should that occur, the scheduled maturity of these Notes may accelerate to 3 years following settlement of the Agreements. Counterparty has pledged the Notes to SunTrust, and SunTrust has pledged the 30 million Coke Shares to Counterparty, each to secure its respective obligations under the Agreements. The pledged Coke Shares are held by an independent third-party custodian, and Counterparty is prohibited under the Agreements from selling, pledging, assigning or otherwise using the pledged Coke Shares in its business.
SunTrust generally may not prepay the Notes. The interest rate of the Notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of the Agreements, either through a remarketing process or based upon dealer quotations. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the Notes, SunTrust would be required to collateralize the Notes and the maturity of the Notes may accelerate to the one year anniversary of the settlement of the Agreements. However, SunTrust presently believes that it is substantially certain that the Notes will be successfully remarketed.
The Federal Reserve has determined that SunTrust may immediately include in Tier 1 Capital an amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds minus the deferred tax liability associated with the ultimate sale of the 30 million Coke Shares. Accordingly, the Agreements have resulted in an increase in Tier 1 Capital during the third quarter of approximately $728 million or an estimated 44 basis points. For accounting purposes, SunTrust will not recognize a gain until SunTrust actually sells the Coke Shares.
During the terms of the Agreements, and until SunTrust sells the 30 million Coke Shares, SunTrust generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by The Coca-Cola Company and will have the right to vote such shares of stock. However, the amounts payable to SunTrust under the Agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends received are not equivalent to expected amounts.
Open Market Transactions
Separately, SunTrust sold 10 million Coke Shares in open market transactions during the second quarter of 2008. These sales increased Tier 1 Capital in the second quarter by $345 million, or approximately 20 basis points, and resulted in a realized accounting gain of $345 million, net of taxes.
Charitable Gift to the SunTrust Foundation
SunTrust contributed approximately 3.6 million unrestricted Coke Shares to the SunTrust Foundation in July, 2008. SunTrust expects this gift to act as an endowment for the SunTrust Foundation to make grants to charities operating within the SunTrust footprint for years to come. SunTrust expects to receive a
charitable deduction for income tax purposes in the third quarter of 2008 for the fair market value of the donated Coke Shares. The contribution has resulted in an increase in Tier 1 Capital during the third quarter of approximately $69 million, or an estimated 4 basis points.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
July 22, 2008
 
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders of $535.3 million for the second quarter of 2008, or $1.53 per average common diluted share, compared to $673.9 million, or $1.89 per average common diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. The results for the second quarter of 2008 included a number of gains and losses that were unrelated to the Company's core performance, the largest of which was the sale of 10 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company ("Coke") common stock. The aggregate net earnings impact of these items was an increase of $0.75 per average diluted common share. The second quarter of 2007 results included a gain on the sale of 4.5 million shares of Coke common stock, the net impact of which was $0.41 per average common diluted share.
The Company recently completed three separate transactions to optimize its long-term holdings of Coke common stock. Collectively, these transactions are estimated to have increased Tier 1 capital by 68 basis points. Further, one of the transactions involved a charitable contribution that will allow the legacy of The Coca-Cola Company and SunTrust relationship to benefit communities for years to come.
"Our capital position solidified during the quarter as a result of the Coke stock-related transactions which make SunTrust even better prepared to address the challenges of the current environment, as well as strengthen our position for the long-term," said James M. Wells III, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Against a backdrop of economic weakness, deteriorating market conditions, and industry-wide volatility, our second quarter results reflect the Company's intense focus on managing our core business, balance sheet, and credit risk through this difficult cycle."
During the quarter, the Company grew loans and deposits, expanded net interest margin, and improved certain fee income categories. Further, tightly managed growth of core operating expenses reflected the continuing success of SunTrust's ongoing program to improve efficiency and productivity, although expenses continue to be pressured by credit-related costs. Additionally, the Company successfully reduced its risk profile during the second quarter by shedding an additional 50% of its higher-risk trading securities acquired from certain affiliated companies during the fourth quarter of 2007, bringing its exposure to these securities to less than $800 million.
Mr. Wells noted that the high costs of credit continued to take a toll on earnings, though at a slower pace than the prior quarter. Given the strengthened capital position, core earnings performance, and recent credit trends, Mr. Wells reiterated that the Company does not have any current plans to modify the dividend or issue additional shares of common stock.
Coke Common Stock Transactions
During the second and third quarters of 2008, the Company completed three transactions to optimize the regulatory capital contribution of its long-term holdings of Coke common stock:
 
 
As a result of the Coke stock transactions completed in July, the Company's estimated Tier 1 capital position of 7.47% as of June 30, 2008 would have increased to an estimated 7.95% at June 30, 2008 on a proforma basis.
"It is timely to reiterate that the impetus for the transactions announced today was exclusively related to SunTrust's own capital optimization goals," noted Mr. Wells. "We retain the highest degree of institutional respect for The CocaCola Company as one of the world's leading companies with whom SunTrust has enjoyed a long, positive, and productive relationship. We are particularly pleased that one legacy of our Coke stock holdings is support for our future charitable giving and community commitment."
Credit
The Company's net charge-offs and certain other key credit metrics continued to deteriorate in the second quarter, though at a slower place than the prior quarter. Overall, credit metrics remain elevated, principally as a result of loans secured by real estate. Net charge-offs increased 8.6% from the first quarter, which equated to an annualized 104 basis points of average loans. Provision expense declined from the first quarter of 2008, as the slowing pace of credit deterioration necessitated a smaller increase in the reserve. Total provision expense was $448.0 million, as compared to $560.0 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $104.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. The allowance for loan losses increased to $1,829.4 million, or 1.46% of total loans outstanding, which is up 41 basis points from the end of 2007 and 21 basis points from the first quarter of 2008.
Second Quarter 2008 Consolidated Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,598.0 million for the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 9.4% compared to the second quarter of 2007, driven by the incremental net securities gains primarily related to gains on the sale of the Coke stock and fee income. These growth items were partially offset by a 2.9% decline in net interest income and valuation losses related to our publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value. Excluding net securities gains, total revenue decreased 4.2%.
For the six months, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $4,823.3 million, up 8.6% over prior year. The increase was driven by incremental net securities gains of $252.8 million, gains on the sale of non- strategic businesses and the sale/leaseback of certain corporate real estate properties, the Visa IPO gain, and fee income, partially offset by lower net interest income and net mark to market valuation losses on trading assets and publicly-traded debt recorded at fair value.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,185.0 million in the second quarter of 2008, a decrease of 2.9% from the second quarter of 2007, despite a three basis point improvement in net interest margin. Earning assets declined $5.1 billion, or 3.2%, primarily due to a reduction in interest earning trading assets and loans held for sale, partially offset by growth in commercial loans. The increase in net interest margin and the decrease in trading assets were the result of balance sheet management strategies initiated in 2007. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest margin increased six basis points, as the decline in funding costs exceeded the decline in asset yields.
For the six months, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2,352.8 million, a decline of 2.3% from 2007. However, net interest margin improved four basis points as balance sheet management strategies executed in 2007 led to a $5.8 billion decline in average earning assets, namely loans held for sale and interest bearing trading assets, which was partially offset by growth in commercial loans.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1,413.0 million for the second quarter of 2008, up $258.4 million, or 22.4%, from the second quarter of 2007. The second quarter of 2008 included the gain on the sale of Coke stock of $548.8 million and a $29.6 million gain on the sale of First Mercantile Trust, a retirement plan services subsidiary, as compared to the second quarter of 2007, which included a gain on the sale of Coke stock of $234.8 million and a $23.4 million gain generated from a private equity transaction.
During the quarter, the Company recorded approximately $102.6 million in market valuation losses in trading account profits and commissions related primarily to the Company's publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value. These losses were related to the improvement in the credit spread on the Company's public debt. Also, contributing to the decline in trading accounts profits and commissions were costs associated with derivative contracts executed in connection with the Coke transaction. Partially offsetting these valuation related losses was an improvement in fixed income trading revenue relative to prior year. The second quarter of 2007 also included market value adjustments on financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value.
Mortgage production income was $63.5 million in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to $64.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. Lower loan production and related fees were offset by higher fee recognition due to the elimination of the FAS 91 income deferral upon adoption of FAS 159 during the second quarter of 2007. In addition, the Company recognized valuation losses in the second quarter of 2007 on the Alt-A loans held in the warehouse. Mortgage servicing related income in the second quarter of 2008 declined $13.0 million primarily due to an $11.7 million gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights during the second quarter of 2007.
 
In the second quarter of 2008, the Company experienced strong growth in service charges on deposit accounts and card fees, which increased 17.0% and 14.6%, respectively, over the same period of 2007. Other income declined $53.4 million year over year primarily due to gains on private equity transactions and structured leasing transactions in 2007.
For the six months, total noninterest income was $2,470.5 million, $437.0 million or 21.5% over the $2,033.5 million earned for the same period of 2007. The increase was largely due to the following transaction-related gains:
 
 
 
 
 
Partially offsetting these gains were securities losses recorded in the first quarter of 2008 of $64.1 million in conjunction with available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired, as well as a decline in trading account profits and commissions primarily related to valuation losses on trading assets that were acquired in late 2007, net of valuation gains on publicly-traded debt and related hedges. In 2007, $81.0 million of trading gains were recognized related to financial assets and liabilities that the Company elected to record at fair value in connection with the adoption of FAS 159. Mortgage production income increased 167.8% over the first six months of 2007 due to the earlier recognition of servicing rights and origination fees in accordance with recently adopted accounting standards partially offset by a decline in loan production. The prior period also included $42.2 million of income reductions recorded in conjunction with our election to record certain loans held for sale at fair value. Consistent with the quarterly comparison, revenue from card fees and service charges on deposit accounts experienced double digit growth over the same period of 2007, while trust and investment management income declined primarily due to the disposition of our interests in Lighthouse Investment Partners.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2008 was $1,378.5 million, up $127.3 million, or 10.2%, from the second quarter of 2007, as credit related expenses grew by $69.5 million and an impairment charge of $45.0 million related to a customer intangible asset was recorded in the second quarter of 2008. Core expenses were well controlled as a result of the Company's E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program, which generated gross savings of approximately $135 million for the quarter. The impairment charge pertains to client relationships that were valued in 2004 in connection with an acquisition. While the overall business has performed satisfactorily, the attrition level of the legacy clients has recently increased resulting in the acceleration of the amortization of this intangible asset. Personnel expenses in the second quarter of 2008 increased $1.3 million, or 0.2%, from the same period in 2007; however, personnel expenses would have declined taking into account the impact related to loan origination costs that were deferred prior to the Company's election during the second quarter of 2007 to record at fair value certain newly-originated mortgage loans held for sale. Total personnel declined from 33,241 as of June 30, 2007 to 31,602 as of June 30, 2008. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, personnel expense declined $3.1 million due a reduction in seasonal employee benefits expenses. The decrease was offset by a $3.8 million increase in expenses from the acquisition of GB&T. Other expenses increased in the second quarter of 2008, including a $69.5 million increase in credit-related expenses such as collection services, valuation losses on other real estate owned, mortgage insurance reserves, and mortgage fraud related losses. Of particular mention is the $25.0 million increase in the mortgage insurance reserve which pertains to our mortgage insurance guaranty subsidiary, Twin Rivers. Twin Rivers' loss exposure arises from third-party mortgage insurers transferring a portion of their first loss exposure when losses by mortgage origination year exceed certain thresholds. We estimate losses in Twin Rivers to be in the range of $25 million to $50 million for each of the remaining two quarters of 2008, and our estimated maximum exposure, net of premium income, to be less than $200 million with the timing and ultimate amount of loss recognition being uncertain.
 
For the six months, total noninterest expense was $2,633.7 million, an increase of $146.5 million, or 5.9%, over the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the same reasons related to the quarterly increase. In addition, in 2008 the Company recorded a $39.1 million reduction in the Visa litigation accrued liability following the Visa IPO. The Company's E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program generated year-to-date gross savings of approximately $248 million.
Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2008, SunTrust had total assets of $177.4 billion. Shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion as of June 30, 2008 represented 10.1% of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were $49.24 and $29.99 as of June 30, 2008, respectively.
Loans
Average loans for the second quarter of 2008 were $125.2 billion, up $7.0 billion, or 5.9%, from the second quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily in commercial-related categories. Construction loans declined $2.2 billion due to the Company's risk mitigation efforts and indirect auto loans declined $626 million driven by SunTrust's de-emphasis of this product channel. Average loans held for sale declined $8.3 billion, or 61.7%, as loan originations declined 48%, production shifted to predominantly agency products, and efficiency improved in loan delivery. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, average loans were up $1.9 billion, or 6.3% on a sequential annualized basis, driven by commercial loan growth and the acquisition of GB&T.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter of 2008 were $101.7 billion, up $3.8 billion, or 3.9%, from the second quarter of 2007, as increases in NOW and money market deposits were partially offset by declines in demand deposit and savings account balances. Average total brokered and foreign deposits declined 37.2% from the second quarter of 2007, as the Company deliberately reduced the size of its earning assets, thereby enabling the reduction of higher cost funding sources and substantially improving the Company's liquidity position. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, average consumer and commercial deposits increased $558.5 million, or 2.2% on a sequential annualized basis, with most of the growth in lower cost deposit products unrelated to the GB&T acquisition.
Capital
The estimated Tier 1 capital, total average shareholders' equity to total average assets, and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios at June 30, 2008, were 7.47%, 10.31%, and 6.23%, respectively. Tier 1 capital decreased two basis points compared to June 30, 2007, while the total average shareholders' equity to total average assets and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios increased 35 and 38 basis points, respectively. The sale of 10 million shares of Coke common stock increased Tier 1 capital by 20 basis points. The contribution of 3.6 million shares to the SunTrust Foundation and the incremental Tier 1 capital transaction which were both completed in July 2008 would have increased Tier 1 capital by approximately 48 basis points had they been completed in the second quarter, resulting in an estimated proforma Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.95% at June 30, 2008. These transactions are also expected to increase the total capital ratio from an estimated 10.86% to 10.97%. The Company's regulatory capital ratios are significantly in excess of the regulatory requirements for well capitalized status.
Asset Quality
Annualized net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2008 were 1.04% of average loans, up from 0.30% in the second quarter of 2007 and 0.97% in the first quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs were $323
 
million in the second quarter of 2008, as compared to $88 million in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in net charge-offs over the second quarter of 2007 reflects deterioration in consumer credit, particularly in residential real estate secured loans. The increase in net charge-offs in 2008 was most pronounced in home equity and residential mortgages.
Nonperforming loans were $2,789 million, or 2.22%, of total loans as of June 30, 2008, compared to $2,069 million, or 1.67%, of total loans as of March 31, 2008, and $765 million, or 0.64%, of total loans, as of June 30, 2007. The increase in nonperforming loans was mainly due to an increase in residential mortgage and real estate construction loans as the overall weakening of the housing markets and economy continued to increase delinquencies.
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $1,829 million as of June 30, 2008. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was attributable to the deterioration in certain segments of the consumer and residential real estate market. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2008 represented 1.46% of period-end total loans as compared to 1.05 % as of December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of June 30, 2008 represented 72% of period-end nonperforming loans, the majority of which were mortgages secured by residential real estate. Provision in excess of net charge-offs was $125 million, adding approximately ten basis points to the allowance, while the consolidation of GB&T accounted for the remaining increase.
The Company continued to record provision for loan losses at elevated levels in the second quarter of 2008, although it was down from the first quarter of 2008, as charge-offs increased less than expected and slowing deterioration in the portfolio necessitated a lower level of reserve building.
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The following discussion details results for SunTrust's four business lines: Retail and Commercial Banking, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage, and Wealth and Investment Management. In 2007, the Company had five business segments. The segment reporting structure was adjusted to align with the recently modified organizational structure that better aligns with serving clients' needs.
All revenue is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the lines of business, results include net interest income which is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing. Further, provision for loan losses is represented by net charge-offs.
SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other and Treasury, which includes the Treasury department as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. This segment also includes differences created between internal management accounting practices and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges, differences in loan loss provision compared to net charge-offs, as well as equity and its related impact. GB&T customer loans, customer deposits, the majority of the employees, among other items, have been integrated within the business lines; however, the associated goodwill has not been distributed and remains in Corporate Other and Treasury.
Retail and Commercial Banking
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $110.7 million, a decrease of $88.9 million, or 44.5%, compared to the second quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision expense due to home equity line net charge-offs and lower net interest income related to deposit spreads, partially offset by higher noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased $65.5 million, or 9.1%, driven by a shift in the mix of deposits and the decline in interest rates, which compressed spreads on deposits. Average deposit balances were relatively unchanged while deposit spreads decreased 32 basis points, driving $63.8 million of the decrease in net interest income. Average loan balances declined $70.3 million, or 0.1%, with the movement of the Middle Market clients to the Wholesale Banking segment decreasing loans by $2.2 billion. The remaining loan
 
growth was driven by loans acquired in the GB&T acquisition, commercial loans, equity lines, and student loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $125.9 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity, indirect auto and commercial loans (primarily commercial clients with annual revenues of less then $5 million), reflecting the negative impact from the current deterioration in certain segments of the consumer portfolio, primarily related to the residential real estate market.
Total noninterest income increased $43.8 million, or 14.5%, from the second quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $28.2 million, or 16.2%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts from both consumer and business accounts, primarily due to growth in number of accounts, higher NSF rates and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $7.9 million, or 15.5%, and ATM revenue increased $3.5 million, or 11.7%.
Total noninterest expense decreased $6.3 million, or 1.0%, from the first quarter of 2007. The continuing positive impact of expense savings initiatives was partially offset by higher credit related expenses and continued investments in the branch distribution network.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $204.2 million, a decrease of $197.1 million, or 49.1%, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision expense due to home equity line net charge-offs and lower net interest income related to deposit spreads, partially offset by higher noninterest income.
Net interest income decreased $149.6 million, or 10.5%, driven by a continued shift in deposit mix and decreased spreads as deposit competition and the interest rate environment encouraged customers to migrate into higher yielding interest bearing deposits. Average deposit balances were relatively unchanged while deposit spreads decreased 38 basis points driving $151.8 million of the decrease in net interest income. Average loan balances declined $333.2 million, or 0.7%, with the movement of the Middle Market clients to the Wholesale Banking segment decreasing loans by $2.1 billion. That decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans, equity lines, and student loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $258.0 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity, indirect, and commercial loans (primarily commercial clients with annual revenues of less then $5 million), reflecting the negative impact from the current deterioration in certain segments of the consumer portfolio, primarily related to the residential real estate market.
Total noninterest income increased $71.4 million, or 12.0%, over the same period in 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $47.1 million, or 13.8%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts from both consumer and business accounts primarily due to growth in number of accounts, higher NSF rates, and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $14.8 million, or 15.2%, and ATM revenue increased $4.1 million, or 6.9%.
Total noninterest expense decreased $22.1 million, or 1.7%, from the same period in 2007. The continuing positive impact of expense savings initiatives was partially offset by higher credit-related expenses and continued investments in the branch distribution network.
Wholesale Banking
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $74.8 million, a decrease of $43.9 million, or 37.0%, compared to the prior year. Reductions in private equity gains and declining balances in the residential construction portfolio were the primary drivers of the decline.
Net interest income decreased $15.1 million, or 10.3%. While average loan balances increased $4.9 billion, or 17.1%, the corresponding net interest income declined $11.6 million, or 10.0%. The increase in
 
loan balances includes an approximate $2.2 billion impact from the migration of Middle Market clients from the Commercial line of business to Wholesale Banking. Loan balances increased approximately $2.7 billion, or 9.5%, in the remainder of Wholesale Banking driven by growth in corporate banking partially offset by declines in the residential builder portfolio. The decline in loan-related net interest income is due to a shift in mix away from higher spread construction loans to lower spread commercial loans and increased real estate related nonaccrual loans. Total average deposits were up $4.4 billion, or 93.3%, primarily in higher cost corporate money market accounts. The associated net interest income decreased $3.6 million driven by the decline in interest rates, which compressed spreads on deposits, and by lower demand deposits partially offset by the increase in higher cost corporate money market balances.
Provision for loan losses was $11.0 million, a decrease of $4.6 million from the same period in 2007. The decline resulted from lower charge-offs in corporate banking, partially offset by higher residential builder-related charge-offs.
Total noninterest income decreased $40.9 million, or 18.1%. Solid performances in fixed income sales and trading, derivatives, tax-exempt, and equity capital markets were masked by a reduction in private equity gains, the largest of which was $23.4 million, as well as lower revenues from loan syndications, bond originations, structured leasing, and asset securitization activity.
Total noninterest expense increased $4.9 million, or 2.5%. The increase was primarily driven by Middle Market which accounted for $6.7 million of the increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking expenses decreased $1.7 million, or 0.9%, driven primarily by lower incentive-based compensation, personnel, and discretionary expenses partially offset by higher Affordable Housing related expenses and higher operating losses, other real estate and credit services expenses.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $161.9 million, a decrease of $49.5 million, or 23.4%, compared to the same period in 2007. Reductions in private equity gains and declining balances in the residential construction portfolio were the primary drivers of the decline.
Net interest income decreased $19.3 million, or 6.6%. Average loan balances increased $4.0 billion, or 13.8%. Despite the growth, the corresponding net interest income declined $10.7 million, or 4.6%. The increase in loan balances includes an approximate $2.1 billion impact from the migration of Middle Market clients from the Commercial line of business to Wholesale Banking. Loan balances increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 6.7%, in the remainder of Wholesale Banking despite a $1.9 billion structured asset sale of corporate loans at the end of the first quarter 2007. The loan growth was driven by corporate banking partially offset by declines in the residential builder portfolio. The decline in net interest income is due to a shift in mix away from higher spread construction loans to lower spread commercial loans and increased real estate related nonaccrual loans. Total average deposits were up $4.1 billion, or 86.2%, primarily in higher cost corporate money market accounts. The associated net interest income decreased $6.2 million driven by the lower credit for funds on demand deposits partially offset by the increase in higher cost corporate money market balances.
Provision for loan losses was $23.3 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the same period in 2007, resulting from higher residential builder related charge-offs partially offset by lower charge-offs in corporate banking.
Total noninterest income decreased $36.0 million, or 9.1%. Solid performances in fixed income sales and trading, derivatives, bonds and equity capital markets were masked by a reduction in private equity gains, as well as lower revenues from loan syndications, M&A activity, and a decrease in asset securitization related transactions.
Total noninterest expense increased $14.4 million, or 3.7%. The transfer of Middle Market accounted for $13.0 million of the increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking's expense increased $1.4 million or 0.4%, driven primarily by higher Affordable Housing related expenses and outside processing expenses, partially offset by lower discretionary, personnel and shared corporate expenses.
 
Mortgage
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage reported a net loss of $91.1 million for the second quarter of 2008, a decrease of $132.6 million compared with the second quarter of 2007. The decline was principally due to credit-related costs and lower servicing income.
Net interest income decreased $10.7 million, or 8.0%. Average loans increased $2.3 billion, or 7.7%; however, the resulting net interest income declined $12.9 million principally due to increased residential real estate nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.1 billion resulting in a decrease of $10.8 million in net interest income. Also contributing to the net interest income decline was a lower funds credit for other liabilities of $6.1 million and a higher funds charge for other assets of $4.8 million. Partially offsetting the declines was an $11.5 million increase in net interest income from mortgage-backed securities and higher income from loans held for sale of $5.2 million. Loans held for sale balances declined $8.3 billion but income was up due to wider spreads.
Provision for loan losses increased $115.0 million due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income decreased $28.3 million, or 20.7% primarily driven by lower servicing income. Servicing income was down $32.7 million due to MSR asset hedge costs, higher MSR amortization, and lower gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights offset by higher fee income due to a larger servicing portfolio. Total loans serviced at June 30, 2008 were $158.8 billion compared with $150.5 billion at June 30, 2007. Loan production of $9.3 billion was down $8.6 billion, or 48.0%, from second quarter 2007. Production income, which was up $4.9 million compared to the second quarter of 2007, was affected by the election in second quarter 2007 to record certain newly-originated mortgage loans held for sale at fair value under the provisions of FAS 159. The election affected the timing of recognition of origination fees and costs, as well as servicing value. Loan fees recorded in production income were $31.2 million higher in second quarter 2008 due to the recognition of fees that were deferred prior to the election, but were partially offset by reduced income due to lower production.
Total noninterest expense increased $59.6 million, or 30.2%. Higher origination expense of $31.6 million due to the May 2007 election of FAS 159 was partially offset by lower incentive expense of $28.5 million due to reduced loan production. Reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $25.0 million and other real estate expense increased $17.0 million principally due to additional write-downs for declining property values. Additionally, operating losses increased $11.5 million, primarily driven by borrower misrepresentation.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage reported a net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2008 of $122.4 million, a decrease of $170.8 million compared to the same period in 2007. Increases in credit-related costs and lower servicing income drove the decrease in net income.
Net interest income decreased $9.7 million, or 3.7%, from the comparable period in 2007. Total loans increased $0.9 billion, or 3.1%; however, income declined $28.3 million principally due to increased residential real estate nonaccrual loans and lower income from residential construction loans. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.0 billion resulting in a $20.4 million decrease in net interest income. Also contributing to the net interest income decline was a lower funds credit for other liabilities of $7.6 million and a higher funds charge for other assets of $11.6 million. Partially offsetting the decline was higher income from mortgage-backed securities of $20.0 million and higher income from loans held for sale of $19.8 million due to wider spreads.
 
Provision for loan losses increased $203.0 million due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $65.4 million, or 37.3%, principally due to higher production income that was partially offset by lower servicing income. Year-to-date loan production of $21.1 billion was down $11.7 billion, or 35.7%, from 2007. Production income was up $109.3 million due to better secondary marketing margins and increased loan fees of $69.5 million that were deferred prior to the election of FAS 159 partially offset by lower income resulting from lower production. Servicing income was down $38.6 million due to higher MSR amortization, MSR asset hedge costs and lower gains from sales of mortgage servicing rights. Higher fee income due to a larger servicing portfolio partially offset the lower income.
Total noninterest expense increased $127.6 million, or 36.5%. Higher origination expense of $66.1 million due to the May 2007 election of FAS 159 was partially offset by lower incentive expense of $36.8 million due to reduced loan production. Reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $32.0 million and other real estate expense increased $26.6 million principally due to additional write-downs for declining property values. Additionally, operating losses increased $30.2 million, primarily driven by borrower misrepresentation.
Wealth and Investment Management
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $43.7 million, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 18.9%. The decrease was driven by a $27.9 million after-tax impairment charge on client based intangibles due to a reduction in the estimated weighted average remaining life of the client relationships. This adjustment was partially offset by an $18.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of First Mercantile Trust. The remaining net income was relatively flat compared to the second quarter of 2007, as lower noninterest income from the sales of First Mercantile Trust and Lighthouse Partners was offset by lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income decreased $4.1 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to a continued shift in deposit mix to higher cost deposits. Average deposits were practically unchanged, as declines in demand deposit and savings accounts were offset by an increase in higher-cost NOW accounts. This shift in deposit mix, coupled with compressed spreads due to increased competition for deposits resulted in a $3.8 million decrease in net interest income. Average loans increased $174.9 million, or 2.2%. Commercial loans increased $212.0 million, or 8.0%, partially offset by a $67.6 million, or 2.0%, decrease in consumer loans. The change in mix from higher spread consumer loans to lower spreads commercial loans resulted in a slight decline in loan interest income.
Provision for loan losses decreased $0.4 million primarily due to lower commercial net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $18.8 million, or 7.5%, mainly driven by a $29.6 million gain on sale of First Mercantile Trust. This increase was partially offset by a $9.1 million decline in noninterest income associated with the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust. Retail investment income increased $1.0 million, or 1.4%, due to strong annuity sales and higher recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $6.9 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust. As of June 30, 2008, assets under management were approximately $136.7 billion compared to $139.1 billion as of June 30, 2007. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, institutional assets managed by RidgeWorth Capital Management, and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $230.5 billion, which includes $136.7 billion in assets under management, $53.8 billion in non-managed trust assets, $37.9 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $2.1 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.
Total noninterest expense increased $33.6 million, or 13.5%, primarily due to the $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible asset. Noninterest expense before intangible amortization was down $9.6 million, or 3.9%, compared to the second quarter of 2007 driven by lower staff and
 
discretionary expenses, as well as lower structural expense resulting from the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $148.0 million, an increase of $26.1 million, or 21.4%, from the prior year period. The following transactions represented $25.8 million of the year-over-year increase:
 
 
 
 
Net interest income decreased $14.0 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to a continued shift in deposit mix to higher cost deposits. Average deposits were practically unchanged as declines in demand deposits and savings accounts were offset by increases in higher-cost NOW and certificate of deposit balances. This shift in deposit mix coupled with compressed spreads due to increased competition for deposits resulted in an $11.6 million decrease in net interest income. Average loans declined slightly as increases in commercial loans were more than offset by declines in higher spread consumer loans resulting in a $1.4 million decline in net interest income.
Provision for loan losses increased $3.7 million, as declines in commercial lending net charge-offs were more than offset by higher home equity, consumer direct, and consumer mortgage net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $64.5 million, or 12.0%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2007 driven by a $29.6 million gain on the sale of First Mercantile Trust and $35.2 million of incremental revenue from the sale of our Lighthouse Partners investment. Retail investment income increased $8.7 million, or 6.5%, due to strong annuity sales and higher recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $20.6 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to the aforementioned sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust which resulted in a $24.4 million decline in trust income.
Total noninterest expense increased $8.2 million, or 1.6%, due to the $45.0 million impairment charge on the client based intangible. Noninterest expense before intangible amortization declined $36.1 million, or 7.1%, driven by lower staff, discretionary, and indirect expenses, as well as lower structural expense resulting from the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust.
Corporate Other and Treasury
Three Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $402.3 million, an increase of $134.5 million, or 50.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increase was driven by an increase in securities gains primarily related to the gain on sale of Coke stock offset by an increase in provision expense.
Net interest income increased $60.4 million, or 44.9%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to interest rate risk management activities. Total average assets decreased $5.6 billion, or 21.7%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio as part of the Company's overall balance sheet management strategy. Total average deposits decreased $10.1 billion, or 41.4%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
 
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $107.5 million in conjunction with an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to the further deterioration in the residential real estate market and consumer credit quality.
Total noninterest income increased $264.9 million in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Securities gains increased $314.7 million primarily related to increased gains on the sale of Coke stock. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $67.9 million driven by net negative valuations on trading securities and long-term debt, net of hedges, carried at fair value. These net valuation losses are primarily due to the impact of credit spread tightening on the Company's publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value.
Total noninterest expense increased $35.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2007. The increase in expenses was mainly due to increased advertising costs due to the "My Cause" campaign, reduction in real estate gains received in 2007, and an increase in expenses due to the GB&T acquisition.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008 was $439.2 million, an increase of $19.5 million, or 4.6%, from the same period in 2007. The increase was driven by an increase in securities gains including gains on the sale of Coke stock offset by an increase in provision expense.
Net interest income increased $137.3 million, or 55.8%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to interest rate risk management activities Total average assets decreased $7.2 billion, or 25.1%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of trading assets. Total average deposits decreased $10.8 billion, or 42.1%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $377.4 million in conjunction with an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to deterioration in the residential real estate market and consumer credit quality.
Total noninterest income increased $271.7 million, or 82.3%, compared to the same period in 2007. Securities gains increased $259.0 million primarily related to $312 million in increased gains on the sale of Coke stock. In addition, the Company realized an $86.3 million gain on its holdings of Visa in connection with its initial public offering and an additional $37.0 million gain from the sale/leaseback of real estate properties. These gains were partially offset by a $53.3 million increase in securities losses during this period primarily driven by market value impairment related primarily to certain asset-backed securities that were classified as available for sale and estimated to be other-than-temporarily impaired, triggering accounting recognition of the unrealized loss in current period earnings. Noninterest income also included an additional $58.7 million of net negative marks in 2008 versus $50.3 million of net positive marks on trading securities and long-term debt carried at fair value. These mark-downs reflect the lack of liquidity in the market for these securities, deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying assets, and changes in the credit spread on our publicly-traded debt carried at fair value.
Total noninterest expense increased $18.3 million from the same period in 2007. The increase in expense was mainly due to an increase of $16.8 million in advertising costs due to the "My Cause" campaign, $10.7 million reduction in real estate gains, and $10.2 million in increased acquisition expense related to GB&T. These increases were partially offset by a $39.1 million partial reversal of an accrual for Visa litigation.
