Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
For Immediate Release
October 23, 2008
 
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders of $307.3 million for the third quarter of 2008, or $0.88 per average common diluted share, compared to $412.6 million, or $1.18 per average common diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. The challenging credit environment continued to have an adverse impact on the Company's financial performance as evidenced by the increase in net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, and credit-related expenses.
"SunTrust's continued profitability and improved capital position not only underscore our resiliency in a quarter marked by unprecedented industry turmoil, but also serve as a realistic basis for our confidence that we will continue to manage successfullyalbeit not unscathedthrough the challenges that our industry clearly will face in the period ahead," said James M. Wells III, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We also believe that there will be attractive growth opportunities for SunTrust in the near future. With that in mind, we will continue to take the steps necessary for us to be able to capitalize on those opportunities."
Mr. Wells said the potential impact of economic weakness on credit quality remains "near-term concern number one" for SunTrust even though the Company has been seeing some "signs of slowing credit deterioration." Mr. Wells said charge-offs, which were in line with expectations in the third quarter, are likely to remain at elevated levels into 2009.
"We are managing our credit risk profile very carefully to minimize the impact of further deterioration in the economy," said Mr. Wells. "However, we have all seen how quickly things can change in this environment. As a result, we do not believe it prudent or responsible to try to predict the ultimate path of the economy and the resulting impact on asset quality and earnings." Mr. Wells noted that the Company's Board of Directors has authorized an application for the sale of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP program, and also that the Company continues to evaluate its capital structure and dividend policy. Mr. Wells said he expects the evaluation to be completed "in short order" with any decisions communicated promptly.
Mr. Wells pointed out that despite the current industry turmoil, SunTrust's 30,000 employees remain "steadily focused every day on building our business, serving our current customers, and attracting new ones who find SunTrust's relative strength and stability a distinct competitive advantage in these uncertain times."
SunTrust's previously announced capital enhancing transactions were completed during the quarter and the results are reflected in the Company's capital ratios. Estimated Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2008 is a healthy 8.15%, up 68 basis points from 7.47% at June 30, 2008. The total capital ratio also increased and now exceeds 11%. In addition, the Company reported total average equity to total average assets of 10.34%, and a tangible equity to tangible asset ratio of 6.40% which is one of the highest ratios among large banks.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,460.9 million for the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 20.7% compared to the third quarter of 2007, driven by the securities gains from the contribution of the Coke stock, mark to market valuation gains on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value, and increased fee income. These items were partially offset by a 3.6% decline in net interest income, a decline in trust and investment management income, and the expected market valuation write-down of ARS.
For the nine months, fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $7,284.2 million, up 12.4% over prior year. The increase was driven by incremental net securities gains of $424.8 million, gains from the sale of non-strategic businesses and the sale/leaseback of certain corporate real estate properties, the Visa IPO gain, net positive mark-to-market valuations, and increased fee income from the Company's core businesses. These contributions to growth were partially offset by lower net interest income, trust and investment management income, and the write-down related to ARS.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,175.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, a decrease of 3.6% from the third quarter of 2007. Net interest margin declined 11 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2007. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest margin declined 6 basis points. The decline in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in nonaccrual loans, a reduction in Coke and Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") dividend income, LIBOR rate volatility during September in particular, and lower interest income associated with a small increase in the Company's leverage lease ("LILO") reserves. While earning assets remained essentially flat over the past twelve months, higher yielding assets, such as loans held for sale, have declined and lower yielding assets, such as commercial loans, have increased. Lower rates on customer and wholesale deposits, as well as growth in customer deposits, helped offset the decline in interest income.
For the nine months, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3,528.5 million, a decline of 2.7% from 2007 while net interest margin was relatively flat. Balance sheet management strategies initiated in 2007 led to a $3.8 billion, or 2.5%, decline in average earning assets, namely loans held for sale, real estate construction loans, and interest-earning trading assets, which was partially offset by growth in commercial loans.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1,285.2 million for the third quarter of 2008, up 56.9% from the third quarter of 2007. The third quarter of 2008 included the gain from the contribution of Coke stock of $183.4 million to a charitable foundation and a $81.8 million gain on the sale of TransPlatinum, a fuel card and fleet management subsidiary, as well as mark-to-market valuation gains on the Company's public debt and related hedges of $341.0 million versus a mark-to-market valuation gain of $63.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. The gains on the Company's public debt related to the widening in credit spreads across the entire financial institutions sector as a result of the global credit crisis. When stability in debt markets returns, spreads are expected to tighten, and, if this occurs, then these valuation gains will reverse. The third quarter of 2008 also included $172.8 million of expected losses related to ARS and $136.9 million in mark-to-market losses on illiquid trading securities and loan warehouses compared to $220.5 million in
 
mark-to-market losses in the third quarter of 2007. The fair value of the illiquid securities acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007 declined to approximately $350 million, from approximately $770 million as of June 30, 2008, primarily due to sales during the third quarter. This reduction was partially offset by the purchase in the third quarter of 2008 of a $70 million par value bond from an affiliated money market mutual fund. As of September 30, 2008, the fair value of this bond was $6.5 million.
The expected loss related to auction rate securities was recognized in trading account profits and commissions as a result of the Company's decision to offer to purchase ARS from certain clients and includes approximately $5 million in regulatory fines. The par value of the securities the Company will offer to purchase is approximately $725 million. Approximately $625 million of these securities are government sponsored securities or securities where the issuer has indicated support of the underlying assets. The remaining $100 million of securities pertains to a senior tranche within a securitization of trust preferred securities. We believe that the bulk of this write-down relates to liquidity and duration risks not the ultimate collectability of estimated cash flows. The majority of these securities are expected to be purchased in the fourth quarter.
Mortgage production income was $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $13.0 million in the third quarter of 2007. Lower loan production and related fees in 2008 were offset by a significant reduction in valuation losses recorded in the third quarter of 2007 on the Alt-A loans held in the warehouse. Mortgage servicing related income in the third quarter of 2008 increased primarily due to higher servicing fee income driven by growth in the servicing portfolio from $149.9 billion as of September 30, 2007 to $159.3 billion as of September 30, 2008. On a sequential quarter basis, servicing income increased primarily due to a $19.0 million gain on sale of excess servicing rights.
In the third quarter of 2008, the Company experienced strong growth in service charges on deposit accounts and card fees, which increased 12.3% and 10.9%, respectively, over the same period of 2007. Investment banking income grew 30.4%, related to increased loan syndication and capital markets activity; however, trust and investment income declined 15.8%, reflecting the sale of certain trust related businesses earlier in 2008 and lower fee income attributable to the decline in the equity markets. Trading account profits and commissions includes the mark-to-market valuation adjustments on financial instruments carried at fair value including the Company's publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value and the ARS expected loss. Securities gains included the $183.4 million gain from the contribution of Coke shares, partially offset by a $10.3 million charge for other-than-temporary impairment of certain securities available for sale.
For the nine months, total noninterest income was $3,755.7 million, which was 31.7% over the same period of 2007. The increase was largely due to the following transaction-related gains:
 
Partially offsetting these gains was the expected market valuation write-down of $172.8 million related to ARS and securities losses recorded primarily in the first and third quarters of 2008 totaling $75.1 million in conjunction with available-for-sale securities that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
For the first nine months of 2008, SunTrust experienced solid growth in most noninterest income categories, including service charges on deposits accounts, up $82.6 million, other fees up, $28.4 million, card fees up, $27.2 million, investment banking income up, $18.7 million, and retail investment income up, $12.5 million. Trading account profits and commissions increased $24.6 million over the first nine months of 2007 as positive mark-to-market gains on the Company's public debt net of related hedges exceeded mark-to-market losses on illiquid securities during 2008, as compared to net mark-to-market losses during 2007.
 
Mortgage production income increased 190.1% over the first nine months of 2007 due to the recognition of servicing value at the time of the interest rate lock commitment in accordance with recently adopted accounting standards, partially offset by a decline in loan production. The prior period also included the impact of mortgage spread widening related to Alt-A loans held in the mortgage loan warehouse, which have been substantially eliminated, and $42.2 million of income reductions recorded in conjunction with our adoption of specific fair value accounting standards. Drivers behind changes in other components of noninterest income categories were consistent with those impacting the third quarter.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2008 was $1,668.1 million, up 29.2% from the third quarter of 2007. Almost half of the increase was related to the $183.4 million contribution of Coke stock to our charitable foundation recognized in marketing and customer development. The majority of the remaining increase was due to credit-related expenses, which increased $178.2 million over the third quarter of 2007. Credit-related expenses include fraud losses primarily related to borrower misrepresentations on mortgage loan documentation, other real estate losses, credit and collection costs, and additions to mortgage insurance reserves. Additionally, SunTrust increased its estimate of future liability related to VISA litigation by $20 million as a result of a tentative settlement. Excluding the charitable contribution, VISA litigation, and credit-related items, expenses were well controlled as a result of the Company's E
2
Efficiency and Productivity Program, which through the third quarter 2008 has generated gross savings of approximately $397 million. Personnel expenses in the third quarter of 2008 increased 2.7% from the same period in 2007. Salaries declined $8.6 million from the third quarter of 2007, reflecting a reduction of approximately 3,500 full time equivalent employees since September 30, 2007 to 29,447 as of quarter end 2008. The increase in personnel expense is due primarily to the annual issuance of restricted stock, and in the third quarter of 2007, a year-to-date downward adjustment to incentive accruals. Other expenses in the third quarter of 2007 included a $45.0 million accrual for severance costs related to the E
2
program and a $9.8 million debt extinguishment charge, partially offset by a $33.6 million reduction of the accrued liability related to a capital instrument. On a sequential quarter basis, the increase in outside processing was substantially offset by the decrease in employee compensation and benefits due to the outsourcing of certain back-office operations in the third quarter of 2008.
For the nine months, total noninterest expense was $4,301.8 million, an increase of 13.9% over the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to increased credit-related costs of $290.7 million, the contribution of Coke stock of $183.4 million, and the mortgage origination costs that were previously deferred prior to the Company's election during the second quarter of 2007 to record at fair value certain newly originated mortgage loans held-for-sale.
Income Taxes
The Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $52.8 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to a provision for income taxes of $152.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in income taxes was due to lower taxable income and the recognition of a $68.5 million tax benefit from the charitable contribution of 3.6 million Coke shares.
 
Balance Sheet
As of September 30, 2008, SunTrust had total assets of $174.8 billion. Shareholders' equity of $18.0 billion as of September 30, 2008 represented 10.27% of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were $49.32 and $30.27 as of September 30, 2008, respectively.
Loans
Average loans for the third quarter of 2008 were $125.6 billion, up $6.1 billion, or 5.1%, from the third quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily in commercial-related categories. Average construction loans declined $3.2 billion, or 23.3%, due to the Company's efforts to reduce its exposure to construction loans and the transfer to nonaccrual loans. Indirect auto loans declined $0.8 billion, or 10.2%, driven by SunTrust's de-emphasis of this business. Average loans held-for-sale also declined $5.3 billion, or 54.3%, as loan originations declined 35.5%, production shifted to predominantly agency products, and efficiency improved in loan delivery. On a sequential quarter basis, total average loans increased slightly with the product trends remaining consistent.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter of 2008 were $100.2 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 3.6%, from the third quarter of 2007, as increases in NOW and money market deposits were partially offset by declines in demand deposit and savings account balances. Average brokered deposits declined $5.1 billion, or 32.3%, from the third quarter of 2007 as consumer and commercial interest bearing deposits increased $4.1 billion. On a sequential quarter basis, total average deposits decreased $0.8 billion, or 0.7%, driven by reductions in most deposit categories. The decline in average balances was driven largely by decreases experienced in July and August, as September reversed this trend with growing balances, particularly in the later part of the month.
Capital
The estimated Tier 1 capital, total average shareholders' equity to total average assets, and tangible equity to tangible assets ratios at September 30, 2008 were 8.15%, 10.34%, and 6.40%, respectively. This compares to 7.44%, 10.05%, and 6.36% at September 30, 2007 and 7.47%, 10.31%, and 6.27% at June 30, 2008. The increases are primarily attributable to completion of the Coke transactions. The Company's regulatory capital ratios are significantly in excess of the regulatory requirements for well capitalized status.
Asset Quality
Nonaccrual loans were $3,289.5 million, or 2.60%, of total loans as of September 30, 2008, compared to $2,625.3 million, or 2.09%, of total loans as of June 30, 2008 and $974.8 million, or 0.81%, of total loans as of September 30, 2007. The increase in nonaccrual loans was mainly due to an increase in real estate construction loans and residential mortgages, as the overall weakening of the housing markets and economy continued to increase delinquencies. Other real estate owned also increased $52.5 million, or 15.7%, to $387.0 million, as the Company foreclosed on the collateral securing specific nonperforming loans. Restructured loans still accruing interest increased $217.7 million to $381.0 million as a result of actions the Company is proactively taking to mitigate further losses and enable borrowers to repay their loans under revised terms that in the long run preserve the value of the Company's interests.
 
Annualized quarterly net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2008 were 1.24% of average loans, up from 0.34% in the third quarter of 2007 and 1.04% in the second quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs were $392.1 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $322.7 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $103.7 million in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in net charge-offs over the third quarter of 2007 reflects the deterioration in consumer credit and home values, particularly in residential real estate secured loans. The increase in net charge-offs in 2008 has been most pronounced in home equity lines, residential mortgages, and construction loans as home values continued to fall. The provision for loan losses increased to $503.7 million compared to $448.0 million in the second quarter of 2008 and $147.0 million in the third quarter of 2007.
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $1,941.0 million as of September 30, 2008 and represented 1.54% of period-end loans. Since year-end 2007, the allowance to loans outstanding has increased 49 basis points, as the deterioration in certain segments of the consumer and residential real estate market continued. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of September 30, 2008 represented 1.24 times annualized net charge-offs in the quarter and 62.1% of period-end nonperforming loans.
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The following discussion details results for SunTrust's four business lines: Retail and Commercial Banking, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage, and Wealth and Investment Management. In 2007, the Company reported five business segments.
All revenue is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the lines of business, results include net interest income, which is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing. Further, provision for loan losses is represented by net charge-offs.
SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other and Treasury, which includes the Treasury department, as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. This segment also includes differences created between internal management accounting practices and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges, differences in loan loss provision compared to net charge-offs, as well as equity and its related impact.
Retail and Commercial Banking
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $64.7 million, a decrease of $138.1 million, or 68.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision expense due to home equity line and commercial net charge-offs, lower deposit related net interest income and higher credit and fraud related noninterest expense, partially offset by strong growth in service charges on deposits.
Net interest income decreased $51.6 million, or 7.3%, driven by a shift in deposit mix and compressed spreads due to increased competition for deposits. Average deposits increased $0.9 billion, or 1.1%, while deposit spreads decreased 18 basis points resulting in a $32.8 million decrease in net interest income. Low cost demand deposit and savings accounts decreased a combined $1.3 billion, or 6.7%, primarily in commercial demand deposits while higher cost NOW and money market accounts increased a combined $2.6 billion, or 7.4%. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts dropped $0.4 billion, or 1.7%, although spreads increased slightly. Net interest
 
income from loans decreased $11.8 million as average loan balances declined $0.5 billion, or 1.0%. Average loan balances declined approximately $2.2 billion related to the migration of middle market clients from the Retail and Commercial line of business to Wholesale Banking. This decline was substantially offset by loan growth from the GB&T acquisition, commercial loans, equity lines, and student loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $151.1 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity lines, reflecting deterioration in the residential real estate market, and commercial loans, primarily to clients with annual revenue of less then $5 million.
Total noninterest income increased $30.2 million, or 9.4%, from the third quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $22.1 million, or 11.6%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts from both consumer and business accounts primarily due to growth in the number of accounts, higher NSF rates and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $7.4 million, or 14.6%, and ATM revenue increased $3.0 million, or 10.1%.
Total noninterest expense increased $47.1 million, or 7.4%, from the third quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by higher credit related expenses including operating losses due to fraud, shared corporate overhead expense, and continued investment in the branch distribution network.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $283.0 million, a decrease of $329.5 million, or 53.8%, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision expense due to home equity line net charge-offs, lower net interest income related to deposit spreads and higher credit-related noninterest expense, partially offset by strong growth in service charges on deposits.
Net interest income decreased $201.4 million, or 9.4%, driven by a continued shift in deposit mix and decreased spreads as deposit competition and the interest rate environment encouraged customers to migrate into higher yielding interest-bearing deposits. Average deposit balances increased $0.4 billion, or 0.5%, while deposit spreads decreased 30 basis points resulting in a $172.7 million decrease in net interest income. Low cost demand deposit and savings accounts decreased a combined $1.9 billion, or 9.4%, driven by a decrease in commercial demand, while higher cost NOW and money market accounts increased a combined $2.4 billion, or 7.0%. Net interest income from loans decreased $21.8 million, or 2.8%, as average loan balances declined $0.4 billion, or 0.8%. The transfer of middle market clients to the Wholesale Banking line of business decreased loans by approximately $2.1 billion and was partially offset by loans acquired in the GB&T acquisition and growth in commercial loans, equity lines and student loans.
Provision for loan losses increased $409.0 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity lines, indirect auto, as well as in commercial loans primarily to clients with annual revenue of less then $5 million.
Total noninterest income increased $101.6 million, or 11.0%, over the same period in 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $69.2 million, or 13.0%, increase in service charges on both consumer and business deposit accounts, primarily due to growth in the number of accounts,
 
higher NSF rates and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $22.3 million, or 15.0%, while ATM revenue also increased $7.1 million, or 8.0%.
Total noninterest expense increased $15.9 million, or 0.8%, from the same period in 2007. The continuing positive impact of expense savings initiatives was offset by higher credit-related expenses, including operating losses due to fraud, and continued investments in the branch distribution network.
Wholesale Banking
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $42.1 million, an increase of $9.7 million, or 30.2%, compared to the third quarter of 2007. Lower mark-to-market trading losses and higher investment banking income was partially offset by higher incentive based compensation as well as decreased net interest income and increased provision expense.
Net interest income decreased $10.8 million, or 7.6%. While average loan balances increased $5.2 billion, or 17.7%, the corresponding net interest income declined $13.1 million, or 11.4%. Approximately $2.2 billion of the increase is related to the migration of middle market clients from the Retail and Commercial line of business to the Wholesale Banking line of business. Average loans in the legacy Wholesale Banking line of business increased approximately $3.1 billion, or 10.5%, driven by growth from large corporate clients partially offset by reductions in the residential builder portfolio. The decline in loan related net interest income is due to a shift in mix away from higher spread residential construction loans to lower spread commercial loans, as well as increased residential construction nonaccrual loans. Total average deposits were up $4.0 billion, or 75.8%, primarily in higher cost corporate money market and Eurodollar accounts. The net interest income associated with the higher-cost deposit categories was relatively flat as the additional volume was offset by lower deposit spreads.
Provision for loan losses was $32.3 million, an increase of $16.8 million, or 108.9%, from the same period in 2007. The increase resulted from higher residential builder-related charge-offs partially offset by lower charge-offs from large corporate clients.
Total noninterest income increased $85.8 million, or 118.4%. Solid performance in loan syndications, fixed income sales, direct finance, equity offerings and leasing, as well as lower mark-to-market trading losses primarily related to structured products, were in part offset by lower revenues in bond origination and structured leasing.
Total noninterest expense increased $24.2 million, or 13.5%. The migration of middle market clients accounted for approximately $6.7 million of the increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking expenses increased $17.5 million, or 9.8%, driven primarily by higher incentive-based compensation primarily related to an increase in noninterest income, partially offset by lower Affordable Housing related and discretionary expenses.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $206.5 million, a decrease of $37.3 million, or 15.3%, compared to the same period in 2007. Lower
 
mark-to-market trading losses were offset by reductions in private equity gains, higher incentive based compensation, as well as decreased net interest income and increased provision expense.
Net interest income decreased $26.3 million, or 6.1%. Average loan balances increased $4.4 billion, or 15.1%, while the corresponding net interest income declined $23.2 million, or 6.7%. Approximately $2.1 billion of the loan increase is related to the migration of middle market clients from the Retail and Commercial line of business to the Wholesale Banking line of business. Average loans in the legacy Wholesale line of business increased $2.3 billion, or 8.0%, driven by increased corporate banking loans which were partially offset by reductions in the residential builder portfolio. The decline in net interest income is due to a shift in mix away from higher spread residential construction loans to lower spread commercial loans and increased residential construction nonaccrual loans. Total average deposits were up $4.1 billion, or 82.4%, primarily in higher cost corporate money market and Eurodollar accounts. The associated net interest income decreased $5.5 million driven by the lower credit for funds on demand deposits. The net interest income associated with the higher-cost deposit categories was relatively flat as the additional volume was offset by the lower deposit spreads.
Provision for loan losses was $55.6 million, an increase of $21.7 million, or 64.1%, from the same period in 2007, resulting from higher residential builder related charge-offs partially offset by lower charge-offs in corporate banking.
Total noninterest income increased $49.8 million, or 10.7%. Lower mark-to-market trading losses mainly affecting structured products was the main driver of the increase. Solid performance in loan syndications, fixed income and equity sales and trading, equity offerings and leasing were, in part, offset by a reduction in private equity gains and lower revenues in structured leasing, derivatives and M&A advisory.
Total noninterest expense increased $38.6 million, or 6.8%. The transfer of middle market clients accounted for approximately $19.7 million of the increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking's expense increased $18.9 million, or 3.4%, driven primarily by higher incentive-based compensation primarily related to a 45% increase in Capital Markets noninterest income. In addition, higher outside processing and credit services expenses were partially offset by lower Affordable Housing, personnel, and discretionary expenses.
Mortgage
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage reported a net loss of $156.1 million for the third quarter of 2008, a $143.6 million higher loss compared with the third quarter of 2007. The larger net loss was principally due to higher credit-related costs.
Net interest income declined $23.5 million, or 18.0%. Average loans increased $1.0 billion, or 3.4%, while net interest income on loans declined $19.9 million, or 22.8%. This decline was principally due to a $1.2 billion increase in average nonaccrual loans which resulted in $12.1 million of the net interest income decline. Additionally, average consumer mortgage and residential construction loans declined $0.3 billion resulting in a net interest income decline of $7.4 million. Also contributing to the decrease was a $4.0 million decline in net interest income on deposits primarily related to a lower credit for funds on demand deposits.
 
Provision for loan losses increased $113.1 million over the $11.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007 due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $38.5 million, or 42.8%. Mortgage production income increased $29.6 million, or 148.4%. Total loan production of $8.1 billion was down $4.5 billion, or 35.5%; however, valuation losses due to spread widening in the mortgage market were lower in 2008 and offset the negative effect of lower loan production. Servicing income increased $5.8 million, or 10.2%. Higher service fees due to a larger servicing portfolio were only partially offset by higher Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSR") amortization. Total loans serviced at September 30, 2008 were $159.3 billion compared with $149.9 billion at September 30, 2007.
Total noninterest expense increased $129.7 million, or 55.0%. Operating losses increased $71.6 million principally driven by fraud related to borrower misrepresentation, while reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $47.9 million. Other real estate and collection services expenses increased $38.1 million. Commission expense was down $19.5 million due to lower loan production as were other origination-related expenses.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage reported a net loss of $276.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, a decrease of $312.7 million compared to net income of $35.9 million reported in the same period in 2007 principally due to credit-related costs and lower servicing income.
Net interest income declined $33.2 million, or 8.4%. Average loans increased $1.0 billion, or 3.2%, while the resulting net interest income declined $48.2 million. This decline was principally due to a $1.1 billion increase in average nonaccrual loans which contributed $32.6 million to the decline in net interest income. Additionally, the changing mix in portfolio assets drove an income decline of $15.5 million, as declining construction perm and Alt A balances were replaced with lower yielding prime first lien mortgages. Average deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 5.1%, while the resulting net interest income decreased $6.4 million due primarily to lower funds credit for demand deposits. Partially offsetting the decline was higher income from loans held for sale of $26.7 million due to wider spreads and higher income from mortgage-backed securities of $19.4 million.
Provision for loan losses increased $316.1 million, to $351.1 million from $35.0 million, due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $103.9 million, or 39.1%. Total loan production of $29.2 billion was down $16.2 billion, or 35.7%, from the prior year. While production income was negatively affected by lower loan production, total production income increased $138.9 million, or 200.9%, due to lower valuation losses resulting from spread widening in the mortgage market in 2008 and recognition of loan origination fees resulting from the Company's election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007. Servicing income was down principally due to higher MSR amortization and hedge costs and lower gains on sale of mortgage servicing assets. These declines were partially offset by higher service fees due to a larger servicing portfolio. Total loans serviced at September 30, 2008 were $159.3 billion compared with $149.9 billion at September 30, 2007.
Total noninterest expense increased $254.5 million, or 43.5%. Operating losses increased $101.8 million principally driven by fraud related to borrower misrepresentation. Reserves for
 
mortgage reinsurance losses increased $79.8 million while other real estate expense and collection services expense increased $70.8 million. Additionally, the recognition of loan origination costs resulting from the Company's election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007 increased noninterest expense compared with the prior year. These increases were partially offset by lower commission expense which was down $58.7 million due to lower loan production.
Wealth and Investment Management
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $4.4 million, a decrease of $56.8 million, or 92.8%. The decline in net income was primarily the result of a mark-to-market loss on a single security. In September 2008, the Company purchased $70 million of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman") bonds, at par, from the RidgeWorth Prime Quality Money Market Fund in order to protect SunTrust clients from possible losses associated with Lehman's default. Subsequent to purchase, a $63.5 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss was recorded reflecting the fair value as of September 30, 2008.
Net interest income decreased $3.1 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to compressed spreads on loans and deposits. Average deposits were down 0.3% and net interest income declined $1.6 million, or 2.9%, primarily related to a lower credit for funds on demand deposits. Average loans increased $0.4 billion, or 4.7%, driven by a $240.7 million increase in commercial loans. However, the increase in balances was offset by decreased spreads in both the consumer and commercial portfolios resulting in a $2.3 million decrease in net interest income.
Provision for loan losses increased $7.2 million primarily due to higher home equity, consumer direct, and consumer mortgage net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income decreased $96.7 million, or 37.4%, driven by the $63.5 million mark-to-market loss on the Lehman bonds and the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust. Retail investment income increased $0.9 million, or 1.3%, due to higher annuity sales and recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $27.5 million, or 15.7%, primarily due to lower revenue streams stemming from the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust and lower market valuations on managed equity assets. As of September 30, 2008, assets under management were approximately $129.5 billion compared to $142.9 billion as of September 30, 2007. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, institutional assets managed by RidgeWorth Capital Management, and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $218.3 billion, which includes $129.5 billion in assets under management, $51.4 billion in non-managed trust assets, $35.9 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $1.7 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.
Total noninterest expense decreased $17.5 million, or 7.1%, driven by lower staff and discretionary expenses, as well as lower structural expense resulting from the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust.
 
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $153.3 million, a decrease of $30.5 million, or 16.6%, from the prior year. The following transactions represented $13.6 million of the year-over-year decline:
 
Net interest income decreased $17.1 million, or 6.4%, primarily due to a shift in deposit mix to higher cost deposits. Average deposits were practically unchanged as declines in demand deposits and savings accounts were offset by increases in higher-cost NOW and money market accounts. This shift in deposit mix coupled with compressed spreads due to increased competition for deposits resulted in a $13.2 million decrease in net interest income. Average loans increased slightly as growth in commercial loans was partially offset by declines in higher spread consumer loans resulting in a $3.6 million decline in net interest income.
Provision for loan losses increased $10.9 million, or 183.9%, driven by higher home equity, consumer direct, and consumer mortgage net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income decreased $32.1 million, or 4.0%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2007 driven by the $63.5 million mark-to-market loss on Lehman bonds. This decline was partially offset by a $29.6 million gain on sale of First Mercantile Trust and $28.7 million of incremental revenue from the sale of our Lighthouse Partners investment. Retail investment income increased $9.6 million, or 4.7%, due to higher annuity sales and higher recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $48.0 million, or 9.4%, primarily due to the aforementioned sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust which resulted in a $37.4 million decline in trust income.
Total noninterest expense decreased $9.6 million, or 1.3%. This decline includes a $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible incurred in the second quarter of 2008. Noninterest expense before intangible amortization declined $50.9 million, or 6.8%, driven by lower staff, discretionary, and indirect expenses, as well as lower structural expense resulting from the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust.
 
Corporate Other and Treasury
Three Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $357.4 million, an increase of $221.0 million, or 162.0%, compared to the third quarter of 2007. The increase was driven by the release of a deferred tax liability related to the charitable contribution of Coke stock, net positive valuations on long-term debt and related hedges carried at fair value, lower mark-to-market losses on trading securities and the gain on sale of the TransPlatinum subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by the expected market valuation write-down of auction rate securities and an increase in provision for loan losses.
Net interest income increased $45.5 million, or 29.5%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to interest risk management activities. Total average assets decreased $4.0 billion, or 17.6%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio as part of the Company's overall balance sheet management strategy. Total average deposits decreased $6.7 billion, or 31.1%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered deposits, as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $68.4 million, or 157.8%, due to a higher increase in the Company's allowance for loan losses.
Total noninterest income increased $408.3 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. Of the increase, $278.0 million was driven by net valuation gains on publicly-traded debt. These net valuation gains are primarily due to the significant widening in credit spreads on the Company's publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value. There was also an increase of $177.7 million in securities gains primarily from the gain on the contribution of Coke stock and a gain of $81.8 million on sale of the TransPlatinum subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by the expected market valuation write-down of $172.8 million on auction rate securities.
Total noninterest expense increased $193.3 million compared to the third quarter of 2007. The increase in expense was mainly due to a $183.4 million charitable contribution of Coke stock, and increase in the VISA related litigation liability.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $777.3 million, an increase of $230.5 million, or 42.1%, from the same period in 2007. The increase was driven by securities gains primarily related to the incremental gains on the sale and contribution of Coke stock, net valuation gains on the Company's publicly-traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value, and the gain on sale of the TransPlatinum subsidiary. These increases were partially offset by the expected market valuation write-down of auction rate securities, mark-to-market valuation losses on illiquid trading securities and provision for loan losses.
Net interest income increased $178.9 million, or 45.7%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to interest rate risk management activities. Total average assets decreased $6.1 billion, or 22.9%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of trading assets. Total average deposits decreased
 
$9.4 billion, or 38.8%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, increased $445.8 million in conjunction with an increase in the allowance for loan losses due primarily to expected deterioration in the residential real estate market and related loan credit quality.
Total noninterest income increased $680.0 million compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to a $497.4 increase in gains on the sale and contribution of Coke stock. Additionally, there was an $86.3 million gain on holdings of VISA in connection with its initial public offering, an $81.8 million gain on sale of TransPlatinum, and an additional $37.0 million gain from the sale/leaseback of real estate properties. Noninterest income also included an additional increase of $442.9 million of net positive mark-to-market valuations on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value. These valuations reflect the widening in the credit spreads on SunTrust's publicly-traded debt carried at fair value. These gains were partially offset by $176.6 million in net valuation losses on illiquid trading securities, an expected loss of $172.8 million on ARS, an $81.0 million decrease due to gains on trading assets and liabilities recorded in 2007 related to the Company's adoption of fair value, and a $58.4 million increase in securities losses during this period primarily driven by market value impairment related to certain asset-backed securities that were estimated to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
Total noninterest expense increased $223.9 million from the same period in 2007. The increase in expense was mainly due to the $183.4 million charitable contribution of Coke stock, and an increase in the VISA related litigation liability.

Exhibit 99.3
The risks listed here are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects.
Recent Market, Legislative, and Regulatory Events
Difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry.
Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. These write-downs, initially of asset-backed securities but spreading to other securities and loans, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provision for credit losses. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry.
Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.
The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. Recently, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation will stabilize the U.S. financial system.
On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the "EESA"). The legislation was the result of a proposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to the U.S. Congress in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury will have the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Department of Treasury announced a program under the EESA pursuant to which it would make senior preferred stock investments in participating financial institutions (the "TARP Capital Purchase Program"). On October 14, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced the development of a
guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the Federal Deposit Act ("FDA") pursuant to which the FDIC would offer a guarantee of certain financial institution indebtedness in exchange for an insurance premium to be paid to the FDIC by issuing financial institutions (the "FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program").
There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the EESA and its implementing regulations, the FDIC programs, or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets. The failure of the EESA, the FDIC, or the U.S. government to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock.
The impact on us of recently enacted legislation, in particular the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and its implementing regulations, and actions by the FDIC, cannot be predicted at this time.
The programs established or to be established under the EESA and Troubled Asset Relief Program may have adverse effects upon us. We may face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in specific programs may subject us to additional restrictions. For example, participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program will limit (without the consent of the Department of Treasury) our ability to increase our dividend or to repurchase our common stock for so long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding. It will also subject us to additional executive compensation restrictions. Similarly, programs established by the FDIC under the systemic risk exception of the FDA, whether we participate or not, may have an adverse effect on us. Participation in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program likely will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC. We may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums even if we do not participate in the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. The affects of participating or not participating in any such programs, and the extent of our participation in such programs cannot reliably be determined at this time.
Business Risks
Credit risk.
When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts. A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the nation's largest lenders, the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfunded credit commitments). This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify.
Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us.
If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations declines, or continues to decline, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration of credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for loan and lease losses. A significant portion of our residential mortgages and commercial real estate loan portfolios are composed of borrowers in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, in which certain markets have been particularly adversely affected by declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us.
Significant ongoing disruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans have limited the market for and liquidity of many mortgage loans. The effects of ongoing mortgage market challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could result in further price reductions in single family home values, adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations and profits on sale of mortgage loans. Declining real estate prices and higher interest rates have caused higher delinquencies and losses on certain mortgage loans, particularly Alt-A mortgages and home equity lines of credit and mortgage loans sourced from brokers that are outside our branch bank network. These trends could continue. These conditions have resulted in losses, write downs and impairment charges in our mortgage and other lines of business. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgage loans or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, decreases in real estate values might adversely affect the creditworthiness of state and local governments, and this might result in decreased profitability or credit losses from loans made to such governments. A decline in home values could or overall economic weakness could also have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which we own upon foreclosing a loan.
As a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on our business:
 
Changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.
Given our business mix, and the fact that most of the assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets. In addition to the impact on the general economy, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways:
 
The fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. They also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"). Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.
We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
When we sell mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation or warranty in connection with our securitizations. The remedies available to us against the originating broker or correspondent may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against us, and we face the further risk that the originating broker or correspondent may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to us. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover our losses from the originating broker or correspondent. Recently, we have received an increased number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers as a result of borrower fraud and early borrower payment defaults. While we have taken steps to enhance our underwriting policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be effective nor impact risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
Clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.
Checking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if clients perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing superior expected returns. When clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding costs.
Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income.
Technology and other changes now allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits.
We have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks.
We are a diversified financial services company. This diversity subjects earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties.
Hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business.
Large scale natural disasters may significantly affect loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans. The nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The ultimate impact of a natural disaster on future financial results is difficult to predict and will be affected by a number of factors, including the extent of damage to the collateral, the extent to which damaged collateral is not covered by insurance, the extent to which unemployment and other economic conditions caused by the natural disaster adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay their loans, and the cost of collection and foreclosure moratoriums, loan forbearances and other accommodations granted to borrowers and other clients.
Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues.
As a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our customers' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract and/or retain clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by one of our businesses can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to its access to unsecured wholesale borrowings; significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources of funding.
We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.
Third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in our business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.
We rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations.
We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and record-keeping errors, and computer/telecommunications systems malfunctions. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. We are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including relating to break-downs or failures of such parties' own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate one or more of our businesses, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materially adversely affect us.
We may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages or natural disasters, or events arising from local or regional politics, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us. In addition there is the risk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.
We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.
In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.
Industry Risks
We are heavily regulated by federal and state agencies. This regulation is to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us adversely, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Also, if we do not comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could receive regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation.
Regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue and profit margins.
Competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins.
We operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks
and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and/or face fewer regulatory constraints. As a result of these various sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability.
Future legislation could harm our competitive position.
Congress occasionally considers proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system and to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any regulations, would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.
Maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.
Our success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or development in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases.
We may not pay dividends on your common stock.
Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, our ability to increase our dividend or to make other distributions may be restricted if we elect to participate in certain recently announced programs developed under the EESA. For example, participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program will limit (without the consent of the Department of Treasury) our ability to increase our dividend or to repurchase our common stock for so long as any securities issued under such program remain outstanding.
Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends.
We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, including SunTrust Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on common stock. Additionally, if our subsidiaries' earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders.
Significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities.
We are from time to time subject to claims related to our operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause
significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Company Risks
Recently declining values of real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.
We offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market area. A major change in the real estate market, such as deterioration in the value of this collateral, or in the local or national economy, could adversely affect our customer's ability to pay these loans, which in turn could impact us. Risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result credit losses may occur in the future.
Deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us.
We have experienced a downturn in credit performance, which became significant in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 and which continues. We expect credit conditions and the performance of our loan portfolio to continue to deteriorate in the near term. This deterioration has resulted in an increase in our loan loss reserves throughout 2008, which increases were driven primarily by residential and commercial real estate and home equity portfolios. Additional increases in loan loss reserves may be necessary in the future. Deterioration in the quality of our credit portfolio can have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.
Disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity.
In managing our consolidated balance sheet, we depend on access to global capital markets to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Other sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity risk management strategy, include inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity.
Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.
Although our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt was downgraded during 2008 by one of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital.
We have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits.
We have historically pursued an acquisition strategy, and intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into the existing operations, or expand into new markets. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability, or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies, and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. We may not properly ascertain all such risks prior to an acquisition or prior to such a risk impacting us
while integrating an acquired company. As a result, difficulties encountered with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Furthermore, we must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, future prospects, including current and projected capital levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management, compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution's record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. In addition, we cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. Consequently, we might be required to sell portions of the acquired institution as a condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it.
We depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer.
The success of our business has been, and the continuing success will be, dependent to a large degree on the continued services of executive officers, especially our President and Chief Executive Officer, James M. Wells III, and other key personnel who have extensive experience in the industry. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of the executive officers or other key personnel. If we lose the services of any of these integral personnel and fail to manage a smooth transition to new personnel, the business could be impacted.
We may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement the business strategy.
Our success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated, well-qualified personnel. We face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees. Our ability to execute the business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer if we are unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially.
Our accounting policies and methods are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.
Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report the financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("US GAAP").
Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management's judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements. See the "Critical Accounting Policies" in the MD&A and Note 1, "Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 for more information.
Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.
Our stock price can be volatile.
Our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including:
 
General market fluctuations, industry factors, and general economic and political conditions and events, such as terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends, or currency fluctuations, also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.
Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks.
We maintain an available for sale securities portfolio and trading assets which include various types of instruments and maturities. In addition, we elected to record selected fixed-rate debt, mortgage loans, securitization warehouses and other trading assets at fair value. The changes in fair value of the financial instruments elected to be carried at fair value pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 159 are recognized in earnings. The financial instruments carried at fair value are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates, market liquidity, and our market-based credit spreads, as well as to the risk of default by specific borrowers. We manage the market risks associated with these instruments through active hedging arrangements or broader asset/liability management strategies. Changes in the market values of these financial instruments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may classify additional financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value in the future.
Our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks.
We generally maintain investment portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets. Unrealized gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio and mark to market gains and losses associated with our trading portfolio are affected by many factors, including our credit position, interest rate volatility, volatility in capital markets and other economic factors. Our return on such investments and trading have in the past experienced, and will likely in the future experience, volatility and such volatility may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, accounting regulations may require us to record a charge prior to the actual realization of a loss when market valuations of such securities are impaired and such impairment is considered to be other than temporary.
We may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.
We engage in a variety of transactions with off-balance sheet entities with which we are affiliated. While we have no obligation, contractual or otherwise, to do so, under certain limited circumstances, these transactions may involve providing some form of financial support to these entities. Any such actions may cause us to recognize current or future gains or losses. Depending on the nature and magnitude of any transactions we enter into with off-balance
sheet entities, accounting rules may require us to consolidate the financial results of these entities with our financial results.
We are subject to market risk associated with our asset management and commercial paper conduit businesses.
During 2007 and 2008, we recorded market valuation losses related to securities that we purchased from certain money market funds managed by our subsidiary RidgeWorth Capital Management, Inc. as well as Three Pillars Funding, LLC ("Three Pillars"), a multi-seller commercial paper conduit sponsored by us. At the time of purchase, these securities were predominantly AAA or AA-rated, residential mortgage-backed securities, structured investment vehicle ("SIVs") securities, and corporate and consumer collateralized debt obligations. We cannot assure you that we will not sustain additional losses in the future related to these securities or the purchase of similar securities. The value of such securities may be affected by, among other things, a lack of liquidity in the market for these securities, deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying collateral, risks associated with the financial guarantees insuring the securities, and/or the fact that the respective investment vehicle enters restructuring proceedings. Such occurrences may materially adversely affect our financial condition, capital adequacy and results of operations.
