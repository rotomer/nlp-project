For Immediate Release
January 22, 2009
 
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) reported net income available to common shareholders of $746.9 million, or $2.13 per average common diluted share, for 2008 compared to $1,603.7 million, or $4.55 per average common diluted share in 2007. Net income available to common shareholders in the fourth quarter was a loss of $379.2 million, or $1.08 per average common diluted share, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.01 per average common diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company's 2008 and fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by credit-related charges that reflect the dramatic deterioration in the economy, especially during the fourth quarter.
"The fact that SunTrust is not alone in paying the price of a deteriorating economy on our business and our clients does not make today's results any less painful to report," said James M. Wells III, SunTrust Chairman and CEO. Mr. Wells noted that increased unemployment and continued declines in home values drove loan delinquencies significantly higher during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in higher than expected credit losses. "We are under no illusions as to the severity of this credit cycle," he added. "Managing successfully through it remains our number one priority."
Mr. Wells said the significant increase in the fourth quarter provision for loan losses from the prior quarter covered current loan charge-offs and also strengthened the Company's allowance for loan losses. He noted that the Company concluded 2008 "in a very strong regulatory capital position and with excellent liquidity." Mr. Wells further noted that, "despite our strong capital position, given the strain on earnings from increased credit costs and the challenging revenue environment, SunTrust's Board of Directors has decided to reduce the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per common share outstanding until the economic environment and earnings outlook improve."
"Through this cycle, we will continue to take the steps appropriate to maintain the Company's fundamental financial strength that is never more important than in a time of economic stress and uncertainty," said Mr. Wells. "At the same time, our people will continue to focus on serving our clients' needs, making good loans, generating core deposits, and running our business more efficiently. While understandably eclipsed right now by recession-related credit concerns, the positive momentum generated by these efforts will help us deliver the long-term shareholder value to which we remain committed."
Credit and Market Environment
The Company recorded provision for loan losses of $962.5 million, or $410.0 million in excess of net charge-offs, increasing the allowance for loan losses to 1.86% of total loans during the fourth quarter. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the Company recorded $236.1 million in operating losses, which were primarily related to losses stemming from borrower misrepresentations and insurance claim denials, and $100.0 million related to mortgage reinsurance reserves.
The worsening economic conditions and resulting affect on asset values also continued to adversely impact the Company's assets carried at fair market value. During the fourth quarter, market valuation
losses on loans and securities carried at fair value were approximately $145 million, of which $44.3 million related to the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value.
Balance Sheet Growth
During the fourth quarter, the Company issued $4.85 billion of preferred stock and warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Plan, significantly increasing the Company's capital position. As of December 31, 2008, SunTrust's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.39%, and the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.85%. The Company also issued $3.0 billion of debt guaranteed by the FDIC under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The additional capital and debt enhances SunTrust's solid capital and liquidity position, and improves, among other items, the Company's ability to meet the borrowing needs of clients and prospects throughout the economic downturn.
During the fourth quarter, average loans and consumer and commercial deposits increased 6.3% and 8.1%, respectively, on a sequential quarter annualized basis. Both consumer and commercial loan categories showed growth, which was partially offset by a decline in construction loans. Core deposit growth was particularly evident at the end of the quarter, and given the Company's strong liquidity position, brokered and foreign deposits were reduced by over 40% at year end as compared to September 30, 2008.
Financial Highlights
 
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $1,926.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $155.6 million, or 8.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to a decline in market valuation losses in 2008 as compared to 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, market valuation losses declined to $100.2 million from $639.5 million related to the write-down of certain asset-backed securities and mortgage loans as the investment in those assets has been substantially curtailed. The reduction in valuation losses was partially offset by an increase of approximately $129 million in net mark to market losses on the Company's debt and related hedges carried at fair value, due to tightening of the Company's credit spread, as well as declines in mortgage production income and trust and investment management income. The fourth quarter of 2007 also included a $118.8 million net gain from sale/leaseback of certain corporate real estate properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $9,210.6 million, an increase of $959.7 million, or 11.6%, over 2007. The increase was due to incremental securities gains, gains from the sale of non-strategic businesses, gain on Visa interest, lower net mark to market valuation losses, and increased fee income from core businesses. Partially offsetting these contributions to growth were declines in trust income, net interest income, and lower gains on sale/leaseback transactions.
 
Net Interest Income
For the fourth quarter of 2008, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,208.7 million, up $13.9 million, or 1.2%, compared to the prior year, and up $33.0 million, or 2.8%, compared to the prior quarter. Net interest income growth over the sequential quarter was due to growth in average earning assets, an improved mix of loans and deposits, an increase in consumer and commercial deposits, and a decrease in wholesale funding during the fourth quarter. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2008 was 3.14%, an increase of one basis point and seven basis points over the fourth quarter of 2007 and third quarter of 2008, respectively. A 145 basis point decrease in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared to a 124 basis point decrease in earning asset yields in the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed to the increase in net interest margin, which offset the negative impact of the increase in nonperforming loans in 2008.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $4,737.1 million, down $85.1 million, or 1.8%, compared to 2007. Net interest margin was 3.10% compared to 3.11% in 2007. The decline was driven by the increased level of nonperforming assets, partially offset by a reduction in higher cost funding sources.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $717.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, which was $141.7 million, or 24.6%, above prior year. The fourth quarter included securities gains of $411.1 million related to available for sale securities that were acquired in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with hedging the value of mortgage servicing rights. Volatility in interest rates and increased loan prepayment speed estimates during the quarter resulted in a $370.0 million impairment of mortgage servicing rights that were carried at amortized cost. Servicing related income in the fourth quarter of 2007 included a $19.2 million gain on the sale of servicing rights. Mortgage production income declined $50.1 million in the fourth quarter, as reserves for losses associated with repurchases of mortgage loans increased approximately $32 million and mortgage origination volume declined 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. These elements were partially offset by a decrease in valuation losses on loans carried at fair value or held for sale. While fourth quarter origination income declined versus prior year and prior quarter, mortgage loan applications in the fourth quarter of 2008 were up 16% compared to the third quarter.
The fourth quarter of 2008 included net mark to market valuation losses in trading income of $43.6 million related to illiquid trading securities and loans carried at fair value, and losses of $44.3 million related to the tightening of credit spreads on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value. The fourth quarter of 2007 included losses of approximately $475 million related to market value declines in asset-backed securities, net of valuation gains on the Company's debt carried at fair value. Exposure to securities acquired in the fourth quarter 2007 has been reduced to approximately $250 million as of December 31, 2008, down from $3.5 billion at the end of 2007. Exclusive of core mark to market losses, trading income declined as compared to both the fourth quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008 due to declines in derivatives, structured leasing and merchant banking revenues which were partially offset by growth in credit-related fees, fixed income and trading, and direct finance fees.
Trust and investment management income declined $44.4 million, or 26.0%, from the fourth quarter of 2007, as a result of the sale of certain trust related businesses earlier in 2008 and lower fee income that was attributable to the decline in the equity markets. Investment banking income increased $2.9 million, or 5.3%, over the fourth quarter of 2007. Other fee based revenues in the fourth quarter were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, as the impact of the slowing economy resulted in less transaction-related fees. The fourth quarter of 2008 also included a gain of $19.9 million related to the settlement of legal proceedings, and the Company recognized a net gain of $118.8 million from the sale/leaseback of branch and office properties in the fourth quarter of 2007.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, noninterest income was $4,473.5 million, which was $1,044.8 million, or 30.5%, over 2007. The most significant element of the increase was incremental gains on the sale of available for sale securities of $830.2 million, which were executed in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with hedging the value of mortgage servicing rights, and incremental gains on the sale of The Coca-Cola Company stock ("Coke"). During 2008, the Company recognized
 
approximately $400 million in net market valuation losses related to certain illiquid trading assets, loans carried at fair value, auction rate securities, and other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities, net of valuation gains on the Company's public debt carried at fair value, as compared to approximately $700 million in comparable net losses during 2007. Gains on the Company's public debt carried at fair value in 2008 were $431.7 million as compared to $140.9 million during 2007. During 2008, the Company recorded gains on the following transactions:
 
Further, the Company recognized a net gain of $37.0 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $118.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the sale/leaseback of branch and office properties. During 2008, SunTrust experienced approximately 10% growth in fee based categories such as service charges on deposit accounts, up $82.1 million, investment banking income, up $21.6 million, and credit card fees, up $27.7 million. Trust and investment management fees declined $92.7 million for the same reasons as indicated above. Mortgage servicing income decreased $407.3 million due to the $370.0 million impairment charge and higher gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights in 2007. For 2008, mortgage production volume declined 37.6% to $36.4 billion compared to 2007; however, mortgage production-related income increased $80.4 million, or 88.4%, due to relatively lower valuation losses, particularly due to the elimination of Alt-A loans from the warehouse, increased margins, and the adoption of certain accounting standards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Noninterest Expense
For the fourth quarter of 2008, noninterest expense was $1,588.6 million, an increase of $133.3 million, or 9.2%, over the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily driven by a $334.3 million increase in credit-related expenses to $415.7 million in the quarter, which overshadowed the success achieved in reducing expenses through the Company's E
2
efficiency and productivity program. Credit-related expenses include operating losses of $236.1 million, which includes increased reserves for borrower misrepresentations on mortgage loan documentation and insurance claim denials of $166.9 million, other real estate losses of $35.3 million, credit and collection costs of $44.3 million, and mortgage reinsurance reserves of $100.0 million. The fourth quarter also included a $14.3 million expense reversal related to Visa litigation, resulting from the recognition of the funding by Visa of its litigation escrow account, compared to a $76.9 million expense accrual for Visa litigation in the fourth quarter of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008, SunTrust recorded write-downs of $15.7 million related to Affordable Housing properties as compared to $57.7 million of related charges in the fourth quarter of 2007. Outside processing increased $38.5 million, or 36.5%, due to the outsourcing of certain back-office operations in the third quarter of 2008, which was more than offset by the corresponding decrease in employee compensation and benefits. Essentially all other categories of expense decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, total noninterest expense was $5,890.4 million, an increase of $656.6 million, or 12.5%, over 2007. The items previously discussed were the primary drivers of the increase, particularly the credit-related costs, and the third quarter expense associated with the contribution of Coke stock to our charitable foundation recognized in marketing and customer development expense.
Provision for Income Taxes
For the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $309.0 million compared to a tax benefit of $79.7 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, income taxes were a benefit of $67.3 million compared to a provision of $615.5 million in 2007. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2008, was due to the charitable contribution of the Coke stock, and other significant differences between generally accepted accounting principles and taxable income primarily related to non-taxable interest and dividends, state taxes, and federal tax credits.
 
Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 2008, SunTrust had total assets of $189.3 billion and shareholders' equity was $22.4 billion, representing 11.83% of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were $48.42 and $28.36 as of December 31, 2008, respectively.
Loans
Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $127.6 billion, which was up 5.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and up $2.0 billion, or 6.3% on a sequential quarter annualized basis. The increase in average loans was concentrated in commercial loans. Average construction loans in the fourth quarter declined $4.3 billion, or 32.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2007, in conjunction with the Company's efforts to reduce its exposure to construction loans, as well as transfers to nonaccrual status. Average loans held for sale for the quarter declined $4.8 billion, or 54.8%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 as mortgage production levels declined.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits totaled $102.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $2.6 billion, or 2.6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, and $2.0 billion, or 8.1% on a sequential quarter annualized basis. The 2008 fourth quarter increase in customer deposits was driven by growth in money market and time deposits, partially offset by declines in NOW and savings accounts, while demand deposit balances were relatively flat. Average balances for brokered deposits declined $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2008, as lower cost deposits and short-term funding sources were utilized.
Capital
The estimated Tier 1 capital, total average shareholders' equity to total average assets, and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios at December 31, 2008, were 10.85%, 11.17%, and 8.39%, respectively, compared to 8.15%, 10.34%, and 6.40%, respectively, as of September 30, 2008. The $4.85 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program qualifies as Tier 1 capital and increased SunTrust's already well capitalized status. Despite the Company's strong capital ratios, SunTrust's Board of Directors has decided to reduce the quarterly dividend from $0.54 to $0.10 per common share outstanding given the strain on earnings from increased credit costs and the challenging revenue environment.Under the terms of the agreement entered into with the U.S. Treasury, the Company has the latitude to return the dividend to its previous level of $0.54 per quarter.
Asset Quality
Nonaccrual loans, as of December 31, 2008, totaled $3,940.0 million compared to $3,289.5 million as of September 30, 2008 and $1,430.4 million as of December 31, 2007. Residential mortgage and construction loans were 47% and 32%, respectively, of total nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2008. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $552.5 million compared to $168.0 million for the fourth quarter in 2007. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 was 1.72% compared to 1.24% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and 0.55% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily related to consumer and residential real estate loans, as well as commercial related loans. Other real estate owned increased to $500.5 million, up 29.3% over September 30, 2008, as the Company foreclosed on the collateral securing nonperforming loans.
For the fourth quarter, the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge-offs by $410.0 million as the overall impact of the housing market and increased delinquencies impacted the allowance for loan losses, which totaled $2,351.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and was 1.86% of total loans. The allowance for loan losses was 1.05% of total loans as of December 31, 2007.
 
LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The following discussion details results for SunTrust's four business lines: Retail and Commercial, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage, and Wealth and Investment Management. At the end of 2008, the Company announced certain management and organizational changes related to the lines of business. The Company's reporting segments could change after the organizational transitions are completed in 2009. All revenue is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the lines of business, results include net interest income which is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing. Further, provision for loan losses is represented by net charge-offs.
SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other and Treasury, which includes the Treasury department as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. This segment also includes differences created between internal management accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles, certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges, differences in provision expense compared to net charge-offs, as well as equity and its related impact.
Retail and Commercial Banking
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $18.5 million, a decrease of $154.1 million, or 89.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision for loan losses due to home equity line, consumer, indirect, and commercial loan net charge-offs, lower deposit related net interest income and higher credit and fraud related noninterest expense, partially offset by growth in loan net interest income.
Net interest income decreased $16.9 million, or 2.5%, driven by a shift in deposit mix and compressed spreads due to increased competition for deposits. Average deposits increased $2.0 billion, or 2.5%, while deposit spreads decreased 12 basis points resulting in a $25.5 million decrease in net interest income. Low cost demand deposit and savings accounts decreased a combined $0.7 billion, or 4.0%, primarily driven by a decrease in savings. Higher cost products such as NOW and money market increased a combined $2.1 billion, or 5.9%. Certificates of deposit and IRA accounts increased $0.6 billion, or 2.2%. Net interest income from loans increased $10.3 million as average loan balances increased $1.0 billion, or 2.0%. Growth in commercial loans, equity lines, credit card, student loans, and loans acquired in conjunction with the GB&T transaction was partially offset by an approximately $0.9 billion decline in average loan balances related to the migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to Wholesale Banking.
Provision for loan losses increased $184.1 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity lines reflecting deterioration in the residential real estate market, while provision for loan losses on consumer, indirect, and commercial loans, primarily to commercial clients with annual revenues of less then $5 million, also increased.
Total noninterest income increased $1.1 million, or 0.3%, from the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $2.2 million increase in interchange fees and a $2.8 million increase in ATM fees. Service charges on deposits declined by $2.7 million driven by higher uncollectible NSF fees and changes to the fee structure designed to encourage growth in checking accounts and balances.
Total noninterest expense increased $44.3 million, or 6.9%, from the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase was driven primarily by higher credit-related expenses including operating losses due to fraud, other real estate, and collections, as well as continued investment in the branch distribution network.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Retail and Commercial Banking net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $306.6 million, a decrease of $483.9 million, or 61.2%, compared to the same period in 2007. This decrease was primarily the result of higher provision for loan losses due to home equity line, consumer,
 
indirect, and commercial loan net charge-offs, lower net interest income related to deposit spreads and higher credit-related noninterest expense, partially offset by strong growth in service charges on deposits.
Net interest income decreased $217.9 million, or 7.7%, driven by a continued shift in deposit mix and decreased spreads, as deposit competition and the interest rate environment encouraged customers to migrate into higher yielding interest-bearing deposits. Average deposit balances increased $0.8 billion, or 1.0%, while deposit spreads decreased 26 basis points resulting in a $207.6 million decrease in net interest income. Low cost demand deposit and savings account average balances decreased a combined $1.6 billion, or 8.1%, primarily due to decreases in commercial demand and savings. Higher cost products such as NOW and money market increased a combined $2.3 billion, or 6.7%. Net interest income from loans decreased $14.3 million, or 1.4%, as average loan balances declined $0.1 billion, or 0.1%. Growth in commercial loans, equity lines, credit card, student loans, and loans acquired in conjunction with the GB&T transaction was offset by an approximately $1.8 billion decline in average loan balances related to the migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to Wholesale Banking.
Provision for loan losses increased $593.1 million over the same period in 2007. The provision increase was most pronounced in home equity lines reflecting deterioration in the residential real estate market, while provision for loan losses on consumer, indirect, and commercial loans, primarily to commercial clients with annual revenues of less then $5 million, also increased.
Total noninterest income increased $102.6 million, or 8.2%, over the same period in 2007. This increase was driven primarily by a $66.5 million, or 9.1%, increase in service charges on both consumer and business deposit accounts, primarily due to growth in the number of accounts, higher NSF rates, and an increase in occurrences of NSF fees. Interchange fees increased $24.5 million, or 12.1%, and ATM revenue increased $9.9 million, or 8.3%.
Total noninterest expense increased $60.2 million, or 2.4%, from the same period in 2007. The continuing positive impact of expense savings initiatives and lower amortization of intangibles was offset by higher credit-related expenses including operating losses due to fraud, other real estate, and collections, as well as continued investments in the branch distribution network.
Wholesale Banking
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking's net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $12.3 million, compared to a loss of $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of $54.3 million. Lower market valuation trading losses, lower Affordable Housing related noninterest expenses and higher net interest income were partially offset by higher provision for loan losses.
Net interest income was $161.0 million, up $18.8 million, or 13.2%, from the prior year primarily driven by strong loan growth. Average loan balances increased $6.0 billion, or 19.2%, while the corresponding net interest income increased $6.4 million, or 5.6%. The increase in average loan balances was driven by double digit growth in large corporate, middle market, and leasing but was partially offset by reductions in the residential builder portfolio. The growth in net interest income due to volume was partially offset by overall portfolio spread compression caused by a shift in mix away from higher spread residential construction loans to lower spread commercial loans, as well as higher real estate-related nonaccrual loans. Trading assets net interest income increased $16.8 million, or 102.0%, primarily driven by improved spreads and higher volumes in the fixed income sales and trading business. Total average deposits were up $1.9 billion, or 25.5%, primarily in higher cost deposits. The net interest income on deposits declined $3.3 million, or 9.3%, as the additional volume was more than offset by lower credit for funds on demand deposits.
Provision for loan losses was $111.9 million, an increase of $98.8 million from the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher residential builder-related charge-offs and higher charge-offs from large corporate and middle market clients.
 
Total noninterest income was $132.7 million, an increase of $118.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Lower market valuation trading losses primarily related to structured products, as well as higher revenues from credit-related fees, fixed income sales and trading, and direct finance, were in part offset by lower revenues in derivatives, structured leasing, merchant banking, and Affordable Housing.
Total noninterest expense was $214.4 million, a decrease of $32.1 million, or 13.0%. The migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to Wholesale Banking accounted for an approximately $5.0 million increase in expense. The remainder of Wholesale Banking decreased $37.1 million, or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower Affordable Housing expense, as SunTrust recorded $15.7 million of write-downs in the fourth quarter 2008 as compared to $57.7 million of related charges in the fourth quarter of 2007. Certain structural expenses also decreased partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation and higher other real estate expense.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Wholesale Banking's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $217.3 million, an increase of $21.2 million, or 10.8%, compared to the same period in 2007. Lower market valuation trading losses in structured products and Affordable Housing related noninterest expenses were partially offset by an increase in provision expense, lower merchant banking gains, and higher incentive-based compensation.
Net interest income was $564.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, relatively unchanged from prior year. Average loan balances increased $4.8 billion, or 16.2%, while the corresponding net interest income declined $7.1 million, or 1.6%. The migration of middle market clients from Retail and Commercial to Wholesale Banking accounted for approximately $1.8 billion of the loan balances and $25.8 million of the loan-related net interest income increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking increased $3.0 billion, or 10.4%, driven by increased corporate banking loans and lease financing which was partially offset by reductions in the residential builder portfolio. The corresponding net interest income declined $32.9 million, or 7.3%, due to a shift in mix away from higher spread residential construction loans to lower spread commercial loans, as well as an increase in residential construction nonaccrual loans. Total average deposits increased $3.5 billion, or 63.2%, primarily in higher cost interest-bearing deposits. Deposit-related net interest income decreased $8.9 million, or 6.6%, driven by the lower credit for funds on demand deposits partially offset by the increased volumes in higher cost deposit products.
Provision for loan losses was $167.4 million, an increase of $120.5 million over the prior year, resulting from higher residential builder related charge-offs as well as increased charge-offs on middle market clients partially offset by lower charge-offs in corporate banking.
Noninterest income increased $168.2 million, or 35.0%, primarily due to lower market valuation trading losses in structured products. In addition, increases in direct finance, loan syndications, credit-related fees, and fixed income sales and trading were partially offset by a reduction in merchant banking gains and lower revenues in structured leasing, derivatives, and Affordable Housing.
Noninterest expense increased $6.4 million, or 0.8%, primarily due to the transfer of the middle market business from Retail and Commercial to Wholesale Banking which accounted for approximately $24.9 million of the increase. The remainder of Wholesale Banking's noninterest expense decreased $18.4 million, or 2.3%, primarily due to a decrease in write-downs related to Affordable Housing properties offset in part by higher incentive-based compensation.
Mortgage
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage had a net loss of $285.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to a net loss of $30.4 million in fourth quarter 2007, a decrease of $255.2 million, principally due to higher credit-related costs.
Net interest income declined $34.3 million, or 26.6%. Average loans were down $0.8 billion, or 2.4%, while net interest income was down $30.9 million, or 34.6%. Nonaccrual loans accounted for $13.5 million of the net interest income decline as average nonaccruals increased $1.2 billion. Accruing loans
 
declined $1.9 billion, or 6.2%, while net interest income decreased $17.4 million, or 18.2%. The decline in net interest income was influenced by compressed spreads due to a change in product mix as declines in construction-perm and Alt-A balances were replaced with lower yielding prime first lien mortgages.
Provision for loan losses increased $94.0 million to $140.2 million due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income declined $33.7 million, or 33.5%. The decline was principally due to lower origination income and higher loan repurchase reserves, partially offset by securities gains in excess of mortgage servicing rights impairment. Mortgage production income declined $55.7 million, with loan repurchase reserves increasing $32.5 million, while income related to lower loan production drove the remainder of the decrease. Loan production of $7.2 billion was down $5.7 billion, or 44.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Mortgage servicing income was down $393.5 million, driven by $370.0 million of impairment of mortgage servicing rights that were carried at amortized cost. Also, mortgage servicing income in the fourth quarter of 2007 included $19.2 million of gains from the sale of servicing rights, as compared to no sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. The mortgage servicing rights impairment expense was offset by $410.7 million of gains from the sale of available for sale securities that were acquired in conjunction with the Company's risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of mortgage servicing rights. Total loans serviced at December 31, 2008 were $162.0 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion, or 8.1%.
Total noninterest expense was up $254.6 million, or 106.7%, principally due to higher credit-related costs. Operating losses increased $165.1 million driven by fraud losses and reserves primarily related to borrower misrepresentation and insurance claim denials. Reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $99.9 million and other real estate and collection services costs increased $25.1 million. Staff and commissions expense were down $23.8 million, or 22.5%, primarily due to lower loan production.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Mortgage reported a net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 of $561.8 million, compared to $5.4 million in net income in 2007, a decrease of $567.2 million, principally due to higher credit-related costs.
Net interest income declined $67.0 million, or 12.8%. Average loans increased $0.5 billion, or 1.7%, while the resulting net interest income declined $78.7 million. Nonaccrual loans accounted for $46.0 million of the net interest income decline as average nonaccrual loans increased $1.1 billion. Accruing loans declined $0.5 billion, or 1.8%, while net interest income decreased $32.7 million, or 8.5%. The decline in net interest income was influenced by a change in product mix as declines in construction-perm and Alt-A balances were replaced with lower yielding prime first lien mortgages. Average mortgage loans held for sale declined $5.5 billion; however, due to widening spreads, net interest income increased $25.4 million. Average investment securities were up $0.8 billion while net interest income increased $21.5 million primarily due to improved spreads. Total deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 4.8%, although net interest income on deposits and other liabilities decreased $17.7 million primarily due to lower short-term interest rates.
Provision for loan losses increased $410.1 million to $491.3 million due to higher residential mortgage and residential construction net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $70.2 million, or 19.2%, due to reduced net valuation losses, increased production fee income, and securities gains in excess of mortgage servicing rights impairment, partially offset by higher repurchase reserves and lower gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights. Total production income increased $83.2 million, or 85.5%, driven by reduced valuation losses associated with secondary market loans and the recognition of loan origination fees resulting from the Company's election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007. The increase in loan production income was partially offset by increased reserves for the repurchase of loans. Loan production of $36.4 billion was down $21.9 billion, or 37.6%. Mortgage servicing income declined $426.3 million from $193.6 million in 2007, to a net loss of $232.7 million in 2008. The decline was driven by $370.0 million in impairment of mortgage servicing rights that were carried at amortized cost, as well as lower gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights. The mortgage servicing rights impairment was
 
offset by $410.7 million of gains from the sale of available for sale securities that were acquired in conjunction with the Company's risk management strategies associated with economically hedging the value of mortgage servicing rights.
Total noninterest expense increased $509.1 million, or 61.8%, driven by increased credit-related expenses. Operating losses were up $266.9 million driven by fraud losses and reserves primarily related to borrower misrepresentation and insurance claim denials. Reserves for mortgage reinsurance losses increased $179.8 million while other real estate expense and collection services expense increased $95.9 million. Additionally, the recognition of loan origination costs resulting from the Company's election to record certain mortgage loans at fair value beginning in May 2007 increased noninterest expense compared with the prior year, offsetting significant reductions in staff and commissions expense related to lower loan production.
Wealth and Investment Management
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $34.0 million, an increase of $129.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $250.5 million market valuation loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to securities purchased from the Company's RidgeWorth subsidiary.
Net interest income decreased $3.0 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to lower average deposits. Average deposits were down $0.8 billion, or 7.8%, while net interest income on deposits declined $1.6 million, or 2.9%, due to the lower average balance, as well as a lower credit for funds on demand deposits. Average loans increased $0.3 billion, or 4.3%, driven by a $179.2 million increase in commercial loans primarily in the professional specialty lending units.
Provision for loan losses increased $7.5 million primarily due to higher home equity lines, consumer, and mortgage net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $170.7 million primarily due to a $250.5 million market valuation loss in the fourth quarter of 2007 on purchased securities partially offset by lower trust income. Trust income decreased $43.0 million, or 25.4%, primarily due to lower market valuations on managed equity assets and lower revenue as a result of the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust. As of December 31, 2008, assets under management were approximately $113.1 billion compared to $142.8 billion as of December 31, 2007. Assets under management include individually managed assets, the RidgeWorth Funds, managed institutional assets, and participant-directed retirement accounts. SunTrust's total assets under advisement were approximately $192.0 billion, which includes $113.1 billion in assets under management, $45.7 billion in non-managed trust assets, $31.2 billion in retail brokerage assets, and $2.0 billion in non-managed corporate trust assets.
Total noninterest expense decreased $43.2 million, or 17.3%, driven by lower staff and lower structural expense resulting from the sale of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust. Employee compensation declined $17.3 million, or 14.4%, resulting from reduced headcount and lower incentive payments.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Wealth and Investment Management's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $186.9 million, an increase of $98.6 million compared to same period in 2007. The following transactions represented $141.7 million of the year-over-year increase:
 
 
Net interest income decreased $20.3 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to a decline in deposit-related net interest income. Average deposits were down $0.2 billion, or 2.2%, while net interest income on deposits declined $14.4 million, or 6.5%, due to the decreased average balance, as well as a lower credit for funds on demand deposits. Average loans increased $0.1 billion, or 1.8%, while net interest income declined $5.0 million driven by growth in commercial loans in the professional specialty lending units at compressed spreads.
Provision for loan losses increased $18.4 million driven by higher home equity lines, personal credit lines, and consumer mortgage net charge-offs.
Total noninterest income increased $138.6 million, or 17.1%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 driven by a decrease in market valuation losses. Additionally, gains on the sale of non-strategic businesses were offset by the corresponding loss of revenue and lower market valuations on managed equity assets. Trading gains and losses increased $168.4 million primarily due to a $250.5 million market valuation loss in 2007 related to securities purchased from the Company's RidgeWorth subsidiary as compared to a $63.5 million market valuation loss in 2008 related to Lehman bonds purchased from the Company's RidgeWorth subsidiary. A $29.6 million gain on sale of First Mercantile Trust in 2008 and $24.1 million of incremental noninterest income from the sale of the Company's Lighthouse Partners investment also increased income. Retail investment income increased $6.8 million, or 2.5%, due to higher annuity sales and higher recurring managed account fees. Trust income decreased $91.1 million, or 13.4%, primarily due to the aforementioned sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust, which resulted in a $49.1 million decline in trust income as well as lower market valuations on managed equity assets.
Total noninterest expense decreased $52.8 million, or 5.2%, despite a $45.0 million impairment charge on a client based intangible in the second quarter of 2008. Noninterest expense before intangible amortization declined $91.0 million, or 9.2%, driven by lower staff, discretionary, and indirect expenses, as well as lower structural expense resulting from the sales of Lighthouse Partners and First Mercantile Trust.
Corporate Other and Treasury
Three Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $126.8 million, compared to net income of $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease of $133.2 million, primarily due to a $221.3 million increase in provision for loan losses.
Net interest income increased $49.3 million, or 31.9%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to increased gains on interest rate swaps employed as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy. Total average assets decreased $3.6 billion, or 16.8%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio in 2007 as part of the Company's overall balance sheet management strategy. Total average deposits decreased $3.7 billion, or 22.7%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered deposits, as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business was $410.4 million, compared to $189.1 million in 2007, an increase of $221.3 million.
Total noninterest income declined $114.9 million compared to the same period in 2007. The decline is primarily related to $118.8 million gain on the sale/leaseback of real estate properties in 2007.
Total noninterest expense declined $90.3 million. The decrease was mainly due a $14.3 million expense reversal related to Visa litigation, resulting from the recognition of the funding by Visa of the litigation escrow account, compared to a $76.9 million accrual in the same period in 2007.
 
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007
Corporate Other and Treasury's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 was $646.8 million, an increase of $93.1 million, or 16.8%, from the same period in 2007.
Net interest income increased $221.0 million, or 40.5%, over the same period in 2007 mainly due to increased gains on interest rate swaps employed as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy. Total average assets decreased $5.5 billion, or 21.6%, mainly due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio in 2007 as part of the Company's overall balance sheet management strategy. Total average deposits decreased $8.0 billion, or 35.9%, mainly due to a decrease in brokered and foreign deposits as the Company reduced its reliance on wholesale funding sources.
Provision for loan losses, which predominantly represents the difference between consolidated provision for loan losses and net charge-offs for the lines of business, was $909.6 million in 2008, compared to $242.5 million in 2007, an increase of $667.1 million.
Total noninterest income increased $565.1 million compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to increased gains on securities and the sale of non-strategic businesses. Securities gains increased $431.4 million primarily due to the sale of Coke stock, partially offset by market value impairment related to certain asset-backed securities that were estimated to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Trading gains and losses increased $40.2 million as gains on the Company's long-term debt carried at fair value were partially offset by losses on certain illiquid assets. Gains on the Company's public debt carried at fair value in 2008 were $431.7 million as compared to $140.9 million during 2007. The increase was also due to an $86.3 million gain on the Company's holdings of Visa in connection with its initial public offering and an $81.8 million gain on sale of TransPlatinum subsidiary were offset by an $81.8 million decrease in gains on the sale/leaseback of real estate properties.
Total noninterest expense increased $133.6 million from the same period in 2007. The increase in expense was mainly due to a $183.4 million contribution of Coke stock to the Company's charitable foundation recognized in marketing and customer development expense.

Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Exhibit 99.3 to our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on October 23, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov). Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; current levels of market volatility are unprecedented; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation will stabilize the U.S. financial system; the impact on us of recently enacted legislation, in particular the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and its implementing regulations, and actions by the FDIC, cannot be predicted at this time; credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect
 
our business, revenue and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on our common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of residential real estate may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and these require us to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries that could result in current or future gains or losses or the possible consolidation of those entities; and we are subject to market risk associated with our asset management and commercial paper conduit businesses.
