(e) On February 10, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") made annual grants to the Company's senior executives at a regularly-scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. The Company disclosed those grants in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 17, 2009.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Subsequent to such grants, several events occurred which change the information in that report. The Company files this amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A to report the changed information. Except as noted in this amended report, the information in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed February 17, 2009 remains in effect.
In summary, certain named executive officers, in consultation with the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, initiated the following actions believed to be appropriate in light of a meaningful alteration in the overall financial services industry executive compensation environment that evolved subsequent to February 10, 2009:
 
The chart below summarizes these changes and reflects the total grants made to each of Messrs. Wells, Rogers and Chancy in 2009, as revised:
 
 
 
Vesting of performance-vested stock options will be determined based on our total shareholder return (TSR) measured relative to a peer group. We define TSR as stock price gains plus the value of dividends as if reinvested in our stock, measured over a 3-year period. The peer group will consist of the 25 largest (by assets) bank holding companies, with adjustments made to the group as needed, and with performance measured for the calendar years 2009 through 2011. In the table above, we report the number of stock options awarded. However, the number of stock options that will vest, if any, is variable and can range from 0% and 100% of the initial number of stock options. The actual number which will vest depends upon our performance as measured by our TSR after 3 years relative to the peer group. Performance vested stock options and restricted stock are also subject to normal time-vesting requirements.
Vesting of Performance-Vested Stock Options.
 
We will use straight-line interpolation to determine the number of shares to be awarded if our TSR falls between the 25
th
and 50
th
percentiles. Messrs. Wells, Rogers, and Chancy have agreed to a cap of 100% of the initial award amount with no potential for an increased payout based upon superior performance.
Time-vested restricted stock cliff vests after 3 years. Time-vested stock options cliff vest after 3 years and have an exercise price of $9.06. Performance-vested restricted stock will vest as described in our Current Report filed February 17, 2009.
Other Vesting.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
