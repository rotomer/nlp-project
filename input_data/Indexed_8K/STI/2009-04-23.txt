Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
April 23, 2009
 
 
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2009 of $815.2 million compared to net income of $290.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. Net loss per average common diluted share was $2.49 compared to net income per average common diluted share of $0.81 in the first quarter of 2008. The majority of the first quarter loss to common shareholders was attributable to a non-cash, after-tax charge of $714.8 million, or $2.03 per share, related to the impairment of goodwill. The goodwill impairment charge had no impact on the Company's strong regulatory capital and tangible equity ratios. Excluding the impairment charge, the loss in the first quarter was $0.46 per common share compared to a loss of $1.07 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The loss in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to higher recession-related credit costs.
"There are two clear messages that emerge from our first quarter results," said James M. Wells III, SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "First, SunTrust, like other financial institutions, is still working through credit and earnings challenges as the weak economy continues to take a toll on performance. Second, there are some preliminary signs of improvement in several key areas, including mortgage originations, consumer and commercial deposit growth, and early-stage delinquencies." Mr. Wells said the first quarter loss was entirely driven by the goodwill charge and increased reserves for loan losses, while revenue improved due to growth in mortgage originations. "Given that economic challenges remain, SunTrust is sharply focused on maintaining a strong capital position and mitigating near-term recession-related risk. At the same time, we continue to implement initiatives to take advantage of post-cycle growth opportunities. We are enhancing execution, improving service quality, and executing on numerous additional tactics to augment overall client satisfaction. Our record level of deposit growth is good evidence of these efforts and, coupled with our continued focus on core expense management, has positive implications for the future."
Non-Cash Goodwill Impairment Charge
The Company recorded a non-cash, after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $714.8 million to common shareholders due to continued deterioration in real estate-related market conditions and in the macro economic environment, which put downward pressure on the fair value of the Company's mortgage and commercial real estate-related assets. The impairment charge has no impact on the Company's regulatory capital and tangible equity ratios. SunTrust remains committed to the clients, products, and services of the impacted businesses and believes that the long-term growth prospects of these businesses are strong.
Loan Loss Reserves and Credit-Related Expenses
The Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $994.1 million, which exceeded net charge-offs of $610.1 million by $384.0 million and increased the allowance for loan and lease losses to $2,735.0 million, or 2.21% of total loans. Credit-related expenses, exclusive of the provision for loan losses, were $184.9 million in the first quarter, down $230.7 million compared to the fourth quarter. The provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2009 increased $31.6 million compared to the fourth quarter, resulting in a net decline in credit-related expenses of $199.1 million compared to the fourth quarter.
Deposit and Loan Growth
The Company generated strong deposit growth in the first quarter, with average consumer and commercial deposits increasing $5.3 billion, or 5.2%, and end of period balances increasing $7.2 billion, or 6.8%, compared to the fourth quarter. This record level of growth was driven by clients seeking the security of bank deposits and the successful "Live Solid. Bank Solid." brand advertising that attracted new clients and expanded relationships. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention, which it also believes is contributing to the significant level of deposit growth.
Average total loans increased $2.1 billion, or 1.7%, over the first quarter of 2008. Growth occurred in both consumer and commercial loan categories, with the most significant growth in commercial loans and the most significant decline in construction loans. Average loans held for sale decreased by $1.5 billion, or 22%, compared to the first quarter of 2008, and increased $1.4 billion or 35% compared to the fourth quarter.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity to tangible asset ratios at March 31, 2009 were 11.00% and 5.82%, an increase of 13 and 23 basis points, respectively, compared to December 31, 2008, primarily due to the decrease in tangible assets related to the December sale of securities. The Company has substantial available liquidity due to inflows of high quality deposits and longer term financing sources, although weak demand remains for loans from higher quality borrowers.
 
First Quarter 2009 Consolidated Highlights:
 
(1)
Current period Tier 1 capital ratio is estimated as of the earnings release date
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue was $2,239.5 million for the first quarter of 2009, which was virtually unchanged from the first quarter of 2008. Growth in mortgage-related income exceeded declines in net interest income and other fee-based revenues. The first quarter of 2008 also included gains from the Company's interest in Visa, the sale/leaseback of bank-owned real estate, and the sale of our remaining interest in Lighthouse Investment Partners, collectively totaling $212.7 million.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,093.0 million in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of 6.4% from the first quarter of 2008 and 9.6% from the sequential quarter. First quarter of 2008 and fourth quarter of 2008 average earning assets were essentially unchanged compared to the current quarter. Consequently, the decline in net interest income was driven primarily by margin compression, as well as one less day compared to the first quarter of 2008 and two fewer days compared to the fourth quarter. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2009 was 2.87%, a 20 basis point decline from the first quarter of 2008 and a 27 basis point decline from the fourth quarter of 2008. Average earning asset yields declined 139 basis points, while average interest-bearing liability costs declined 130 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2008. The total yield on earning assets continues to be adversely affected by the growth in nonperforming loans, as well as lower market interest rates.
 
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1,146.5 million for the first quarter of 2009, up $89.0 million, or 8.4%, from the first quarter of 2008. Increases in mortgage-related income and the recognition of a $25.3 million gain on the extinguishment of long-term debt were partially offset by income recorded in the first quarter of 2008 related to i) the gain on sale of our remaining interest in Lighthouse Investment Partners of $89.4 million, ii) the gain on the sale/leaseback of corporate real estate properties of $37.0 million, and iii) the gain from the Visa initial public offering of $86.3 million.
Mortgage production income was $250.5 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $85.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. The increase was due to a 14.6% increase in production volume over the first quarter of 2008 to $13.4 billion, higher margins on current mortgage production and lower market valuation losses on loans carried at fair market value. Mortgage servicing income increased to $83.4 million, up $54.3 million over the first quarter of 2008. The majority of the increase was an impairment recovery of $31.3 million related to mortgage servicing rights carried at amortized cost. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2009, the Company elected to record at fair value mortgage servicing rights generated in 2008 and 2009 and has actively begun hedging the change in fair value of those servicing rights. During the first quarter, the Company recorded $19.2 million of fair value gains related to mortgage servicing with an offsetting mark to market hedging loss recorded in trading income. At quarter end, SunTrust serviced $166.4 billion in mortgage loans, up $11.0 billion, or 7.1%, from the first quarter of 2008.
During the quarter, the Company recorded $112.6 million in mark to market valuation gains on its public debt and related hedges carried at fair value compared to $240.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. The first quarter of 2008 also included $287.2 million in mark to market losses primarily related to investments in asset-backed securities that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007 and other trading and securitization activities compared to approximately $33.7 million for the first quarter of 2009, as our exposure to these investments has been substantially reduced through sales, maturities, and write downs. Trading income also includes the previously mentioned $19.2 million mark to market hedging loss offsetting the gain in mortgage servicing income. Capital markets-related trading income increased slightly as compared to the first quarter of 2008 and improved significantly versus the fourth quarter due to improved fixed income and equity derivatives performance. Securities gains/losses in the first quarter of 2008 included $64.1 million in market value impairment primarily related to certain asset-backed securities that were classified as available for sale and estimated to be other than temporarily impaired.
The Company elected not to early apply the recently issued FASB Staff Positions ("FSPs") regarding measuring fair value and other than temporary impairment. The Company does not expect these FSPs to have a significant impact on its financial results upon the adoption in the second quarter of 2009.
Growth in other transaction fee-related income in the current economic environment was limited; however, the Company generated a 7.4% increase in investment banking income, on improved bond origination and direct financing revenues, and slight gains in credit card fees over the first quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, trust and investment management income and retail investment services declined 28.0% and 21.6%, respectively, compared to the same quarter of 2008, as declines in the equity markets and reduced brokerage activity adversely impacted revenue.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2009 was $2,177.3 million, up $925.1 million, or 73.9%, from the first quarter of 2008. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge, the growth in noninterest expense was $174.0 million, or 13.9%, driven by increased credit-related and other economically cyclical expenses. Increased credit-related expenses include credit and collection costs up $20.1 million, other real estate expense up $32.2 million, and mortgage insurance reserves up $63.0 million, partially offset by a decline of $7.6 million in operating losses. Economically cyclical pension costs increased $36.8 million and FDIC premiums increased $43.1 million. As a result, these credit and other cyclical cost increases drove 120% of the total increase in expenses excluding goodwill. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company incurred fraud-related losses associated with borrower misrepresentations on mortgage loan documentation, as well as operating losses from denied insurance claims that had been reserved for as of year end. While these operational issues may persist in 2009, the Company has determined that borrower credit-related issues are now the predominant contributor to the losses. Consequently, the provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2009 includes losses with characteristics that were previously classified as fraud-related and would have been reflected in operating losses in prior periods. Realized losses on these loans in future periods will be reflected as charge-offs.
Total personnel expenses in the first quarter of 2009 increased $21.0 million, or 2.9%, from the same period in 2008 due to increased pension expense driven by lower returns on pension assets and a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in salaries attributable to the outsourcing of certain operations in the third quarter of 2008, which was the primary factor contributing to the increase in outside processing. Total personnel declined by approximately 2,500 full-time employees since March 31, 2008. FDIC insurance premiums increased $43.1 million from the first quarter of 2008 as a result of higher deposit balances and premium rates. The FDIC is currently contemplating a special insurance assessment of all financial institutions which, if approved by the FDIC, will likely be recognized in the second quarter. The majority of other expense categories declined as a result of the Company's focus on efficiency and expense management. Included in the first quarter of 2008 was $11.7 million in net costs from the early retirement of debt that was carried at cost and a $39.1 million reversal of a portion of the accrued liability associated with Visa litigation.
Income Taxes
For the first quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $150.8 million as a result of the pre-tax loss, compared to a provision for income taxes of $91.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate of (15.6)% compared to (47.1)% in the fourth quarter, was significantly impacted by a $677.4 million non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company recorded $66.3 million in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2009, SunTrust had total assets of $179.1 billion. Shareholders' equity of $21.6 billion as of March 31, 2009, represented 12.1% of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were $46.03 and $28.15 respectively, as of March 31, 2009.
 
Loans
Average loans for the first quarter of 2009 were $125.3 billion, up $2.1 billion, or 1.7%, from the first quarter of 2008. The increase was due to growth in certain commercial and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by declines in construction and residential mortgage loans. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, average loans declined $2.3 billion, or 1.8%, primarily driven by declines in construction lending, due to lower demand, commercial loans, due to a decline in utilization by commercial clients, and residential mortgages, due to higher prepayments. SunTrust continues to be an active lender and, despite lower client demand, home equity lines of credit, consumer direct, and commercial real estate categories have grown as compared to both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2008. Average loans held for sale increased $1.4 billion, or 34.8%, as mortgage production increased 86.0% to $13.4 billion. Total loan production in the first quarter increased to almost $23 billion, up over 20% from the fourth quarter. Strong mortgage originations drove the growth with weak loan demand from commercial clients for working capital and real estate needs partially offsetting the mortgage growth.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter of 2009 were $107.5 billion, up 6.3%, from the first quarter of 2008, and 5.2% versus last quarter, displaying accelerated growth in the first quarter. End of period balances increased to $112.4 billion, up $7.2 billion, or 6.8%, compared to the fourth quarter. Growth is occurring in all products with the exception of savings. Deposit growth is the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing, and client's increased preference for the security of insured deposit products. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention, which the Company also believes is contributing to the record level of deposit growth. During the first quarter, growth was led by noninterest-bearing deposits, which increased $1.9 billion, or 8.9%. Strong growth also occurred in money market and NOW accounts. Due to the increased deposit-related liquidity, the Company reduced average total brokered and foreign deposits by 52.1% from the first quarter of 2008.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 capital and tangible common equity to tangible asset ratios at March 31, 2009, were 11.00% and 5.82%, an increase of 13 and 23 basis points, respectively, compared to December 31, 2008, due to the anticipated decrease in tangible assets. The Company has substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits and longer term financing sources have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities. Weak demand remains for loans from higher quality borrowers. Further, the Company has chosen not to deploy excess liquidity in higher risk business activities or securities.
Asset Quality
The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $2,735.0 million as of March 31, 2009, an increase of $384.0 million from December 31, 2008. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily attributable to higher expected losses in corporate banking, commercial real estate, and home equity loans. In addition, beginning in 2009, the Company began recording estimated incurred losses that were previously related to fraud and denied insurance claims in the allowance for loan losses, as borrower nonperformance due to the deteriorating economic environment became the predominant cause for the expected loss. The allowance was increased by $173.0 million in the first quarter reflecting this change. The allowance for loan and lease losses as of March 31, 2009, represented 2.21% of period-end total loans compared to 1.86% as of December 31, 2008, and 1.25% as of March 31, 2008.
 
Annualized net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2009 were 1.97% of average loans, up from 0.97% in the first quarter of 2008 and 1.72% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs were $610.1 million in the first quarter of 2009, as compared to $297.2 million in the first quarter of 2008 and $552.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The provision for loan losses was $994.1 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $962.5 million and $560.0 million in the fourth and first quarters of 2008, respectively.
Nonperforming loans were $4,641.0 million, or 3.75% of total loans as of March 31, 2009, compared to $3,940.0 million, or 3.10% of total loans as of December 31, 2008, and $2,038.0 million, or 1.65% of total loans as of March 31, 2008. Overall, early stage delinquency trends moderated in the first quarter, declining 5 basis points to 1.76% after increasing 29 basis points during the fourth quarter. Credit metrics within the portfolios were mixed. Residential real estate-related portfolio charge-off rates increased in the first quarter, while early stage delinquencies moderated somewhat in the consumer home equity and residential mortgage portfolios. The consumer direct and indirect portfolios experienced a decline in charge-offs, while early stage delinquencies were roughly stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Commercial charge-offs increased in the quarter driven by relatively fewer, but larger credits in unrelated, economically sensitive industries, while portfolio delinquency rates remained stable. Commercial real estate charge-offs decreased, as the fourth quarter 2008 level was primarily attributable to one commercial purpose credit secured by real estate.
Line of Business Results
The Company has included line of business financial tables as part of this release on their Web site at www.suntrust.com in the Investor Relations section located under "About SunTrust." All revenue in the line of business tables is reported on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. For the lines of business, results include net interest income, which is computed using matched-maturity funds transfer pricing. Further, provision for loan losses is represented by net charge-offs. SunTrust also reports results for Corporate Other and Treasury, which includes the Treasury department as well as the residual expense associated with operational and support expense allocations. This segment also includes differences created between internal management accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles, certain matched-maturity funds transfer pricing credits and charges, differences in provision expense compared to net charge-offs, as well as equity and its related impact. A detailed discussion of the line of business results will be included in the Company's forthcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
The Company has four lines of business used to measure business activities: Retail and Commercial, Corporate and Investment Banking, Household Lending, and Wealth and Investment Management with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. The lines of business recently changed and the prior period has been restated for consistency. The management of Consumer Lending was combined with Mortgage to create Household Lending. Consumer Lending, which includes student lending, indirect auto, and other specialty consumer lending units, was previously a part of Retail and Commercial. This change will enable the Company to provide a strategic framework for all consumer lending products and will also create operational efficiencies. Also, Commercial Real Estate has been moved from Wholesale to Retail and Commercial as the management structure and client needs are similar. Previously, Commercial Real Estate had been combined with Corporate and Investment Banking in Wholesale Banking.

Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; current levels of market volatility are unprecedented; the soundness of
 
other financial institutions could adversely affect us; there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation, or any proposed federal programs, will stabilize the U.S. financial system, and such legislation and programs may adversely affect us; the impact on us of recently enacted legislation, in particular the EESA and its implementing regulations, and actions by the FDIC, cannot be predicted at this time; credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market may adversely affect our reinsurance subsidiary; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect our business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on our common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of residential real estate, increases in unemployment, and the related effects on local economics may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and these require us to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries; and we are subject to market risk associated with our asset management and commercial paper conduit businesses.

"NM" - Not meaningful. Those changes over 100 percent were not considered to be meaningful.

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of calculating this ratio to include, within the period-end loan amount, only loans measured at amortized cost. Previously, period-end loans included loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market. The Company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost. Loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market that have been excluded from the prior period calculation were $450,662 which did not change the calculation by more than one basis point as of March 31, 2008.

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of calculating this ratio to include, within the nonperforming loan amount, only loans measured at amortized cost. Previously, this calculation included nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market. The Company believes this is an improved method of calculation due to the fact that the allowance for loan losses relates solely to the loans measured at amortized cost. Nonperforming loans measured at fair value or the lower of cost or market that have been excluded from the prior period calculation were $173,752 which increased the calculation approximately 7 basis points as of March 31, 2008.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its definition of nonperforming to exclude loans that have been restructured and remain on accruing status. These loans are not considered to be nonperforming because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. This change better aligns the Company's definition of nonperforming loans with the one used by peer institutions and therefore improves comparability of this measure across the industry.

SunTrust presents noninterest expense, net income/(loss), net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, and net income/(loss) per average common diluted share that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charges provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance.
