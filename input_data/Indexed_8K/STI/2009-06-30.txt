All notices of redemption shall state:
(i) the Redemption Date;
(ii) the Redemption Price or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, an estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated);
(iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the Preferred Securities affected (if applicable);
(iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed;

provided
(c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has the Redemption Price then on hand and available for the payment of such Redemption Price, including, in the case of a cash redemption, funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price and, in the case of a Redemption using Debentures, funds on hand and available to redeem or repay such Debentures.
(d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Preferred Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Preferred Securities, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Preferred Securities, to the extent available therefor, the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Preferred Securities. With respect to Preferred Securities that are not Book-Entry Preferred Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Preferred Securities upon surrender of their Preferred Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and the Redemption Price deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Sponsor pursuant
 
to the Guarantee Agreement, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
(e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated to the Common Securities and the Preferred Securities based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called for redemption by any method the Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, that so long as the Preferred Securities are in book-entry-only form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Preferred Securities. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Preferred Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Declaration of Trust, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred Securities shall relate, in the case of any Preferred Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities that has been or is to be redeemed.

The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Declaration of Trust. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. Subject to the provisions of Section 4.8, the Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
(b) For so long as any Preferred Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Property Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Sponsor, the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, in the case of notice by the Holders of the Trust Securities, or to the Sponsor, the Debenture Trustee and the Holders of the Trust Securities, in the case of notice by the Property Trustee.
At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as provided in the Indenture, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(i) the Sponsor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest) on all of the Debentures,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest (including any Additional Interest) thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and
(C) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
 
(ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture.
The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Preferred Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Preferred Securities a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Preferred Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).
provided
(c) For so long as any Preferred Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Declaration of Trust and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1) of the Indenture, any Holder of Preferred Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Sponsor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holder (a "").

Direct Action
(d) Except as otherwise provided in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.13, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Preferred Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
 
purpose of this Declaration of Trust, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

(b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the other Issuer Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or execute any trust or power conferred on the Property Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, , , that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each Holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Preferred Securities. The Issuer Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Preferred Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Preferred Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Issuer Trustees shall, at the expense of the Sponsor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as other than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements or to be classified as an association or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
provided
however

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Declaration of Trust, no amendment to this Declaration of Trust may be made
 
if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be classified as other than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements or to be classified as an association or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.

If any dispute shall arise among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.

Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration of Trust relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. Nothing in this Declaration of Trust shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee from liability for his or her own negligent action, his or her own negligent failure to act, or his or her own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Issuer Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Issuer Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Issuer Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration of Trust. The provisions of this Declaration of Trust, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Issuer Trustees.

If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.14), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration of Trust, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

(i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred:
(A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Declaration of Trust (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Declaration of Trust (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and

(ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an Authorized Officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

(iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Declaration of Trust and the Trust Indenture Act;
(v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Sponsor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law;
(vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees, the Sponsor or any other Person with their respective duties under this Declaration of Trust, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, or the Sponsor or any other Person; and
(vii) subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Declaration of Trust shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.

If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Sponsor, in the case of the Property Trustee, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Administrative Trustees, or any of them, may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of Common Securities delivered to the Relevant Trustee.
 
The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (c) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) at any time if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Unless and until a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of the Common Securities.
If a resigning Property Trustee or Delaware Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Common Securities by Act of such Holders delivered to the Relevant Trustee or, if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of the Preferred Securities, by Act of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, may appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Issuer Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of the Common Securities or Preferred Securities, as the case may be, and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of such Holder and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee.
The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Sponsor and to the Administrative Trustees. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Declaration of Trust, if any Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of the Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the Property Trustee following the procedures regarding expenses and charges set forth above (with the successor being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for the Delaware Trustee set forth in Section 8.7).
