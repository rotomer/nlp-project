Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
July 22, 2009
 
 
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported a net loss available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2009 of $164.4 million, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $530.0 million in the second quarter of 2008. Net loss per average common share was $0.41 compared to net income per average common diluted share of $1.52 in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in earnings compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to increased credit costs in 2009 and the gain on the sale of shares of The Coca-Cola Company ("Coke") stock in the second quarter of 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, the core business generated solid fee income, expanded net interest margin, substantially grew low cost deposits, and continued strong expense management.
"Clearly, recession-related costs continue to impact our results," said James M. Wells III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust. "Yet, when you step back and look at the second quarter, three points stand out beyond the near-term financial impact of recession-driven pressures. First, with enhanced capital, improved liquidity, and bolstered reserves, we have the resources necessary to continue to manage successfully through sustained economic weakness. Second, positive trends in several areas, notably solid deposit growth, increasing net interest margin, strong expense management, and lower early-stage delinquencies, are encouraging. Lastly, our balance of client-focused execution, risk mitigation, and the long-term economic prospects of our markets positions us well to deliver steadily improving returns as we come out of this cycle."
Completion of Capital Raise
During the second quarter, the Company successfully completed its capital plan and initiatives, generating $2.3 billion of capital and exceeding the target of $2.2 billion established by the Federal Reserve under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program ("SCAP"). The Company's capital raising transactions increased Tier 1 common equity by $2.1 billion. The transactions utilized to raise the capital were (i) the issuance of common stock, (ii) the purchase of certain preferred stock and hybrid debt securities, and (iii) the sale of Visa Class B shares. The following is a brief description of each transaction:
 
Regulatory capital was further enhanced and remains well in excess of the capital standards for a well capitalized institution. Estimated Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009 were 7.35% and 12.25%, up 152 basis points and 123 basis points, respectively, from the prior quarter.
Loan Loss Provision
In the second quarter, the Company recorded $962.2 million in provision for loan losses, which exceeded net charge-offs of $801.2 million by $161.0 million compared to a provision for loan losses of $448.0 million during the second quarter of 2008. Provision for loan losses declined by $31.9 million during the current quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Charge-offs increased $191.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2009 driven in large part by an anticipated $99.2 million increase in borrower misrepresentation charges now classified as charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses increased to $2.9 billion, or 2.37% of outstanding total loans, as of June 30, 2009.
Deposit Growth
Average total consumer and commercial deposits increased $6.0 billion, or 5.6%, over the first quarter of 2009 and $11.8 billion, or 11.6%, over the second quarter of 2008, further strengthening the Company's already strong liquidity position. The linked quarter growth was in all deposit categories, with the low cost deposit categories of demand deposits, NOW, and money market accounts increasing the most. The growth was driven by continued marketing campaigns, competitive pricing, and clients' increased preference for the security of insured deposit products. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention, which the Company also believes is contributing to the record level of deposits. Period-end consumer and commercial deposits were $113.7 billion, up 1.2% compared to March 31, 2009, indicating lower deposit growth toward the end of the quarter.
 
Second Quarter 2009 Consolidated Highlights
 
(1)
Current period Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity ratios are estimated as of the earnings release date.
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $2,192.8 million for the second quarter of 2009, a decrease of 15.6% compared to the second quarter of 2008. The decline was driven by the $548.8 million in securities gains from the sale of Coke stock and the $29.6 million gain on sale of a retirement services subsidiary, both recognized in 2008. The second quarter of 2009 included higher mortgage-related and capital markets-related income, the gain on the sale of Visa shares, and the recovery of impairment on the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market, partially offset by lower net interest income.
For the six months, fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $4,407.0 million, down 8.6% from prior year. The decline was driven by significantly higher gains on securities and asset sales in 2008, and lower net interest income, investment management, and transaction based fees in 2009. Partially offsetting these items were lower market valuation losses on previously acquired illiquid securities in 2009, higher market valuation gains on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value in 2008, and higher mortgage-related and capital markets-related income.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,121.1 million in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of 2.6% from the first quarter of 2009 and a 5.4% decline compared to the same quarter last year. Net interest margin increased 7 basis points during the second quarter and declined 19 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2008. Net interest margin benefited from a partial normalization of the relationship between asset and liability yields as compared to the first quarter of 2009. Rates earned on average earning assets declined 10 basis points while rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 17 basis points during the current quarter. Net interest income compared to the second quarter of 2008 declined, as earning asset yields, which declined 100 basis points, were more susceptible to market rate declines than rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities which declined 87 basis points. Average earning assets in the second quarter of 2009 did not change significantly compared to the first quarter of 2009 or the same quarter last year; however, net interest income benefited from the reduction in interest-bearing
 
liabilities and the change in mix towards lower cost sources of funding. Net interest income and margin continue to be adversely affected by increased nonperforming loans.
For the six months, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $2,214.0 million, a decline of 5.9% from the prior year. Net interest margin declined 20 basis points. The same factors in the quarterly year over year comparison contributed to the six month decline in net interest income and margin.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1,071.7 million for the second quarter of 2009, down 24.2% from the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was due to the $548.8 million gain from the sale of Coke stock, a $29.6 million gain from the sale of a retirement services subsidiary, both recognized in the second quarter of 2008, and partially offset by the $112.1 million gain from the sale of Visa shares in the second quarter of 2009. Market valuation losses on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value were relatively stable at $96.2 million in the second quarter of 2009 and $102.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. These losses were related to the improvement in the credit spread on the Company's public debt.
Mortgage production income was $165.4 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $63.5 million in the second quarter of 2008 driven by an almost 80% increase in loan production volume. Mortgage production income was adversely affected by a $49.0 million increase in reserves related to the probable repurchase of mortgage loans that were sold in prior quarters under specified terms that could result in recourse back to the Company. Mortgage servicing related income for the quarter was $139.7 million, an increase of $107.1 million over the second quarter of 2008. The second quarter of 2009 included a $156.9 million recovery of impairment on the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market partially offset by mark to market losses of $39.6 million on servicing rights carried at fair value, net of hedges. Securities losses of approximately $20 million recorded during the quarter related to repositioning the available for sale securities that economically hedge the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. As of June 30, 2009, SunTrust serviced $173.1 billion in mortgage loans, up 9.0% from a year ago.
Trading account profits and commissions increased $19.3 million in the second quarter over the second quarter of 2008 due to higher derivatives activities and fixed income sales and trading. As previously noted, the market valuation loss recorded on the public debt and related hedges carried at fair value was $6.4 million higher in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the current quarter. Investment banking income increased 26.3% due to increased capital markets activities; however, trust and investment management income, retail investment services, and service charges on deposits declined, 25.6%, 24.9% and 8.7%, respectively, due to the adverse impact of economic conditions on financial markets and consumer spending.
For the six months, total noninterest income was $2,192.9 million, down 11.2% compared to the same period of 2008. The decline was largely due to net gains on sale of securities, primarily Coke stock, gains on sale of non-strategic businesses, gains from the sale/leaseback of certain corporate real estate properties, and the gain resulting from the Visa initial public offering, all recorded in 2008, that aggregated to $731.6 million. The 2008 items were only partially offset by the gain on the sale of Visa shares in the current quarter and a $188.2 million recovery of impairment on the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. Additionally, trading account profits and commissions increased $98.4 million due to higher market valuation losses in 2008 related to acquired illiquid assets partially offset by higher gains on the Company's debt and related hedges carried at fair value in the first half of 2008.
 
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the second quarter of 2009 was $1,528.0 million, up 11.1% from the second quarter of 2008, as the cost of FDIC insurance increased $137.8 million, credit-related expenses increased $45.2 million, our proportionate share of potential costs of litigation related to Visa increased $7.0 million, and debt extinguishment charges totaled $38.9 million. The increase in FDIC insurance premiums was primarily due to the $78.2 million special assessment required of all banks recorded in the second quarter of 2009. Credit-related expenses increased primarily due to higher credit and collection services costs and other real estate losses, as the Company aggressively modified and disposed of nonperforming loans. Mortgage reinsurance and operating losses, also included in credit-related expenses, have moderated. The debt extinguishment loss includes a $42.3 million loss from the purchase of hybrid debt securities in connection with the tender offer, a $4.4 million loss related to the extinguishment of $3.5 billion of FHLB advances, and a $7.8 million gain from the retirement of $70 million of debt issued under SunTrust's Global Bank Note program. Included in the net loss from the tender offer was a $164.9 million loss related to the extinguishment of the preferred stock forward sale agreement associated with the purchase of the Purchase Preferred Securities.
Total personnel expense decreased $8.2 million from the second quarter of 2008. Total personnel decreased from 31,602 as of June 30, 2008 to 28,520 as of June 30, 2009, and incentive expense declined due to an alignment of discretionary incentive compensation accruals with business performance. Total personnel expense declined 1.2% despite an increase in pension costs of nearly $30 million due to lower returns on pension assets and a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation. The decline in personnel expense was offset by a 35.6% increase in outside processing as the Company contracted with a third party in the third quarter of 2008 to provide certain check and related processing operations. The second quarter of 2008 also included an impairment charge of $45.0 million related to a specific customer intangible asset.
For the six months, total noninterest expense was $3,680.0 million, an increase of 40.1% over the same period in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the $751.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009 compared to a $45.0 million impairment charge related to a specific customer intangible asset recognized in the second quarter of 2008. Included in the first quarter of 2008 was $11.7 million in net costs from the retirement of debt and a $39.1 million reversal of a portion of the accrued liability associated with the Visa litigation. Credit-related charges increased $152.9 million year over year and FDIC insurance costs, including the special assessment, increased $180.8 million. The 31.1% increase in outside processing was primarily due to the check and related processing services contract beginning in the third quarter of 2008. The majority of the remaining expense categories declined in 2009 as the Company continued its focus on efficiency and expense management.
Income Taxes
For the second quarter and first half of 2009, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $149.0 million and $299.7 million, respectively, as a result of the pre-tax losses, compared to a provision for income taxes of $202.8 million and $294.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2008.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
For the second quarter and year to date periods of 2009, the Company recorded $66.5 million and $132.8 million, respectively, in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
 
Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2009, SunTrust had total assets of $176.7 billion, and shareholders' equity of $23.0 billion, representing 13.0 % of total assets. Book value per common share was $36.16 as of June 30, 2009.
Loans
Average loans for the second quarter of 2009 were $124.1 billion, down 0.9% from the second quarter of 2008 and 1.0% from the first quarter of 2009. Compared to the second quarter of 2008, loans increased in all loan categories, except residential real estate, real estate construction, and consumer indirect as a result of the Company's efforts to reduce its exposure to these categories. During the second quarter of 2009, loans declined in most categories due to weak loan demand as a result of the recessionary environment and borrowers' desire to restrict capital spending and pay down existing debt facilities. The Company remains focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers as businesses and consumers work through the current economic downturn. The decline in the loan portfolio was offset by a similar increase in loans held for sale. Total mortgage loan production was $16.7 billion during the second quarter compared to $13.4 billion during the first quarter of 2009.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the second quarter of 2009 totaled $113.5 billion, up 11.6% from the second quarter of 2008, as growth in NOW, money market accounts, and demand deposits contributed to the overall increase. On a sequential quarter basis, average consumer and commercial deposits increased 5.6% with the majority of the increase in low cost deposits. Deposit growth is the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing, and client's increased preference for the security of insured deposit products. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention, which the Company also believes is contributing to the record level of deposit growth. Period-end consumer and commercial deposits were $113.7 billion, up 1.2% compared to March 31, 2009, indicating lower deposit growth towards the end of the quarter. Average total brokered and foreign deposits declined 56.1% from the second quarter of 2008, as the Company's deposit growth initiatives and longer term financing activities enabled a reduction in these wholesale funding sources.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and total average shareholders' equity to total average assets ratios at June 30, 2009, were 7.35%, 12.25%, and 12.42%, respectively. Tier 1 common equity increased 152 basis points compared to March 31, 2009 primarily due to the capital raised during the quarter in response to the SCAP, as well as lower risk weighted assets from a reduction in unfunded lending commitments. The Company has substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits and longer term financing sources have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $2,896.0 million as of June 30, 2009, up $161.0 million during the quarter and represented 2.37% of period-end total loans, as compared to 2.21% as of March 31, 2009. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was attributable to further deterioration in the housing market and credit quality deterioration due to increasing economic stress in the commercial market. The majority of the increase in the allowance for loan losses related to home equity lines, specific reserves for residential developers, primarily construction, and specific reserves for larger corporate loans.
 
Net charge-offs totaled $801.2 million in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $610.1 million in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of $191.1 million. Contributing to the increase in net charge-offs was $116.2 million in charge-offs related to fraud and denied insurance claims during the current quarter. The first quarter of 2009 included $164.6 million of fraud and denied insurance claims that were written off against the fraud reserve during the first quarter, and therefore were not classified as net charge-offs due to the Company's practice of classifying these losses as operating losses prior to 2009. During the second quarter of 2009, $42.4 million of fraud related losses were recognized against the remaining fraud reserve. Net charge-offs increased in all loan categories, except consumer indirect, with the majority of the increase occurring in residential real estate related loans. The downturn in the economy has impacted the level of commercial loan net charge-offs, which increased $115.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2008. Commercial net charge-offs relate primarily to larger commercial borrowers in economically sensitive industries. Annualized net charge-offs were 2.59% of average loans, up from 1.97% in the first quarter of 2009, and 1.04 % in the second quarter of 2008. While net charge-offs remain elevated and continue to increase, early stage delinquencies have decreased in the prior two quarters relative to their peak at year-end.
Nonperforming loans were $5,504.0 million, or 4.48% of total loans, as of June 30, 2009, compared to $4,641.0 million, or 3.75% of total loans, as of March 31, 2009, and $2,625.3 million, or 2.09% of total loans, as of June 30, 2008. The increase in nonperforming loans was mainly due to an increase in residential mortgage and real estate construction loans, as well as larger commercial borrowers in economically sensitive industries. Accruing restructured loans increased $274.0 million during the quarter to $925.0 million, which demonstrates the proactive steps the Company is taking to responsibly modify loans in order to mitigate loss exposure to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; current levels of market volatility are unprecedented; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; there can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation, or any proposed federal programs, will stabilize the U.S. financial system, and such legislation and programs may adversely affect us; the impact on us of recently enacted legislation, in particular the Emergency
 
Economic Stability Act and its implementing regulations, and actions by the FDIC, cannot be predicted at this time; credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market may adversely affect our reinsurance subsidiary; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect our business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on our common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of residential real estate, increases in unemployment, and the related effects on local economics may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, then operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and these require us to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries; and we are subject to market risk associated with our asset management and commercial paper conduit businesses.

SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. The foregoing numbers primarily reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of common shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net income, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities gains.
1
SunTrust believes that the return on average realized common shareholders' equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders' equity is computed by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders' equity.
2
Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents total revenue -FTE excluding net realized securities (gains)/losses. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities (gains)/losses is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily customer relationship and customer transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
6
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.

SunTrust presents noninterest expense, net income/(loss), net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, and net income/(loss) per average common diluted share that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charges provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance.
