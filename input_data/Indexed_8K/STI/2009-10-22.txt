For Immediate Release
October 22, 2009
 
 
ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported a net loss available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2009 of $377.1 million, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $304.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. Net loss per average common share was $0.76 compared to net income per average common diluted share of $0.87 in the third quarter of 2008. Included in the current quarter was $131.3 million, or $0.16 per common share, of mark-to-market losses on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value.
The decline in earnings compared to the third quarter of 2008 was primarily attributable to the $390.8 million after-tax increase in the provision for loan losses and a $292.8 million after-tax increase in valuation losses associated with the fair value of the Company's public debt. The net loss for the third quarter was $133.5 million higher than the previous quarter, driven primarily by a $106.5 million after-tax increase in provision for loan losses.
"Our third quarter bottom line results reflected the difficult operating environment for more traditional banks," said James M. Wells III, SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Continued recession-related earnings pressures included higher credit costs, softer fee income and generally weak loan demand, as consumers de-leverage and businesses pay down existing credit lines and defer investments." Nevertheless, Mr. Wells added, "we are encouraged by some positive core business trends and the prospect of an improving economy."
Specific to business trends, Mr. Wells noted expanded net interest margin, lower operating expenses and, importantly, stable nonperforming loans and early stage loan delinquency levels. Mr. Wells said that while "tentatively optimistic" about the potential positive impact on SunTrust's businesses and clients from what appears to be an improving economy, he cautioned that "the strength and pace of economic recovery is uncertain and the resultant impact on credit losses, and thus earnings, will likely lag actual economic improvement."
Mr. Wells reiterated that with recent actions to bolster capital, liquidity, and reserves, "SunTrust possesses the resources necessary to successfully manage through sustained economic weakness should it occur." Looking to the balance of 2009 and into 2010, he said "the Company remains focused on risk-mitigation, efficiency and executing client-driven initiatives designed to deliver steadily improving results as the operating environment gets better."
Third Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
(1)
Current period Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common equity ratios are estimated as of the earnings release date.
 
 
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $1,943.2 million for the third quarter of 2009, a decrease of 21.0% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Fully taxable-equivalent total revenue, excluding net securities gains and losses, declined 17.1%. The third quarter of 2008 included an $81.8 million gain on sale of a fuel card and fleet management subsidiary and a $172.8 million valuation reserve related to the expected purchase of auction rate securities ("ARS"). Also impacting the decline in fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was a $341.0 market valuation gain on public debt and related hedges carried at fair value recognized in the third quarter of 2008 compared to a $131.3 million market valuation loss in the current quarter. The remaining decline in fee-related income occurred in cyclically sensitive areas such as trust and investment income and service charge income. Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income declined 0.6% compared to the third quarter of 2008.
For the nine months, fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $6,350.2 million, down 12.8% from prior year. The decline was driven by net gains from the sale and contribution of investment securities, sale of non-strategic businesses, and sale/leaseback of corporate real estate properties coupled with significant market valuation gains on the public debt and related hedges carried at fair value in 2008 compared to market valuation losses related to the public debt and related hedges recognized during 2009. The prior year also included approximately $309 million of market valuation losses on certain illiquid asset-backed securities that were previously acquired from subsidiaries, as well as the market valuation loss related to ARS. Mortgage and capital markets related fee income increased compared to 2008 but was partially offset by declines in trust and investment management income, retail investment services, and service charges. Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income declined 4.1%.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,168.2 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of 4.2% from the second quarter of 2009 and a decline of 0.6% compared to the same quarter last year. Net interest margin increased 16 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively, compared to the sequential quarter and third quarter of 2008. Net interest margin benefited from deposit volumes, mix, and lower rates, as well as repayment of certain long-term debt and hybrid capital instruments that has occurred throughout 2009. On a sequential quarter basis, rates earned on average earning assets declined 4 basis points while rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 23 basis points. Average earning assets declined $3.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, compared to the sequential quarter and prior year quarter due primarily to a decline in loan demand. However, the reduction in interest income from this decline in average earning assets was offset by a reduction in the Company's cost of funds due to a significant increase in consumer and commercial deposits, as well as an improved mix in client deposits, which enabled a significant reduction in higher cost long-term debt and brokered deposits. Net interest income and margin continue to be adversely affected the current level of nonperforming loans.
For the nine months, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $3,382.2 million, a decline of 4.1% from the prior year. Net interest margin declined 12 basis points as the repricing of deposits lagged the decline in yields on earning assets experienced during the first six months of 2009. Year-to-date rates earned on earning assets declined 109 basis points while rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 104 basis points.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $775.1 million for the third quarter of 2009, down 39.7% from the third quarter of 2008. The decline was due to gains generated in 2008 of $183.4 million related to the contribution of The Coca-Cola Company ("Coke") stock to the SunTrust charitable foundation, a $81.8 million gain on the sale of the fuel card and fleet management subsidiary, and valuation gains of $341.0
 
million on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value compared to a loss on such debt of $131.3 million recognized in 2009. The third quarter of 2008 also included mark-to-market losses of $136.9 million on illiquid trading securities and loan warehouses and a valuation reserve of $172.8 million related to the expected purchase of ARS. Investment banking income increased significantly due to higher capital markets activity including strong debt and equity underwriting activity. However, the difficult operating environment was evident in the decline in many other fee-related sources of income. On a sequential quarter basis, noninterest income declined $296.6 million, or 27.7%. The decline was due to the $112.1 million second quarter gain related to the sale from the Visa shares, $156.9 million recovery in the second quarter of previously impaired mortgage servicing rights, and lower mortgage production income in the third quarter due to lower loan production and higher reserves related to the potential repurchase of certain mortgage loans which had previously been sold to third parties. Offsetting these declines were increases during the third quarter in most other fee-related categories, as well as a net increase in securities gains and losses of $71.6 million.
Mortgage production income was $28.1 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2008 and $165.4 million in the second quarter of 2009. Production was up 42% over the third quarter of 2008 but down 31% on a sequential quarter basis. Mortgage production income was adversely affected by $135.6 million in estimated losses related to the potential repurchase of certain mortgage loans that were sold in prior quarters under specified terms that could result in repurchase by the Company compared to $62.0 million recognized last quarter and $12.9 million recorded in the third quarter of 2008, as the volume of claims and anticipated loss severity has increased. Mortgage servicing related income for the current quarter was $60.2 million, down slightly from the third quarter of 2008 and down $79.5 million from the second quarter of 2009 which included a $156.9 million recovery of impairment on the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. The decline was partially offset by lower amortization and less decay in fair value of mortgage servicing rights. As of September 30, 2009, SunTrust serviced $177.6 billion in mortgage loans, up 11.5% from a year ago.
Trading account profits and commissions were down $208.0 million from the third quarter of 2008 as the tightening of credit spreads in 2009 resulted in a mark-to-market valuation loss on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value of $131.3 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to a gain of $341.0 million in 2008. The third quarter of 2008 also included mark-to-market losses of $136.9 million on illiquid trading securities and loan warehouses, as well as the valuation reserve of $172.8 million related to the purchase of ARS. As of September 30, 2009, the Company has completed the purchase of the majority of the ARS it expects to purchase, and most of these securities continue to cash flow, resulting in minimal realized losses. Since the third quarter of 2008, valuation losses on illiquid assets have diminished as liquidity in most of those markets has improved and the Company's holdings have been substantially reduced. Capital markets income, including core trading and investment banking income, increased compared to the third quarter 2008 due to increased trading activity and strong debt and equity underwriting deal flow. Service charges on deposits, trust and investment management income, and retail investment services declined 8.8%, 19.4%, and 29.4%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2008 due to the impact of economic conditions on these fee income items. On a sequential quarter basis, trading account profits and commissions declined primarily due to increased valuation losses from the tightening in spreads on the Company's public debt carried at fair value. Investment banking income and other fee-related income generally remained stable.
For the nine months, total noninterest income was $2,968.0 million, down $787.8 million, or 21.0% compared to the same period of 2008. The decline was largely due to 2008 net gains on sale and contribution of investment securities, primarily Coke stock, gains on sale of non-strategic businesses, and gains from the sale/leaseback of certain corporate real estate properties. The improvement in the Company's credit spreads during 2009 resulted in a charge of $114.9 million compared to a $478.5 million market valuation gain through the third quarter of 2008 recorded in trading account profits and commissions. However, in 2008, trading account profits and commissions included significant market valuation losses on previously acquired illiquid securities, as well as valuation reserves for ARS that did not recur in 2009.
 
Mortgage-related income increased almost 125% due to a 42.8% increase in loan production, increased margins on the sale of loans, a larger servicing portfolio, and a $188.7 million recovery of impairment on the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. Investment banking related income increased compared to 2008 but was partially offset by declines in trust and investment management income, retail investment services, and service charges.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2009 was $1,428.8 million, a decline of 14.2% from the third quarter of 2008, which included the $183.4 million expense related to the contribution of Coke shares to the SunTrust charitable foundation as well as the Company's proportionate share of potential costs of litigation related to Visa of $20.0 million. Current quarter credit-related expenses decreased compared to the third quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower operating losses and mortgage reinsurance expense, partially offset by higher credit and collection services, unfunded commitment reserves, and other real estate losses. On a sequential quarter basis, noninterest expense declined 6.5% due to the FDIC special assessment and debt extinguishment losses recorded in the previous quarter and a decline in personnel expense in the current quarter, partially offset by increased credit-related expenses in the third quarter due to higher other real estate expenses and unfunded commitment reserves. Additionally, the third quarter of 2009 included $31.3 million of impairment related to affordable housing properties.
Total personnel expense decreased $30.2 million, or 4.3%, from the third quarter of 2008 as personnel decreased 4.9% from 29,447 as of September 30, 2008 to 28,015 as of September 30, 2009. Incentive expenses declined in order to align discretionary incentive compensation accruals with business performance; however, pension costs increased nearly $25.8 million due to an increase in the pension obligation as a result of 2009 market valuation assumptions. The decline in personnel expense was offset by a 10.9% increase in outside processing, as the Company contracted with a third party during the third quarter of 2008 to provide certain check and related processing operations. Regulatory assessments increased $26.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2008 due to higher FDIC insurance premiums but were down on a sequential quarter basis due to the special FDIC assessment of $78.2 million levied during second quarter. Broadly, disciplined expense management was evident across controllable operating expenses.
For the nine months, total noninterest expense was $5,108.8 million, an increase of 19.0% over the same period in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the $751.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009 compared to a $45.0 million impairment charge related to a specific customer intangible asset recognized in the second quarter of 2008, partially offset by the $183.4 million charitable contribution expense recorded in the third quarter of 2008. Credit-related charges increased $85.0 million year-over-year despite the exclusion of credit-related losses associated with borrower misrepresentations from operating losses in 2009, as those charges are now considered in the provision for loan losses. FDIC insurance costs, including the special assessment, increased $207.2 million. The 23.5% increase in outside processing was primarily due to the check and related processing services contract beginning in the third quarter of 2008. The majority of the remaining expense categories declined in 2009, as the Company continued its focus on efficiency and expense management.
Income Taxes
For the third quarter of 2009, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $336.1 million compared to a benefit for income taxes of $52.8 million in the third quarter of 2008. The income tax provision in 2009 was impacted by discrete tax benefits recognized in the quarter totaling $47.1 million, primarily related to the settlement of examinations by certain taxing authorities, while the 2008 income tax provision was impacted primarily by the charitable contribution of Coke shares.
 
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
For the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2009, the Company recorded $66.4 million and $199.3 million, respectively, in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of September 30, 2009, SunTrust had total assets of $172.7 billion and shareholders' equity of $22.9 billion, representing 13.3% of total assets. Book value per common share was $36.06 and tangible book value per common share was $23.35 as of September 30, 2009.
Loans
Average loans for the third quarter of 2009 were $119.8 billion, down 4.7% from the third quarter of 2008 and 3.5% from the second quarter of 2009. While the Company remains focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers, residential real estate and real estate construction loans declined as a result of the Company's efforts to reduce its exposure to these categories and the associated risk. Additionally, commercial loans have declined due to weak loan demand as a result of the recessionary environment and borrowers' desire to restrict capital spending and pay down existing debt facilities. Average loans held for sale increased 14.4% over the third quarter of 2008, as total mortgage loan production increased 42% to $11.6 billion in the third quarter of 2009.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter of 2009 totaled $114.5 billion, up 14.3% from the third quarter of 2008, as almost all deposit categories increased and demand deposits grew 17.4%. On a sequential quarter basis, average consumer and commercial deposits increased 0.8% and deposit mix improved due to growth in lower cost deposits and declines in time deposits. Deposit growth is the result of clients' increased preference for the security of insured deposit products, competitive pricing, and effective marketing. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving product offerings and client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention. Average brokered and foreign deposits declined 67.1% from the third quarter of 2008, as the Company's deposit growth and longer term financing activities enabled a reduction in these wholesale funding sources.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and total average shareholders' equity to total average assets ratios at September 30, 2009, were 7.45%, 12.55%, and 13.03%, respectively. The decline in Tier 1 common equity from the current period net loss was offset by a reduction in risk-weighted assets. The Company has substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits and longer term financing sources have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
The allowance for loan and lease losses was $3,024.0 million as of September 30, 2009, up $128.0 million from June 30, 2009, and represented 2.61% of period-end total loans, up 24 basis points from last quarter and up 107 basis points from one year ago. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was attributable to further deterioration in the residential real estate market. While early stage delinquencies remained stable, loss severities related to underlying residential properties continued to increase. The $128.0 million increase in allowance for loan losses compares favorably to the $161.0
 
million, $384.0 million, and $410.0 million increase recognized over the previous three quarters. The provision for loan losses increased $171.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to the increase in net charge-offs, partially offset by the reduced increase in the allowance for loan losses.
Net charge-offs totaled $1,005.9 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $801.2 million in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of $204.7 million with increases concentrated in construction, residential real estate, and commercial. The increase in net charge-offs during the quarter was largely driven by the resolution of loan workouts in the residential builder construction portfolio, residential mortgage charge-offs, and additional charge-offs related to larger corporate borrowers in cyclical industries. Annualized quarterly net charge-offs were 3.33% of average loans, up from 2.59% in the second quarter of 2009 and 1.24% in the third quarter of 2008. Compared to the third quarter of 2008, net charge-offs increased $613.9 million across most loan categories with the largest increase in residential mortgages, $254.3 million; commercial, $146.6 million; and construction, $106.7 million.
Nonperforming loans were $5,444.3 million, or 4.67% of total loans as of September 30, 2009, a decline of $59.6 million compared to June 30, 2009 representing the first quarterly decline since the credit crisis began in 2007 driven primarily by a reduction in nonaccrual commercial loans. The increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans was substantially less than the growth rate observed over the past four quarters. As of September 30, 2008, nonperforming loans totaled $3,289.5 million, or 2.60% of total loans.
Accruing restructured loans increased $418.6 million during the quarter to $1,343.6 million, which demonstrates the proactive steps the Company is taking to responsibly modify loans in order to mitigate loss exposure to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The increase in loan modifications also impacted the moderation in nonperforming loan growth and early stage delinquencies. Early stage delinquencies declined compared to the second quarter of 2009 and the same quarter last year; however, the ratio remained stable at 1.52% as loan balances have declined.
