For Immediate Release
January 22, 2010
 
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported a net loss available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $316.4 million, or $0.64 per average common share, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $374.9 million, or $1.07 per average common share for the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company's results for these periods were adversely impacted by credit-related charges and cyclical expenses that reflected recessionary pressures; however, improvement in both of those areas during the fourth quarter of 2009 equated to a smaller earnings impact as compared to the same quarter last year and the prior quarter.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the net loss available to common shareholders was $1,733.4 million, or $3.98 per average common share, compared to net income of $741.0 million, or $2.12 per average common share in 2008. During the first quarter of 2009, SunTrust recorded a non-cash, after-tax charge of $714.8 million, or $1.64 per share, related to the impairment of goodwill. Excluding the impairment charge, the full year loss was $2.34 per average common share. In addition, key items affecting full year 2009 results included increased loan loss provision expense, decreased noninterest income, and the full year impact of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury.
"Our results clearly continue to be affected by recessionary pressures as evidenced by soft revenue and weak loan demand from consumer and commercial borrowers," said James M. Wells III, SunTrust chairman and chief executive officer. "At the same time, we are encouraged by some positive operating results and improved credit trends."
Mr. Wells noted that fourth quarter earnings fundamentals remain essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and that, with strong capital and excellent liquidity, SunTrust continues to operate from a position of strength in what appears to be an improving, yet still uncertain, economic environment. Further, he remarked, "our focus remains on the things we can control  client-focused execution, risk mitigation, and expense management  which will position SunTrust to deliver improving financial performance as the economy moves beyond this cycle."
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $1,949.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $22.7 million, or 1.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Net interest income was flat, and noninterest income increased slightly, primarily due to lower market-related losses during the current quarter offset by lower mortgage production income due to higher estimated losses related to the potential repurchase of mortgage loans that were previously sold to third parties. Fee-based core revenues were generally flat.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, fully taxable-equivalent total revenue was $8,299.3 million, a decrease of $911.4 million, or 9.9%, from 2008. Excluding net securities gains and losses, total revenue increased slightly due to lower market-related losses and higher mortgage-related income offset by lower net interest income in 2009 and net gains from the disposition of certain businesses and assets in 2008.
Net Interest Income
For the fourth quarter of 2009, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,206.8 million, essentially flat compared to the prior year, but up $38.6 million, or 3.3%, compared to the third quarter of 2009. Net interest income growth over the sequential quarter was due to a favorable change in mix of deposits resulting in lower funding costs. Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 3.27%, an increase of 17 basis points and 13 basis points over the third quarter of 2009 and fourth quarter of 2008, respectively. Rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 101 basis points while yields on earning assets declined 75 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The lack of loan demand and growth in deposits resulted in a $6.6 billion, or 4.3%, decline in average earning assets and an $11.3 billion, or 32.8%, decline in average non-deposit interest bearing funding.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $4,589.0 million, down $148.2 million, or 3.1%, compared to 2008. Net interest margin was 3.04% compared to 3.10% in 2008. The margin decline was driven primarily by increased nonperforming assets partially offset by a reduction in higher cost funding sources.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $742.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, which was $24.6 million, or 3.4%, above prior year. Income generation from both consumer and commercial clients resulted in relatively stable performance despite the overall weak business environment. Mortgage production related income declined $40.2 million due to higher mortgage loan repurchase costs partially offset by lower market valuation losses and a 17% increase in loan production during the current quarter. The fourth quarter of 2009 results include $220.2 million in estimated losses related to the potential repurchase of mortgage loans that were previously sold to third parties compared to $60.4 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. Certain mortgage loans are sold to Agencies in which the Company provides standard representations and warranties. If it is later determined that such representations have been breached, the
 
Agency will request the Company to bear the loss on such loan. The volume of repurchase requests from the Agencies increased each quarter during 2009. Each quarter the Company updates its loss estimate to reflect recent experience, and as a result the reserve for the repurchase of mortgage loans was increased by $77.2 million to $199.9 million as of December 31, 2009. The volume of repurchase requests shifted during the course of the year from 2006 and earlier vintages towards 2007 and later vintages. SunTrust believes its ultimate losses on newer vintages, particularly 2008 and later, may be lower than older vintages due to lower loss severities, a lower risk product mix, and enhanced underwriting guidelines and operating procedures.
Mortgage servicing income increased $382.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, as a result of the $370.0 million temporary impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to mortgage servicing rights that were carried at the lower of cost or market compared to a recovery of $10.5 million recognized during the current quarter. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $178.9 billion as of December 31, 2009, up from $162.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company elected to transfer the remaining portion of the mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market to fair value resulting in a $145 million increase in mortgage servicing rights and a $90 million increase in shareholders' equity. The fourth quarter of 2008 included $411.1 million of net gains from the sale of available for sale securities that were realized in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with hedging the value of mortgage servicing rights. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded $72.8 million of net gains from the sale of available for sale securities related to repositioning the investment portfolio, net of $3.9 million in other-than-temporary impairment on private mortgage-backed securities.
Trading account profits and commissions increased $30.7 million compared to the prior year quarter as market-related valuation losses on illiquid securities and other instruments carried at fair value improved and valuation losses on the Company's public debt and related hedges carried at fair value were $38.1 million, a reduction of $6.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. On a sequential quarter basis, valuation losses related to the public debt and related hedges carried at fair value declined $93.2 million. Trust and investment management income increased $8.2 million, or 6.5%, on increased performance based fees; however, retail investment income decreased $15.9 million, or 22.7%, due to lower transaction volume and client asset balances.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, noninterest income was $3,710.3 million, which was $763.2 million, or 17.1%, below 2008. The decline was primarily due to the 2008 gains of $1,073.3 million from the sale of available for sale securities, which were completed in conjunction with risk management strategies associated with mortgage servicing rights and the sale of a portion of The Coca-Cola Company stock. Further, the 2008 results included aggregate net gains of $321.4 million related to the disposition of certain assets and businesses while 2009 reflected the $112.1 million gain from the sale of Class B Visa shares. In 2009, the Company recorded $153.0 million of valuation losses on the public debt and related hedges carried at fair value compared to gains of $431.7 million in 2008, as credit spreads on SunTrust's debt tightened. Valuation losses on illiquid securities recorded in 2008 were not significant in 2009. Mortgage servicing income increased $541.7 million due, in part, to the $370.0 million impairment of mortgage servicing rights recognized in 2008 compared to the recovery of $199.2 million of impairment of mortgage servicing rights recognized in 2009. Mortgage production related income increased $204.7 million in 2009 due a 37.6% increase in loan production, higher margins, and lower valuation losses partially offset by increased losses related to the repurchase of mortgage loans. Trust and investment management fees declined 17.9% as the market value of average assets under management was lower in 2009 in addition to the sale in 2008 of certain asset management businesses. Other fee related income declined due to recessionary pressures.
 
Noninterest Expense
For the fourth quarter of 2009, noninterest expense was $1,453.6 million, a decrease of $132.6 million, or 8.4%, from the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of credit-related expenses declining significantly and controllable expenses continuing to be tightly managed. Operating losses declined $210.2 million, or 89.0%, as fraud-related credit losses were recorded in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs during 2009. Mortgage reinsurance losses declined $89.7 million, or 89.7%, as the Company's exposure to reinsurance losses have been limited to the funds contributed to the mortgage reinsurance trusts. Other credit-related expenses including collection and credit costs and other real estate expense increased $58.6 million due to property valuation losses and increased loss mitigation efforts. FDIC and regulatory expense increased $40.0 million, or 195.4%, in conjunction with the replenishment of the insurance fund through increased premiums. In the fourth quarter, the Company prepaid three years of expected FDIC premiums in accordance with a newly-enacted regulatory requirement. The total premium of $925 million will be amortized into expense over the next three years. Personnel expenses increased $56.1 million, or 8.8%, due to higher pension costs and increased incentives related to improved financial performance in certain lines of business. The fourth quarter of 2009 included $23.5 million in net losses related to the extinguishment of debt.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, total noninterest expense was $6,562.4 million, an increase of $683.4 million, or 11.6%, over 2008 primarily driven by the $751.2 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2009. Also included in 2008 were the $183.4 million charitable contribution expense and elevated credit-related expenses. Included in 2009 were higher FDIC costs, including the $78.2 million special assessment, increased pension expense, and higher outside processing expenses. Salaries and incentive expense declined in 2009 compared to 2008.
Income Taxes
For the fourth quarter, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $263.0 million compared to a tax benefit of $309.0 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The tax benefit was due to the recognition of a pre-tax loss, as well as other permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest income, settlement of examinations by certain taxing authorities, and federal tax credits. During the fourth quarter, the Company moved from a net deferred tax liability to a small net deferred tax asset of approximately $25 million. As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets for certain state net operating losses was approximately $53.2 million, and no valuation allowance was required against federal deferred tax assets.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
For the fourth quarter and full year of 2009, the Company recorded $66.5 million and $265.8 million, respectively, in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program during the fourth quarter of 2008. For 2008, the fourth quarter and full year preferred dividend was $26.6 million. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend requirement and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 2009, SunTrust had total assets of $174.2 billion and shareholders' equity of $22.5 billion, representing 12.9% of total assets. Book value per common share was $35.29 and tangible book value per common share was $22.59 as of December 31, 2009.
 
Loans
Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $115.0 billion, down $12.6 billion, or 9.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and down $4.8 billion, or 4.0%, compared to third quarter of 2009. Average commercial loans declined as a result of weak loan demand and improved access to the capital markets for funding. Average residential real estate and construction related loans declined as the Company continued to reduce exposure to particular residential real estate loan classes. As of December 31, 2009, total loans outstanding were $113.7 billion. Average loans held for sale for the current quarter declined $1.2 billion, or 22.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2009, as loan deliveries outpaced production.
Deposits
Consumer and commercial deposits in the fourth quarter of 2009 averaged $117.0 billion, an increase of $14.8 billion, or 14.4%, compared to the same quarter of 2008 and an increase of $2.5 billion, or 8.8%, on a sequential quarter annualized basis. Growth was most evident in the demand deposits, NOW and money market accounts while time deposits declined. Deposit growth is the result of client's increased preferences for insured deposits, competitive pricing, and effective marketing. Further, through an intense focus on improved execution, the Company has been successful in improving product offerings and client satisfaction, acquisition, and retention. Notwithstanding these deposit generation successes, some of the deposit growth is due to seasonality and the economic environment. Deposit balances are expected to decline modestly in the first quarter related to seasonality, and further over time as the economy improves. Total client deposits as of December 31, 2009, were $116.3 billion. Average brokered and foreign deposits for the fourth quarter of 2009 declined a combined $7.5 billion, or 59.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, as the Company's deposit growth enabled a reduction in wholesale funding sources.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 common, Tier 1 capital and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios were 7.65%, 12.90% and 9.66%, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. The Company's estimated Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios increased in the quarter as the decline in risk weighted assets more than offset the reduction in capital due to the Company's net loss. The Company continues to have substantial liquidity, as the inflows of deposits have been largely retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
For the fourth quarter, the provision for credit losses was $973.7 million and included $57.2 million in provision for unfunded commitments. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company elected to change its financial statement presentation to include the provision for unfunded commitments in the provision for credit losses. Previously, the unfunded commitment provision was included in noninterest expense. The provision for loan losses was $217.4 million below the provision for loan losses recorded in the third quarter and $46.0 million below the provision for loan losses recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.
For the fourth quarter of 2009, net charge-offs were $820.5 million, down $185.4 million, or 18.4%, from the third quarter driving a 50 basis point improvement in the ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans to 2.83%. Net charge-offs for the quarter pertained primarily to first and second lien residential mortgages and real estate construction loans. Net charge-offs declined across most loan categories, except residential construction, as a result of continued workout activities. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, net charge-offs were up $268.0 million primarily due to residential real estate loans.
As of December 31, 2009, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $3,120.0 million, up $96.0 million over September 30, 2009. As a percentage of loans outstanding, the allowance for loan losses was 2.76%, up 15 basis points from the third quarter and 90 basis points from December 31, 2008. The increase
 
in the allowance for loan losses was primarily related to residential mortgages. The $96 million increase in allowance for loan losses compares favorably to the quarterly increases of $128 million, $161 million, $384 million, and $410 million over the previous four quarters. The reserve for unfunded commitments ended the year at $114.9 million.
Nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2009, totaled $5,402.6 million, down $41.7 million from September 30, 2009, and $101.3 million from June 30, 2009, primarily due to charge-offs and declines in commercial and construction nonperforming loans. The growth in the allowance for loan losses and reduction in nonperforming loans caused the allowance to nonperforming loans ratio to increase 219 basis points to 58.86%. As of December 31, 2009, nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans was 4.75%, up 8 basis points from the end of the third quarter and up 165 basis points from December 31, 2008. As nonperforming loans migrate to foreclosure and ultimate disposition, other real estate owned increased $48.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2009.
Accruing restructured loans totaled $1,640.9 million as of December 31, 2009, as compared to $1,343.6 million as of September 30, 2009 and $462.6 million as of December 31, 2008. These loans are primarily consumer loans secured by residential real estate and the increases reflect the Company's proactive steps to modify loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties and to mitigate losses. Most of the restructured loans are performing in accordance with their modified terms.
Total early stage delinquencies declined 15 basis points during the fourth quarter to 1.37% of total loans due primarily to improvements in commercial and commercial real estate loans. Early stage delinquencies declined as a percentage of loans outstanding in spite of a decline of $2.8 billion in loans outstanding. Late stage delinquencies also improved modestly from the prior quarter.

Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; recent levels of market volatility are unprecedented; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; recently enacted legislation or any proposed federal programs subject us to increased regulation and may adversely affect us; we have not yet received permission to repay TARP funds; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to
 
credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of real estate, increases in unemployment, and the related effects on local economies may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our actual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the fair value of such assets; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; ratings agencies recently downgraded our securities and the deposit ratings of SunTrust Bank. These downgrades and any subsequent downgrades could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities and could have an impact on our businesses and results of operations; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel. If these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries; and we are subject to market risk associated with our asset management and commercial paper conduit businesses.

Total revenue, net interest margin, and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

See Appendix A for reconcilements of non-GAAP performance measures.
1
Total revenue, net interest margin, and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Total revenue - FTE equals net interest income on a FTE basis plus noninterest income.

RECONCILEMENT OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
APPENDIX A TO THE EARNINGS RELEASE
(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited)
 
 
 
SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. The foregoing numbers primarily reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of common shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net income, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities gains.
1
SunTrust believes that the return on average realized common shareholders' equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders' equity is computed by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders' equity.
2
Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents total revenue- FTE excluding net realized securities (gains)/losses. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities (gains)/losses is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
6
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Unaudited)
 
 
 
 
SunTrust presents noninterest expense, net income/(loss), net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, and net income/(loss) per average common diluted share that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charges provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance.

The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an accounting perspective is different from the economic perspective due to the election of fair value accounting for certain long term debt and the related interest rate swaps. The net interest income sensitivity profile from an economic perspective assumes the net interest payments from the related swaps were included in net interest income.
