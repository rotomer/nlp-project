For Immediate Release
April 21, 2010
 
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported a net loss available to common shareholders for the first quarter of 2010 of $229 million, or $0.46 per average common share, as the lingering effects of the recession impacted results. This compares to a net loss available to common shareholders of $875 million, or $2.49 per average common share in the first quarter of 2009, and a net loss per average common share of $0.64 for the fourth quarter of 2009.
The first quarter of 2009 net loss included a non-cash charge of $715 million, or $2.03 per average common share, related to the impairment of goodwill. Excluding the goodwill charge, the net loss per average common share in the first quarter of 2009 was $0.46, equal to the first quarter of 2010.
"We are increasingly encouraged by current operating trends and our outlook for the future," said James M. Wells III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc. While the outlook for economic recovery remains uncertain, Mr. Wells noted that the quarter's results were most positively affected by improved asset quality which resulted in a significant decrease in credit-related costs, including provision for credit losses.
"Our client-focused strategies, expense management discipline and lower cost deposit mix are yielding results," he added. "We believe that as the economy continues to gain traction, our strong capital position will enable SunTrust to operate from a position of strength, capitalize on opportunities in the markets and businesses in which we compete, and drive improved shareholder value."
First Quarter 2010 Consolidated Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Fully taxable-equivalent revenue, excluding securities gains and losses, declined 14.2% compared to the first quarter of 2009; however, on a sequential quarter basis it increased slightly due to higher noninterest income. The year-over-year decrease was due to a 37.7% decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a 10.0% increase in net interest income. Noninterest income in the current quarter was adversely impacted by lower mortgage production and higher mortgage repurchase charges compared to the first quarter of 2009. The current quarter also included $20 million of mark-to-market losses on the Company's debt and related hedges carried at fair value, while the first quarter of 2009 reflected $113 million in mark-to-market gains.
Net Interest Income
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1,202 million in the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 10.0% over the first quarter of 2009 and essentially flat compared to the sequential quarter despite two fewer days in the current quarter. Average earning assets were relatively flat compared to the sequential quarter partially as a result of the addition of approximately $1.6 billion of average assets from previously unconsolidated entities in connection with our adoption of recently issued accounting standards. Average earning assets declined $7.5 billion, or 4.9%, compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to a decline in average loans (including loans held for sale) and trading assets, partially offset by an increase in average securities available for sale.
Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2010 was 3.32%, a 45 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2009 and a 5 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by the decline in our funding costs. Significantly higher low cost deposits and lower wholesale funding contributed to the 75 basis point year-over-year decline in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. Loan yields have remained relatively stable over the past five quarters benefiting from receive fixed/pay floating interest swaps on commercial loans.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $698 million for the first quarter of 2010, down $423 million, or 37.7%, from the first quarter of 2009 and down $44 million, or 5.9%, on a sequential quarter basis. The decline in year-over-year noninterest income was driven primarily by mortgage production income and trading account profits and commissions. The fourth quarter of 2009 also included $73 million in net gains realized from the sale of securities related to the repositioning of the investment portfolio.
 
Mortgage production income declined $281 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Current quarter results included $128 million of estimated mortgage repurchase losses compared to $26 million in the first quarter of 2009. Mortgage repurchase reserves remained relatively stable at $210 million as of March 31, 2010, up $10 million from year end, due to a leveling off of investor repurchase demands. Estimated repurchase losses during the fourth quarter of 2009 were $220 million. Mortgage production income was also affected by lower loan applications and originations, which declined approximately 60% compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Mortgage servicing income declined $13 million from the first quarter of 2009, as $17 million in higher servicing fees in the current quarter were offset by $31 million of impairment recovery recognized in the first quarter of 2009. Mortgage servicing income increased $24 million, or 51.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to improved performance of the hedge on mortgage servicing rights. As of March 31, 2010, SunTrust serviced $178.0 billion in mortgage loans, up 7.0%, from the first quarter of 2009.
Trading account profits and commissions declined $115 million compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, during the current quarter, the Company recorded $20 million of mark-to-market valuation losses on its public debt and related hedges carried at fair value compared to $113 million of valuation gains in the first quarter of 2009 and $38 million of valuation losses in the fourth quarter of 2009. This quarter's trading income also included $16 million in valuation losses related to the deterioration of collateral on previously securitized loans, net of valuation gains on illiquid securities, and certain trading assets, compared to a net mark-to-market loss of $34 million in the first quarter of 2009. Capital markets-related trading income and investment banking fees declined slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower equity and fixed income derivatives revenue and reduced deal flow, while the sequential quarter improved modestly primarily due to improved fixed income sales and derivatives revenue.
Other fee based revenue from both consumer and commercial clients was mixed across the various income categories but generally flat in total relative to the first quarter of 2009. Fee based income declined on a sequential basis due to lower NSF and client analysis fees and seasonal declines in other revenue categories.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2010 was $1,361 million, down $791 million, or 36.8%, from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the $751 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009, noninterest expense declined $40 million, or 2.7%, driven by lower credit-related and personnel expenses, partially offset by lower gains on the extinguishment of debt. Credit-related costs, including other real estate owned, credit and collections, operating losses, and mortgage reinsurance, declined $45 million, or 23.8%. The decline in mortgage reinsurance expense was partially offset by increased credit and collections expense due to losses from advances on delinquent loans serviced for others. Personnel expenses declined $44 million, or 6.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to lower pension expense from higher discount rates and improved performance in the underlying retirement plan assets. Incentive compensation declined in conjunction with the soft revenue generation. FDIC insurance and regulatory expense increased $17 million, or 35.5%, over the first quarter of 2009 in conjunction with higher average deposits and increased premiums associated with the replenishment of the FDIC deposit insurance fund.
On a sequential quarter basis, noninterest expense was down $93 million, or 6.4%. The decline was driven by a $31 million decline in credit-related expenses, specifically operating losses and other real estate owned losses, a $14 million decline in marketing expenses due to the timing of various marketing campaigns, and a $9 million gain from the extinguishment of debt during the current quarter compared to a $24 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Income Taxes
For the first quarter of 2010, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $194 million, which compares to a $151 million benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The tax benefit was due to the recognition of a pre-tax loss, as well as other permanent tax items such as tax exempt interest and federal tax credits. The first quarter of 2009 effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the $677 million non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment. The impact of the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not have a significant impact on the Company's provision for income taxes.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company recorded $66 million in preferred dividends in each of the current and prior year quarters related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2010, total assets were $171.8 billion, which included $1.5 billion of loans related to the consolidation of our asset-backed commercial paper conduit and $323 million of loans held for sale related to the consolidation of a collateralized loan obligation vehicle as a result of recently issued accounting standards. Shareholders' equity of $22.6 billion as of March 31, 2010 represented 13.2% of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were $35.40 and $22.76, respectively, as of March 31, 2010.
Loans
Average loans for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $114.4 billion, down $10.9 billion, or 8.7%, from the first quarter of 2009. Average real estate construction and residential mortgage loans declined $6.3 billion, or 16.8%, as the Company continued its efforts to reduce its exposure to residential real estate. Commercial loans declined $6.1 billion, or 15.6%, due to weak client demand resulting in lower utilization of lines of credit. Average loans were essentially flat compared to the sequential quarter; however, the first quarter average includes approximately $1.4 billion of loans as a result of the consolidation of previously off-balance sheet loans. As of March 31, 2010, total loans were $114.0 billion, up $305 million from year end.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the first quarter of 2010 were $115.1 billion, up $7.6 billion, or 7.0%, from the first quarter of 2009. Deposit growth was concentrated in lower cost deposits, including NOW accounts, money market accounts, and demand deposits, which increased on average $13.0 billion, or 17.7%, while higher cost time deposits declined $5.8 billion, or 19.0%. Growth in consumer and commercial deposits has enabled a further decline in average brokered and foreign deposits, which declined by $4.0 billion year-over-year, or 53.7%, as well as non-deposit interest-bearing funding, which declined $10.3 billion, or 29.5%. As anticipated, average consumer and commercial deposits declined slightly on a sequential quarter basis due largely to a decline in higher cost time deposits and, in part, due to seasonal declines in certain commercial client accounts. As of March 31, 2010, total consumer and commercial deposits were $116.1 billion, down $160 million from year end.
 
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios at March 31, 2010, were 7.65%, 13.05%, and 9.86%, down two basis points, up nine basis points, and up twenty basis points, respectively, compared to December 31, 2009. Despite the challenging economic environment, the Company's capital position remains strong. The Company also has substantial available liquidity as the inflows of high quality deposits have largely been retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
During the current quarter, overall asset quality improved notably. Early stage delinquencies, nonperforming loans, and net charge-offs remain elevated but improved sequentially, and in some cases, significantly. Nonetheless, the economic outlook remains uncertain, resulting in the allowance for credit losses remaining relatively stable for the time being. As of March 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was $3,176 million, an increase of $56 million from year end, and it represented 2.80% of total loans compared to 2.76% and 2.21% of total loans as December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2009, respectively. The unfunded commitment reserve ended the current quarter at $100 million, down $15 million from year end due to a reduction in exposure related to certain commercial and large corporate clients.
For the first quarter of 2010, the provision for credit losses was $862 million. The provision for credit losses in the current quarter was $132 million lower than the first quarter of 2009 and $112 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2009, continuing the trend of declining provision over the last year.
Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2010 were $821 million, approximately equal to the amount in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $211 million higher than the first quarter of 2009. Charge-offs in the current quarter include $51 million of incremental charge-offs associated with the transfer of $211 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans to loans held for sale. The Company is in the process of actively marketing these loans and intends to sell the loans during the second quarter. Also, during the current quarter, incremental charge-offs of $131 million were recorded on severely delinquent residential mortgage loans with collateral located in jurisdictions in which we are experiencing extended foreclosure periods, primarily Florida. The losses on these severely delinquent loans arose from declines in collateral value while the loans were in foreclosure. These estimated declines in value are captured in our estimated allowance for loan losses. Historically, our process was to record the additional charge-off when the foreclosure process was completed; however, due to the protracted amount of time loans are remaining in the foreclosure process, we concluded that it was appropriate to record an additional charge-off after twelve months had lapsed from the initial charge-off, generally at 180 days past due. These combined actions increased charge-offs $182 million and reduced nonperforming loans by $341 million. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans for the current quarter was 2.91% (including 0.65% related to the $182 million of charge-offs discussed above) compared to 2.83% in the sequential quarter and 1.97% in the first quarter of 2009. The sequential quarter increase in residential mortgage net charge-offs of $84 million was due to the items discussed above. The $88 million decrease in construction net charge-offs was due to the extended foreclosure process in Florida and the uneven nature over which construction net charge-offs generally occur.
 
Nonaccrual loans were $5,185 million, or 4.55% of total loans, as of March 31, 2010, compared to $5,402 million, or 4.75% of total loans, as of December 31, 2009, and $4,641 million, or 3.75% of total loans, as of March 31, 2009. In the current quarter, higher nonaccrual construction loans were offset by reductions in nonaccrual commercial loans and residential mortgage loans, including the $341 million reduction discussed above. As of March 31, 2010, the allowance to nonperforming loans was 61.7%, up 2.9% from year end and 1.4% from a year ago. Early stage delinquencies as of the end of the first quarter were 1.19% of total loans, a decline of 18 basis points compared to year end driven primarily by declines in consumer loans. Late stage delinquencies were relatively flat compared to year end.
The Company continues to proactively modify loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties in an effort to mitigate losses. Accordingly, accruing restructured loans increased 16.2% during the current quarter to $1.9 billion.

APPENDIX A TO THE EARNINGS RELEASE

SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. The foregoing numbers primarily reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of common shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net loss, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities gains.
1
SunTrust believes that the return on average realized common shareholders' equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders' equity is computed by dividing annualized net loss available to common shareholders, excluding securities gains/losses and The Coca-Cola Company dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders' equity.
2
Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - - FTE. The efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents total revenue- FTE excluding net realized securities (gains)/losses. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities (gains)/losses is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
6
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
7
Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiary's federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiary's income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

SunTrust presents noninterest expense, net loss, net loss available to common shareholders, and net loss per average common diluted share that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charges provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses this measure internally to analyze performance.

The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an accounting perspective is different from the economic perspective due to the election of fair value accounting for certain long term debt and the related interest rate swaps. The net interest income sensitivity profile from an economic perspective assumes the net interest payments from the related swaps were included in net interest income.
