As depicted in the table below, the total principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Early Tender Date was $942,497,000, which exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount.

The final pro-ration factor for Notes in Acceptance Priority Level 2 will not be available until the Tender Offer expires at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 20, 2010. All Notes validly tendered and not accepted will be returned to investors as soon as possible.
The purchase prices of the Notes in the Tender Offer will be set later today in accordance with procedures described in the Offer to Purchase dated July 26, 2010. The settlement date is scheduled to be August 23, 2010. The Company will announce final results of the Tender Offer on that date.

Global Bondholder Services Corporation is acting as Information Agent. Contact information for the dealer managers and the Information Agent is listed on the back cover of the Offer to Purchase.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell with respect to any securities. Any such offer or solicitation will be made only by means of the Offer to Purchase dated July 26, 2010.
