(a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of the Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Agent or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto), any applicable Free Writing Prospectus or any applicable Time of Sale Information relating to the Program Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse each Agent and each such controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Agent or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable to an Agent or person controlling such Agent in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein; and provided further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any Time of Sale Information relating to the Program Securities, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Agent (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Agent) from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the applicable Program Securities, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Agent or such controlling person results from the fact that a copy of any subsequent Time of Sale Information (which did not contain any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission) was delivered to such Agent by the Company on a timely basis enabling such Agent so to send, give or make available a copy of such subsequent Time of Sale Information in accordance with such Agent's customary procedures. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or in any amendment or supplement thereto), any Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information relating to the Program Securities, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for use therein; and will, as such expenses are incurred, reimburse any legal or
 
other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that such Agent may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnifying party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.
(d) If recovery is not available under the foregoing indemnification provisions of this Section, for any reason other than as specified therein, the parties entitled to indemnification by the terms thereof shall be entitled to contribution for liabilities and expenses, except to the extent that contribution is not permitted under Section 11(f) of the Act. In determining the amount of contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any Agent on the other from the offering by it pursuant to this Agreement of the Program Securities that are the subject of the action (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the commissions or underwriting discounts received by such Agent relating to the Program Securities that are the subject of the action and which were distributed to the public through it pursuant to this Agreement or upon resale of Program Securities purchased by it from the Company exceed the amount of any damages that such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

10. . In soliciting offers to purchase Program Securities pursuant to this Agreement and in performing its other obligations hereunder, each Agent is acting individually and not jointly with the other Agents and, except as contemplated by Section 4, is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal.

11. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and the Agents set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any Terms Agreement, as the case may be, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as to the results thereof made by or on behalf of any Agent, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of and payment for the Program Securities. If this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12 or for any other reason, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5(i) to the extent actually incurred by or committed to by an Agent to the date of such termination, the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(c) shall remain in effect until the settlement of all pending deliveries of and payment for securities and the respective obligations of the Company and the Agents pursuant to Section 9 and the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 5(e) shall remain in effect.

12. . (a) The Company may elect to suspend or terminate the offering of Program Securities under this Agreement at any time.

The provisions of Sections 5(c), 5(e), 5(i), 9 and 11 hereof shall survive any termination of the Terms Agreement.
(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of termination of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement with respect to any Agent, such Agent shall not receive any
 
compensation except in connection with a purchase by it of Program Securities actually consummated, provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit the provisions of Section 9, and that reimbursement by the Company to an Agent of out-of-pocket accountable expenses actually incurred by such Agent and to which such Agent is otherwise entitled as provided herein shall not be prohibited.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have audited:
 
 
 
The consolidated financial statements and management's assessment referred to above are all incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-161712) on Form S-3 filed by the Firm under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"); our report with respect thereto is also incorporated by reference in such registration statement. Such registration statement, together with the Prospectus dated September 3, 2009 and the Prospectus Supplement dated [], 2010 in connection with the offering of Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A are herein collectively referred to as the Registration Statement.
                    
In connection with the Registration Statement:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit made in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations as to the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
 
 
 
 
On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change, increase or decrease, except in all instances for changes, increases or decreases which the Registration Statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
[Officials of the Firm informed us however, that they can make no comments with respect to consolidated net income for the period from [                    ] to [                    ], as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, or to decreases in total stockholders' equity as of [                    ], as compared with the corresponding amount shown in the [                    ] unaudited consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement.]
 
For purposes of this letter, when performing procedures on average balances, we make no comment as to the appropriateness of the Firm's method of computing average balances.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing procedures are substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion on management's assumptions, the pro forma adjustments, and the application of those adjustments to historical financial information. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The foregoing procedures would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representation about the sufficiency of such procedures for your purposes.]
