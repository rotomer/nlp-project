ATLANTA SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) announced today that stronger revenue performance and a continued decline in credit-related costs resulted in net income available to common shareholders of $84 million, or $0.17 per average common diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010. The Company reported a net loss of $377 million, or $0.76 per average common share, in the third quarter of 2009 and a net loss of $56 million, or $0.11 per average common share, in the second quarter of 2010.
"The revenue generation of our core business and continued strength of the balance sheet affirms our confidence that our client-centric strategies are gaining traction and driving better results," said James M. Wells III, chairman and chief executive officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc. "While decreasing credit costs are certainly welcomed, we are even more encouraged by the improvement in our operating results that are being driven by several of our lines of business." Mr. Wells also noted an improvement in net interest income, a result of increased earning assets and continued favorable deposit trends.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
For the third quarter of 2010, total revenue rose 7% on a sequential quarter basis and increased 19% over the third quarter of 2009. Revenue growth was driven by higher net interest income and growth in fee-based income, particularly mortgage and capital markets-related revenues. Mark-to-market valuation losses, net of hedges, on the Company's public debt and index-linked certificates of deposits carried at fair value were $81 million in the third quarter compared to gains of $86 million in the second quarter of 2010 and losses of $145 million in the third quarter of 2009. The current quarter included net gains of $69 million from the sale of securities, compared to gains of $57 million and $47 million in the prior quarter and third quarter of 2009, respectively.
For the nine months, total revenue was $6.4 billion, essentially flat compared to the same period in 2009. Higher net interest income, gains on the Company's debt carried at fair value compared to losses in 2009, and gains on the sale of securities in 2010 were offset by lower mortgage production income and service charges in 2010. Additionally, the Company recognized a $112 million gain from the sale of Visa shares in the second quarter of 2009.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2009 and 5% on a sequential quarter basis. Higher average securities available for sale and total loans contributed to a 1% increase in average earning assets on a sequential quarter basis. Compared to a year ago, average earning assets declined $2.3 billion, or 2%, primarily attributable to declines in loans and loans held for sale, partially offset by an increase in average securities available for sale.
Net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.41%, up 31 basis points from the same quarter last year and eight basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower funding costs. Growth in lower-cost deposits, coupled with significant reductions in higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt contributed to a 49 basis point year-over-year decline in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.
For the nine months, net interest income was $3.7 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year, while net interest margin increased 38 basis points to 3.35%. The same factors in the quarterly year-over-year comparisons contributed to the nine month increase in net interest income and margin.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1.0 billion for the third quarter of 2010, a $95 million, or 10%, sequential quarter increase primarily driven by higher mortgage and capital markets-related income, partially offset by lower service charges. Due to improvement in the Company's credit spreads during the quarter, the Company recorded market valuation losses, net of hedges, on its public debt and index-linked certificates of deposit carried at fair value of $81 million compared to a gain of $86 million in the prior quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, noninterest income increased $272 million, or 35%, due to higher mortgage and capital markets-related income, partially offset by lower service charges. In addition, the third quarter of 2009 included $145 million in mark-to-market net losses on the Company's public debt and index-linked certificates of deposit carried at fair value. In the current quarter, gains from the sale of securities associated with repositioning the investment portfolio were $69 million compared to $57 million in the prior quarter and $47 million in the third quarter of 2009.
 
 
Mortgage production income increased significantly due to lower interest rates, increasing $150 million over the prior quarter and $105 million over the third quarter of 2009, as application volumes increased over 25% and margins expanded compared to the second quarter of 2010. Estimated mortgage repurchase losses recognized during the current quarter were $95 million, compared to $148 million in the prior quarter and $136 million in the third quarter of 2009. As of September 30, 2010, mortgage repurchase reserves totaled $270 million, up $14 million during the quarter.
Mortgage servicing income for the quarter was $132 million, which was $44 million higher than the prior quarter due to improved hedge performance. Net hedge performance in the current quarter was $74 million compared to $35 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage servicing income for the third quarter of 2009 was $60 million. As of September 30, 2010, the Company serviced $176.6 billion in mortgage loans, down slightly compared to the prior year.
Trading account profits and commissions decreased $130 million on a sequential quarter basis in the third quarter of 2010 primarily due to the mark-to-market valuation losses, net of hedges, on the Company's public debt and index-linked certificates of deposits carried at fair value. The Company has historically recorded certain index-linked certificates of deposits at fair value. The outstanding balance of these deposits since September 30, 2009 has remained stable at approximately $1.2 billion. The mark-to-market valuation gains and losses related to these instruments in prior periods has been relatively insignificant; however, during the current quarter, improvement in the Company's credit spreads combined with the significant decline in interest rates resulted in a $59 million mark-to-market loss. Excluding these debt-related mark-to-market losses, trading income increased due to higher fixed income and derivatives trading income. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, trading account profits and commissions increased $65 million, primarily due to the $64 million reduction in mark-to-market valuation losses on the Company's public debt and index-linked certificates of deposit carried at fair value. Increased mergers and acquisition advisory fees and bond underwriting activities drove a 66% increase in investment banking income on a sequential quarter basis and a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009.
Noninterest income in the current quarter from consumer and commercial fee-based services was generally higher compared to the prior quarter and third quarter of 2009 with the exception of service charges on deposits. During the current quarter, service charges on deposits were impacted by the recently enacted regulations requiring clients to elect whether to opt in to certain account transaction services. Service charges declined $24 million, or 11%, on a sequential quarter basis, and $35 million, or 16%, compared to the third quarter of 2009.
For the nine months, total noninterest income was $2.7 billion, down 9% compared to the same period of 2009. The decline was largely due to lower mortgage production income from increased mortgage repurchase losses and lower loan production in 2010, lower service charges in 2010, and the gain on the sale of Visa shares of $112 million recorded in 2009, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of securities and reduced mark-to-market value losses on the Company's debt instruments carried at fair value in 2010.
Noninterest Expense
Total noninterest expense in the current quarter was $1.5 billion, up $70 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2009. Increases in employee compensation-related expenses, FDIC insurance premiums, outside processing and software expense, and debt extinguishment costs drove the year-over-year increase in noninterest expense, which was partially offset by lower credit-related costs. Personnel-related expenses increased primarily due to higher salary and contract labor expense. Full-time equivalent employees increased by 584 compared to September 30, 2009, with the majority of the increase occurring in retail branches and client support areas. Higher incentive compensation related to improved business performance, including higher mortgage loan production, also contributed to the increase in personnel-related
 
expenses. Credit-related expenses were $180 million in the current quarter, down $34 million, or 16%, primarily due to the $29 million of expense related to the reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in the third quarter of 2009; beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, this expense was included in provision for credit losses. FDIC insurance premiums increased due to higher deposit balances and assessment rates that became effective in the fourth quarter of 2009. Outside processing and software expense increased $10 million, or 7%, due to higher transaction volume and increased investment in software. Debt extinguishment costs of $12 million were related to the repayment of $1.0 billion of long-term debt during the third quarter of 2010.
On a sequential quarter basis, debt extinguishment costs declined $51 million. Personnel expenses increased $26 million, or 4%. Full-time equivalent employees increased 349 with the majority attributable to increased mortgage production. Incentive compensation also increased related to higher revenue. The increase in other noninterest expense was primarily due to legal-related expenses. Credit-related expenses remained stable as increases in operating losses were offset by reductions in other real estate expenses.
For the nine months, total noninterest expense was $4.4 billion, a decrease of $747 million, or 15%, compared to the same period in 2009. The decline was primarily due to the $751 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2009. FDIC insurance premiums declined $45 million, primarily due to the special assessment paid in the second quarter of 2009. Credit-related expenses remained elevated but declined $43 million compared to a year ago, as mortgage reinsurance costs declined $80 million, partially offset by a $28 million increase in other real estate expenses. Marketing and customer development costs increased 18% on increased promotional and advertising spending, while outside processing expense increased 8% for the same reasons cited in the year-over-year quarterly comparison. Debt extinguishment costs increased $51 million.
Income Taxes
For the third quarter of 2010, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $14 million, compared to a benefit of $336 million for the third quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 8.25%.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
For the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $67 million and $200 million, respectively, in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of September 30, 2010, SunTrust had total assets of $174.7 billion and shareholders' equity of $23.4 billion, representing 13.42% of total assets. Book value per common share was $37.01 as of September 30, 2010.
Loans
Average loans for the third quarter of 2010 were $113.3 billion, down $6.5 billion, or 5%, compared to the third quarter of 2009. The decline was concentrated in the construction, residential real estate, commercial and commercial real estate loan categories. The Company continues to reduce its exposure to residential real estate, most notably real estate construction loans, which, on average, declined 39% from the third quarter of 2009. On a sequential quarter basis, average loans increased slightly as declines in commercial real estate and home equity lines were offset by growth in consumer loans and government
 
guaranteed residential mortgage loans. Consumer loan growth included the purchase of a high-quality $741 million consumer auto loan portfolio. The Company also consolidated a $467 million student loan portfolio at the end of the third quarter of 2010. As of September 30, 2010, total loans outstanding were $115.1 billion compared to $112.9 billion as of June 30, 2010, up 2%. During the current quarter, loan originations totaled $19.7 billion, including renewals and loan commitments, which is 12% greater than the prior quarter.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the third quarter of 2010 totaled $117.2 billion, up 2% from the third quarter of 2009. As clients continued to migrate to more liquid products, average demand deposits and money market accounts increased $2.0 billion, or 8%, and $7.3 billion, or 23%, respectively, while consumer time deposits and other time deposits declined $6.5 billion, or 22%. Average total brokered and foreign deposits declined $2.5 billion, or 47%, from the third quarter of 2009, as the Company's deposit growth initiatives replaced these wholesale funding sources with client deposits. On a sequential quarter basis, average consumer and commercial deposits increased 1%, with the majority of the increase in lower-cost deposits.
Capital and Liquidity
The Company's capital ratios remained strong at September 30, 2010, with estimated Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios of 8.00%, 13.60%, and 10.19%, respectively. The increase in the Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios was due to earnings in the quarter as risk weighted assets increased marginally due to growth in high-quality loans and investment securities. The Company's regulatory capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements and the guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Company also has substantial available liquidity, as the inflows of client deposits have largely been retained in cash or invested in high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality trends continued to improve during the quarter with net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, and nonperforming assets all declining compared to the prior quarter. Early stage delinquencies remained relatively stable, declining 2 basis points to 1.24%. The allowance for loan losses declined $70 million to $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2010. The allowance for loan losses was 2.69% of total loans, down 12 basis points from June 30, 2010 due to the decline in the allowance for loan losses combined with higher period-end loan balances. As of September 30, 2010, approximately 7% of the Company's loan portfolio was substantially guaranteed by the federal government and its agencies. The allowance to nonperforming loans was 71.07% as of September 30, 2010, up 343 basis points from June 30, 2010. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $55 million at quarter end, down $5 million from June 30, 2010, due to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate clients.
The provision for credit losses was $615 million, a decline of $47 million on a sequential quarter basis and a decline of $519 million from the third quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs in the current quarter were $690 million, down $316 million from the same quarter last year and down $32 million on a sequential quarter basis. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, net charge-offs in all loan categories declined with the exception of a small increase in commercial real estate-related loans. On a sequential quarter basis, net charge-offs related to construction and commercial loans declined but were partially offset by increases in the commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios. Net charge-offs to average annualized loans declined to 2.42% in the current quarter, down 91 basis points from the same period in 2009 and down 15 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. Year-to-date, net charge-offs were $2.2 billion, down $184 million, or 8%, from the same period in 2009, while the provision for credit losses was down $952 million, or 31%.
 
 
Nonaccrual loans declined, continuing a trend that began in the third quarter of 2009, and totaled $4.4 billion, or 3.80% of total loans, as of September 30, 2010. This compares to $5.4 billion, or 4.67%, of total loans as of September 30, 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by residential mortgages and construction loans; however, all nonaccrual loan categories have declined except for commercial real estate, which increased $182 million compared to a year ago. Nonaccrual loans declined $326 million, or 7%, on a sequential quarter basis with all loan categories stable or down. The overall decline in nonaccrual loans was due to repayments, net charge-offs, transfers to other real estate owned, and reduced inflows into nonaccrual. Despite the migrations of nonperforming loans into other real estate owned, OREO declined $55 million during the quarter to $645 million as of September 30, 2010.
Efforts to assist clients that are experiencing financial difficulties have continued during the third quarter resulting in loan modifications. Accruing restructured loans totaled $2.5 billion as of September 30, 2010, an increase of $247 million over the prior quarter end. The increase primarily related to residential mortgages, with commercial real estate related restructured loans increasing $17 million. Nonaccruing restructured loans remained relatively stable at $988 million.

This news release includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrust's performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided within or in the appendix to this news release. In this news release, the Company presents net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis, and ratios on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.
This news release may contain forward-looking statements. Statements regarding future levels of net interest margin, future levels of and rates of change in delinquencies, future levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, the future level of service charge income, the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, the level of future losses from repurchase requests, the size of future reserve additions, future levels of litigation related costs, and future levels of the allowance for loan losses are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "targets," "initiatives," "potentially," "probably," "projects," "outlook" or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "should," "would," and "could."

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our 10-K and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; recent levels of market volatility are unprecedented; we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; recently enacted legislation, or legislation enacted in the future, or any proposed federal programs subject us to increased regulation and may adversely affect us; we have not yet received permission to repay TARP funds; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including
 
specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of real estate, increases in unemployment, and the related effects on local economies may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; in 2009 and 2010, credit rating agencies downgraded the credit ratings of SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Banks, Inc., and these downgrades and any subsequent downgrades could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities and could have an impact on our businesses and results of operations; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.
