Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated Financial Performance
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue of $2.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010 was essentially flat on a sequential quarter basis as higher net interest income was partially offset by a slight decline in noninterest income. Declines in mortgage-related income were largely offset by higher trading income, primarily due to more favorable mark-to-market impacts. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, total revenue increased 19% on higher net interest income and noninterest income, particularly mortgage and capital markets-related income. The current quarter included net gains of $64 million from the sale of securities, compared to net gains of $69 million and $73 million in the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, total revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of $400 million, or 5%, from 2009, which was substantially attributable to higher net interest income. Noninterest income was essentially flat, as declines in mortgage production income and service charges on deposits were offset by an increase in trading income due to lower mark-to-market losses, net of hedges, on the Company's debt carried at fair value. The current year included net gains of $191 million from the sale of securities, compared to net gains of $210 million in 2009 related to the sale of securities and Visa shares.
Net Interest Income
For the fourth quarter of 2010, net interest income was $1.3 billion, an increase of 2% on a sequential quarter basis and up 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Net interest income growth over the third quarter was attributable to lower rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, as well as the continued shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2009, these same factors drove the growth, together with a significant reduction in higher-cost time deposits and longer-term debt balances.
Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 3.44%, an increase of 3 basis points on a sequential quarter basis. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net interest margin increased 17 basis points, primarily driven by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which more than offset a 17 basis point decline in earning asset yields.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, net interest income was $5.0 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2009. Net interest margin was 3.38%, up 34 basis points over 2009. The same factors that drove the quarterly year-over-year increases contributed to the full-year net interest income and margin growth.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, down $15 million, or 1%, on a sequential quarter basis. The decline in mortgage-related income and service charges on deposit accounts was partially offset by more favorable mark-to-market valuation impacts included in trading account profits and commissions. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, noninterest income increased $290 million, or 39%, primarily due to higher capital markets and mortgage-related income, as well as higher mark-to-market valuation impacts, partially offset by lower service charges. Gains on the sale of securities associated with the repositioning of the investment portfolio were $64 million, $69 million, and $73 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively.
Mortgage servicing income declined $64 million compared to the third quarter, due to a reduction in net hedge performance and the negative impact that higher prepayments had on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, mortgage servicing income increased
 
$21 million due to higher net hedge performance. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $167.2 billion as of December 31, 2010, down from $178.9 billion at December 31, 2009.
Mortgage production income declined $92 million from the third quarter, due to lower mortgage production volume and reduced margins. The provision for mortgage repurchase losses was $85 million in the current quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, mortgage production related income increased $109 million primarily due to a $136 million decline in the provision for mortgage repurchase losses. As of December 31, 2010, mortgage repurchase reserves totaled $265 million.
Trading account profits and commissions increased $115 million on a sequential quarter basis. The largest driver was a $64 million mark-to-market differential, net of hedges, on the Company's index-linked certificates of deposit carried at fair value; a $5 million gain was recognized on this item in the fourth quarter compared to a $59 million loss in the third quarter. Additionally, a $16 million mark-to-market valuation gain, net of hedges, was recognized in the current quarter on the Company's public debt carried at fair value, compared to a valuation loss of $22 million in the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, trading account profits and commissions increased $124 million. This was largely driven by a $54 million increase, net of hedges, from the prior year in mark-to-market valuation gains on the Company's public debt carried at fair value. An approximate $30 million of the increase was due to lower valuation losses on previously securitized and sold loans, and the net impact of gains on the sale of, and improved market valuations on, assets carried at fair value.
Consumer and commercial fee-based income in the fourth quarter of 2010 were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter and fourth quarter of 2009, as strong investment banking income and card fees were offset by lower service charges on deposits as a result of recently enacted regulations. Other income in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $13 million gain recognized upon the previously-announced sale of the Company's money market mutual fund business.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, noninterest income was essentially flat compared to 2009. Trading account profits and commissions increased as a result of reduced valuation losses, net of hedges, on the Company's public debt carried at fair value. This was offset by lower mortgage-related income and service charges on deposit accounts.
Noninterest Expense
For the fourth quarter of 2010, noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $49 million, or 3%, on a sequential quarter basis, and an increase of $95 million, or 7%, over the fourth quarter of 2009. The expense increase relative to both periods was primarily due to investments that are expected to enhance future revenue generation capabilities. Employee compensation and benefits increased $29 million from the sequential quarter and $44 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was driven by higher salaries, mostly due to additional full-time equivalent employees  which increased by 458 and 1,055 over the sequential quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively  primarily in the mortgage, technology, and client support areas. Additionally, higher incentive compensation related to improved financial performance in certain business lines contributed to the increase. Outside processing and software expense increased $17 million compared to the third quarter and $25 million over the prior year quarter due to increased expenses associated with client acquisition and risk management technology projects and higher transaction volumes. Marketing and customer development expenses increased $13 million, or 30%, on a sequential quarter basis, and $8 million, or 17%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Credit-related costs were $189 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, up $8 million compared to the third quarter and $15 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by higher other real estate losses. The current quarter included $4 million in net losses on the extinguishment of debt compared to $12 million in the third quarter and $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Total noninterest expense was $5.9 billion in 2010, a decrease of $651 million, or 10%, compared to 2009, which included a $751 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2009. Personnel-related expenses increased $21 million, or 1%, due to increased full time-equivalent employees partially offset by lower pension cost. Outside processing and software expenses increased $59 million, or 10%, related to technology investments made to enhance the client experience, as well as increased transaction volumes. Marketing and customer development expenses increased $25 million, or 16%, due to increased advertising and other expenses aimed at driving deposit growth. FDIC insurance premiums declined $37 million, primarily due to the special assessment paid in 2009. Credit-related costs were down $28 million as higher other real estate losses were offset by lower mortgage reinsurance losses. Debt extinguishment costs increased $31 million over 2009.
Income Taxes
For the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $45 million compared to a benefit of $263 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 19.7%. For the year, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes of $185 million compared to a benefit of $898 million in 2009.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
For the fourth quarter and full years of 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $67 million, $267 million, and $266 million, respectively, in preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in preferred securities issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The 5.5% effective yield reflects the 5.0% dividend rate and the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred stock at issuance.
Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 2010, SunTrust had total assets of $172.9 billion and shareholders' equity of $23.1 billion, representing 13.4% of total assets. Book and tangible book value per common share were $36.34 and $23.76, respectively, as of December 31, 2010.
Loans
Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $114.9 billion, up $1.6 billion, or 1%, compared to the third quarter. Growth in average commercial, residential mortgage, and consumer loans was partially offset by declines in construction and commercial real estate loans. During the fourth quarter, the Company completed an approximately $900 million purchase of high-quality indirect auto loans. Average loans for the fourth quarter of 2010 were essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009; however, the mix of loans changed over this time. The Company reduced its outstanding exposure to construction, home equity, and commercial real estate loans by a combined $4.0 billion, or 11%. Meanwhile, the outstanding balances in consumer direct (primarily student loans) and indirect auto increased by a combined $3.5 billion, or 30%. The preponderance of the growth in 2010 within residential mortgage and student loans came in loans carrying a government guarantee, also helping to reduce the overall risk profile of the loan portfolio. During the current quarter, loan originations including renewals and loan commitments totaled $22.2 billion, up 13% over the prior quarter.
 
Deposits
Consumer and commercial deposits in the fourth quarter of 2010 averaged $119.7 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 2%, compared to the prior quarter. Growth was driven by lower-cost accounts, including demand, NOW, and money market. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, average consumer and commercial deposits increased $2.7 billion, or 2%. This growth was also driven by the lower-cost accounts, which grew a combined $8.5 billion, or 10%. Higher-cost consumer and other time deposits declined $6.0 billion, or 22%. While changing client preferences and the economic environment have contributed to this favorable shift in the deposit mix, SunTrust also attributes the growth to its investments in enhancing the client experience and its marketing initiatives. Among other benefits, the growth in low-cost deposits has enabled reductions in wholesale funding sources, including brokered and foreign deposit declines of $2.3 billion, or 45%.
Capital and Liquidity
The estimated Tier 1 common, Tier 1 capital, and tangible equity to tangible asset ratios remained relatively consistent compared to the prior quarter at 8.1%, 13.7%, and 10.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The estimated Tier 1 capital ratio excluding the TARP preferred stock was 10.0% at year-end. The Company's capital position remains strong relative to current regulatory requirements. Its Tier 1 common ratio also exceeds the guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Company continues to have substantial liquidity as the inflows of deposits have largely been retained in cash or invested in high quality government-backed securities. In addition, the Company continues to have significant available borrowing capacity from its contingent funding sources.
Asset Quality
Asset quality metrics continued to improve during the quarter. Nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, early stage delinquencies, and net charge-offs declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was $3.0 billion, a decline of $112 million from the prior quarter. The reduction in the allowance for loan losses, combined with $920 million of growth in period-end total loans, resulted in a decline in the allowance to total loans ratio of 11 basis points to 2.58%. At the end of 2010, approximately 7.5% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans. The reserve for unfunded commitments increased $3 million sequentially to $58 million. Early stage delinquencies were 1.18% as of year-end, a modest improvement of 6 basis points from the end of the third quarter.
Net charge-off trends continued to improve, with fourth quarter net charge-offs of $621 million being less than the levels recognized in each of the previous six quarters. On a sequential basis, net charge-offs declined $69 million. Construction and residential mortgage net charge-offs declined $102 million, while commercial loan charge-offs increased $29 million; net charge-offs for all other loan categories were relatively flat. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net charge-offs declined $200 million with declines in all loan categories except for commercial real estate, which increased to $38 million from $3 million. For the current quarter, the ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 2.14%, down 28 basis points and 69 basis points from the prior quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the current quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter and down $462 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. For the year, net charge-offs were $2.9 billion, down $384 million compared to 2009, while the provision for credit losses declined $1.4 billion.
Nonaccrual loans declined $263 million, or 6%, from the prior quarter, continuing the downward trend experienced since the third quarter of 2009. The overall decline during the quarter in nonaccrual loans was mainly attributable to reductions in construction, residential mortgage, and commercial loans, while nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased $43 million, or 9%. Nonaccrual loans totaled $4.1
 
billion, down $1.3 billion, or 24%, from the prior year. Residential mortgage and construction nonaccrual loans declined $857 million, or 32%, and $356 million, or 24%, respectively. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, nonaccrual loans represented 3.54% of total loans, down 121 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 and down 26 basis points from the prior quarter. Repayments, charge-offs, transfers to other real estate owned, and reduced inflows to nonaccrual status contributed to the overall decline. As of December 31, 2010, other real estate owned totaled $596 million, down $49 million since the prior quarter end.
The Company continued its efforts to assist borrowers experiencing financial difficulties through loan modifications. Accruing restructured loans increased during the quarter by $97 million and totaled $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2010. Compared to December 31, 2009, accruing restructured loans increased $972 million. Nonaccruing restructured loans remained relatively stable at $1.0 billion. The vast majority of accruing restructured loans relate to consumers, primarily residential mortgages. Nonaccruing restructured loans are also primarily related to consumers but also include $324 million of loans to business clients.

This news release includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrust's performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided within or in the appendix to this news release. In this news release, the Company presents net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis, and ratios on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.
This news release may contain forward-looking statements. Statements regarding future levels of net interest margin, future levels of and rates of change in delinquencies, future levels of nonperforming loans and charge-offs, the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts, is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "targets," "initiatives," "potentially," "potential impacts," "probably," "projects," "outlook" or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "should," "would," and "could." Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Such statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the statements made herein or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events.
Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our 10-K and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: our expense for regulatory assessment may increase as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act; difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; recent levels of market volatility are unprecedented; we are subject to capital adequacy guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; recently enacted legislation, or legislation enacted in the future, or any proposed federal programs subject us to increased regulation and may adversely affect us; we have not yet received permission to repay TARP funds; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to credit risk; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material
 
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; we are subject to certain risks from originating, selling, and holding mortgages, including the risk that we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, and the risk of delays in the foreclosure process, both of which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins; future legislation could harm our competitive position; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; significant legal actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities; recently declining values of real estate, increases in unemployment, and the related effects on local economies may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results; deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us; our allowance for loans and lease losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; in 2009 and 2010, credit rating agencies downgraded the credit ratings of SunTrust Bank and SunTrust Banks, Inc., and these downgrades and any subsequent downgrades could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities and could have an impact on our businesses and results of operations; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

SunTrust presents noninterest expense, net income/(loss), net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, and net income/(loss) per average common diluted share that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charges provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measures also allow better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, management uses the measures internally to analyze performance.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiary's federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiary's income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.
