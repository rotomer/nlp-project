5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangement of Certain Directors.
Following the repayment by SunTrust Banks, Inc. ("SunTrust" or the "Company") of the United States Treasury's TARP investment in the Company, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of SunTrust (the "Committee") approved a revised compensation structure for the Company's named executive officers. The new structure continues the Company's practice of benchmarking pay to the median of peer practices, but the repayment of TARP provides the Committee greater flexibility in structuring the components of compensation and permits it to increase the portion of compensation that is dependent upon Company performance.
Specifically, the Committee approved long-term incentive opportunities which include performance vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, as summarized in the table below. The Committee determined the amount of both total direct compensation (salary, annual incentive, and long-term incentive) and the long-term incentive by reference to the median of peer practice. Approximately half of the long-term incentive will consist of RSUs, the vesting of which is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group consisting of the banks which comprise the KBW Bank Sector Index. The remainder of the long-term incentive will consist of approximately half RSUs, the vesting of which is tied to the achievement of a Tier 1 capital financial target, and stock options. As a result, a total of approximately 75% of the long-term incentive will now be tied to Company performance.
 
 
Approximately 50% of the long-term incentive will be delivered via performance-vested RSUs which vest based upon the Company's TSR measured over three years relative to the TSR of the companies which comprise the KBW Bank Sector Index, a commonly available index which consists of 24 banking companies (excluding SunTrust). The figures in the above table represent the amount of the award which will vest upon target performance, or a TSR equal to the 50
Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Units  Total Shareholder Return.
th
percentile of peer group performance. Performance below the minimum performance level, or 25
th
percentile, will result in no vesting. Performance at the minimum performance level, or 25
th
percentile, will result in vesting of 50% of the award. Performance at the 75
th
percentile will result in vesting at 150%, and performance equal to the maximum performance level, or 90
th
percentile, will result in vesting at 200%. Straight-line interpolation will be used to determine the number of shares which vest as a result of performance in between the 25
th
and 90
th
percentiles. Awards will be denominated in and settled in shares of SunTrust common stock. Dividends will not be paid on unvested awards but instead will be accrued and reinvested in equivalent shares of SunTrust common stock and paid if and when the underlying award vests.
Approximately 25% of the long-term incentive will be delivered via performance-vested RSUs which vest based upon achievement of a Tier 1 capital goal measured at December 31, 2011. Tier 1 capital is a classification of equity capital used by the Company's banking regulators.
Performance-Vested Restricted Stock Units  Tier 1 Capital.
Failure to satisfy such performance vesting condition will result in the forfeiture of the entire award. Awards will be denominated in and settled in shares of SunTrust common stock. Dividends will not be paid on unvested awards but instead will be accrued and reinvested in equivalent shares of SunTrust common stock.
Approximately 25% of the long-term incentive will be delivered via stock options which shall vest pro rata annually over three years (i.e. one-third each year).
Stock Options.
The TSR performance-vested RSU award cliff vests after three years (i.e. does not vest at all until after three years). The Tier 1 capital performance-vested RSU award and the Stock Option award vest pro rata annually over three years (i.e. one-third each year).
Special Vesting Provisions.
Each award may vest early upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events. The vesting of all of the awards accelerates upon the participant's death or disability. Upon a change in control, the Tier 1 capital performance-vested RSU award and the Stock Option award completely vest, and a portion of the TSR performance-vested RSU vests based on actual performance through the date of the change in control and the other portion of such award will vest based on target performance for the period from the date of the change in control through the vesting date. All awards also vest early on a pro rata basis upon an involuntary termination of employment due to a reduction in force. Awards made to retirement-eligible individuals remain subject to forfeiture during the normal vesting and/or performance period set forth in the award after retirement if the participant fails to perform non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disclosure, non-pirating, and non-disparagement covenants included within each award agreement. Half of the net shares which vest under all awards will be subject to additional 1-year holding periods.
The Committee did not increase base salaries paid in cash. This was the third consecutive year without any base salary increases (other than in cases of promotions or increased responsibility). The Committee also eliminated salary paid in stock (sometimes referred to as salary shares).
Base Salaries.
The compensation structure will also include an annual incentive opportunity under the Company's existing Management Incentive Plan (MIP) consistent with pre-TARP practices, except that the MIP opportunity for the current year will be reduced pro rata by the portion of the year in which TARP was outstanding. Payments under the MIP to the named executive officers are contingent upon achievement of annual corporate financial goals. The Company did not pay an annual incentive to any of its named executive officers for 2010, 2009 or 2008.
Annual Incentive.

 3. PERFORMANCE BASED VESTING. The Grantee shall vest in a percentage of Restricted Stock Units (between 0% and 200%) corresponding to SunTrust's attainment of the Performance Level, as set forth in the table below, on March 31, 2014 (the "Vesting Date"); provided, that the Grantee has remained in continuous employment with SunTrust or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date through the Vesting Date, except as provided in  5(d) hereof (pertaining to vesting after Retirement). In addition, the Restricted Stock Units may vest prior to the Vesting Date in accordance with any other provisions of  4 or  5.
The percentage of Restricted Stock Units that vest if SunTrust's TSR Percentile on the Vesting Date is between the "Minimum" and "Target" or between the "Target" and "Maximum" Performance Levels shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Committee shall determine the number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that shall vest by multiplying the "Percentage of Restricted Stock Units That Vest," set forth above, by the number of Restricted Stock Units granted under this Unit Agreement.
 4. ACCELERATED VESTING: SUNTRUST CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event that a Change in Control (as defined in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan) occurs prior to the Vesting Date and on or prior to any vesting date set forth in  5, upon the earlier of: (a) the Vesting Date, provided that the Grantee has remained in continuous employment with SunTrust or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date through the Vesting Date; or (b) the date of the Grantee's termination of employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries as a result of: (i) an involuntary termination by SunTrust that does not result from the Grantee's death or Disability and does not constitute a Termination for Cause; (ii) the Grantee's death or Disability; or (iii) a voluntary termination by the Grantee as a result of Retirement or a Termination for Good Reason, the following number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall vest: (A) the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested (if any) if the Performance Period ended on the date of the Change in Control (based on the actual Performance Level achieved through the date of the Change in Control) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the first day of the Performance Period through the date of such Change in Control, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the original Performance Period; plus (B) the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested assuming SunTrust's achievement of the Target Performance Level multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the date of such Change in Control through the last day of the original Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in the original Performance Period. In the event of such Change in Control, any Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement that do not vest pursuant to this  4 shall terminate and be completely forfeited on the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment or, if earlier, the Vesting Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Grantee is subject to the terms of a Change in Control Agreement on the date of a Change in Control that provides for more generous vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, such vesting provisions of the Change in Control Agreement shall govern.
 5. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
(a) If prior to the Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than those described in  5(b),  5(c) or  5(d), then the Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement shall terminate and be completely forfeited on the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment. Notwithstanding anything in this  5 to the contrary, if the Grantee is Terminated for Cause from SunTrust and its Subsidiaries prior to payment pursuant to  6, all of the Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) will immediately and automatically without any action on the part of the Grantee or SunTrust, be forfeited by the Grantee.
(b) If the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries terminates prior to the Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, as a result of the Grantee's (i) death, or (ii) Disability, then Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) may vest immediately on the date of such termination. The number of Restricted Stock Units, if any, that vest will be based on the number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that would have vested (if any) if the Performance Period ended on such date (based on the actual Performance Level achieved (or the Target Performance Level, if such termination occurs less than one (1) year after the first day of the Performance Period)). In the event of such termination, any Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent
Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement that do not vest pursuant to this  5(b) shall terminate and be completely forfeited on such date.
(c) If the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated prior to the Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, by reason of a reduction in force which results in the Grantee's eligibility for payment of a severance benefit pursuant to the terms of the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Severance Pay Plan or any successor to such plan, then a pro-rata number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall vest on the last day of the Performance Period, if any, based on the Grantee's service completed from the first day of the Performance Period through the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment. The pro-rata number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) vesting shall equal the product of: (i) the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested based on the actual Performance Level achieved as of the Vesting Date; multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from the first day of the Performance Period through the date of such termination of employment, and the denominator of which is equal to the number of days in the Performance Period. In the event of such pro-rata vesting described above, any Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement that do not vest pursuant to this  5(c) shall terminate and be completely forfeited on such date.
(d) If the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries terminates prior to the Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, as a result of the Grantee's Retirement, then the number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that would have vested based on the actual Performance Level achieved as of the Vesting Date in accordance with  3 shall, subject to  7(d) below, be fully vested on the last day of the Performance Period.
 6. PAYMENT OF AWARD.
(a) The number of vested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) payable pursuant to this  6 (the "Vested Units") shall be determined in accordance with  3,  4 and  5 above and shall be paid in a lump sum upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the date of the Grantee's death, (ii) the date of the Grantee's Disability, (iii) the date of the Grantee's Separation from Service within two (2) years following a 409A Change in Control, or (iv) April 2014. In the event payment is made pursuant to sub-paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) above, such payment shall be made on the last day of the sixty (60) day period which commences immediately following the date of the applicable event. Except as set forth below, the Vested Units shall be paid out in an equivalent number of shares of Stock; provided, however, the Grantee's right to any fractional share of Stock shall be paid in cash. In the event the Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) vest following a Change in Control pursuant to  4, the Vested Units shall be paid in cash, and the amount of the payment for each Vested Unit to be paid in cash will equal the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of the Change in Control.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, distributions may not be made to a Key Employee upon a Separation from Service before the date which is six (6) months after the date of the Key Employee's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Key Employee). Any payments that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be accumulated and paid in the seventh month following the Grantee's Separation from Service.
(b) The Grantee shall be entitled to a Dividend Equivalent Right for each Vested Unit. At the same time that the Vested Units are paid, SunTrust shall pay each Dividend Equivalent Right in shares of Stock to the Grantee, or, in the event the Restricted Stock Units vest pursuant to  4, in cash; provided, however, the Grantee's right to any fractional share of Stock shall be paid in cash.
(c) The Grantee will not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, including the right to vote or receive dividends, unless and until shares of Stock are issued to the Grantee as payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units.
 7. COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
(a) By accepting the Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee agrees not to sell Stock at a time when applicable laws or SunTrust's rules prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as the Grantee is an employee, consultant or director of SunTrust or a Subsidiary of SunTrust. Upon receipt of nonforfeitable shares of Stock pursuant to this Unit Agreement, the Grantee agrees, if so requested by SunTrust, to hold such shares for investment and not with a view of resale or distribution to the public, and if requested by SunTrust, the Grantee must deliver to SunTrust a written statement satisfactory to SunTrust to that effect. The Committee may refuse to issue any shares of Stock to the Grantee for which the Grantee refuses to provide an appropriate statement.
(b) To the extent that the Grantee does not vest in any Restricted Stock Units, all interest in such units, the related shares of Stock, and any Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be forfeited. The Grantee shall have no right or interest in any Restricted Stock Unit or related share of Stock that is forfeited.
(c) Upon each issuance or transfer of shares of Stock in accordance with this Unit Agreement, a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the number of shares of Stock issued or transferred to the Grantee shall be extinguished and such number of Restricted Stock Units will not be considered to be held by the Grantee for any purpose.
(d) In the event of a Grantee's Retirement, such Grantee must fully perform the following covenants from the date of such termination through March 31, 2014:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Failure of a Grantee subject to this  7(d) to fully perform the covenants set forth above will result in a forfeiture of all unpaid Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) under this Unit Agreement as of the date of such failure. Such forfeiture will be in compliance with Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(f).
 8. WITHHOLDING.
(a) Upon the payment of any Restricted Stock Units, SunTrust's obligation to deliver shares of Stock or cash to settle the Vested Units and Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be subject to the satisfaction of applicable tax withholding requirements, including federal, state, and local requirements. The Grantee must pay to SunTrust any applicable federal, state or local withholding tax due as a result of such payment.
(b) The Committee shall have the right to reduce the number of shares of Stock issued to the Grantee to satisfy the minimum applicable tax withholding requirements.
 9. NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan or this Unit Agreement or any related material shall give the Grantee the right to continue in the employment of SunTrust or any Subsidiary or adversely affect the right of SunTrust or any Subsidiary to terminate the Grantee's employment with or without cause at any time.
 10. OTHER LAWS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SunTrust shall have the right to refuse to pay any cash award or to issue or transfer any shares under this Unit Agreement if SunTrust acting in its absolute discretion determines that such payment or issuance or transfer of such Stock might violate any applicable law or regulation.
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
(a) This Unit Agreement shall be subject to all of the provisions, definitions, terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and any interpretations, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time, all of which are incorporated by reference in this Unit Agreement.
(b) The Plan and this Unit Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia (without regard to its choice-of-law provisions).
(c) No rights granted under the Plan or this Unit Agreement and no Restricted Stock Units shall be deemed transferable by the Grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution prior to the time the Grantee's interest in such units has become fully vested.
(d) Any written notices provided for in this Unit Agreement that are sent by mail shall be deemed received three (3) business days after mailing, but not later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to the Grantee, at the Grantee's address indicated by SunTrust's records and, if to SunTrust, at SunTrust's principal executive office.
(e) If one or more of the provisions of this Unit Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed null and void; however, to the
extent permissible by law, any provisions which could be deemed null and void shall first be construed, interpreted or revised retroactively to permit this Unit Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent of this Unit Agreement and the Plan.
(f) This Unit Agreement (which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Plan) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Unit Agreement supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, understandings, commitments and agreements with respect to such matters.
(g) The Restricted Stock Units are intended to comply with Code Section 409A and official guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Unit Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with this intention.

 4. ACCELERATED VESTING: SUNTRUST CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event that a Change in Control (as defined in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan) occurs prior to a Vesting Date and on or prior to any vesting date set forth in  5, then any unvested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall be fully vested upon the earlier of: (a) each respective Vesting Date, provided that the Grantee has remained in continuous employment with SunTrust or a Subsidiary from the Grant Date through the Vesting Dates, or (b) the date of the Grantee's termination of employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries as a result of: (i) an involuntary termination by SunTrust that does not result from the Grantee's death or Disability and does not constitute a Termination for Cause, (ii) a voluntary termination by the Grantee as a result of Retirement or a Termination for Good Reason; or (iii) the Grantee's death or Disability.
In the event of such Change in Control, any Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement that do not vest pursuant to this  4 shall terminate and be completely forfeited on the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Grantee is subject to the terms of a Change in Control Agreement on the date of a Change in Control that provides for more generous vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, such vesting provisions of the Change in Control Agreement shall govern.
 5. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.
(a) If prior to a Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than those described in  5(b),  5(c) or  5(d), then the unvested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement shall terminate and be completely forfeited on the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment. Notwithstanding anything in this  5 to the contrary, if the Grantee is Terminated for Cause from SunTrust and its Subsidiaries prior to payment pursuant to  6, all of the Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) will immediately and automatically without any action on the part of the Grantee or SunTrust, be forfeited by the Grantee.
(b) If the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries terminates prior to a Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, as a result of the Grantee's (i) death, or (ii) Disability, then the unvested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall be fully vested immediately on the date of such termination.
(c) If the Grantee's employment with SunTrust and its Subsidiaries is involuntarily terminated prior to a Vesting Date and the date of a Change in Control, by reason of a reduction in force which results in the Grantee's eligibility for payment of a severance benefit pursuant to the terms of the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Severance Pay Plan or any successor
to such plan, if the Tier 1 Capital Ratio requirement in  3 above is satisfied, a pro-rata number of unvested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall be vested, if any, based on the Grantee's service completed from the first day of the Performance Period through the date of such termination of the Grantee's employment. The pro-rata number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) vesting shall equal the difference between (i) the number of shares determined by multiplying: (1) the total number of Restricted Stock Units subject to this Unit Agreement; by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from the Grant Date through the date of such termination, and the denominator of which is equal to the number of days from the Grant Date through the final Vesting Date listed in  3; and (ii) the number of shares that have vested on or prior to the date of such termination. In the event of such pro-rata vesting described above, any Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement that do not vest pursuant to this  5(c) shall terminate and be completely forfeited on such date.
then
(d) If the Tier 1 Capital Ratio requirement in  3 above is satisfied and a Grantee is or becomes eligible for Retirement on or after the Grant Date, such Grantee shall, subject to  7(d) below, be fully vested in his unvested Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to this Unit Agreement upon the later of the last day of the Performance Period or the date the Grantee becomes eligible for Retirement.
 6. PAYMENT OF AWARD.
(a) Subject to  6(b), the total number of Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) which vest, if any, in accordance with  3,  4, or  5 of this Agreement (the "Vested Units") shall be paid in a lump sum on the specified dates, as follows:
 
 
 
(b) Notwithstanding the specified dates set forth in  6(a), the total number of Vested Units shall be paid in a lump sum upon the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the date of the Grantee's death, (ii) the date of the Grantee's Disability, or (iii) if prior to the date a Grantee becomes eligible for Retirement, the date of the Grantee's Separation from Service. In the event payment is made pursuant to sub-paragraph (i), (ii) or (iii) above, such payment shall be made on the last day of the sixty (60) day period which commences immediately following the date of the applicable event. Except as set forth below, the Vested Units shall be paid out in an equivalent number of shares of Stock; provided, however, the Grantee's right to any fractional share of Stock shall be paid in cash. In the event the Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) vest following a Change in Control pursuant to  4, the Vested Units shall be paid in cash, and the amount of the payment for each Vested Unit to be paid in cash will equal the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, distributions may not be made to a Key Employee upon a Separation from Service before the date which is six (6) months after the date of the Key Employee's Separation from Service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the Key Employee). Any payments that would otherwise be made during this period of delay shall be accumulated and paid in the seventh month following the Grantee's Separation from Service.
(c) The Grantee shall be entitled to a Dividend Equivalent Right for each Vested Unit. At the same time that the Vested Units are paid, SunTrust shall pay each Dividend Equivalent Right in shares of Stock to the Grantee, or, in the event the Restricted Stock Units vest pursuant to  4, in cash; provided, however, the Grantee's right to any fractional share of Stock shall be paid in cash.
(d) The Grantee will not have any shareholder rights with respect to the Restricted Stock Units, including the right to vote or receive dividends, unless and until shares of Stock are issued to the Grantee as payment of the vested Restricted Stock Units.
 7. COVENANTS, RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
(a) By accepting the Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee agrees not to sell Stock at a time when applicable laws or SunTrust's rules prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as the Grantee is an employee, consultant or director of SunTrust or a Subsidiary of SunTrust. Upon receipt of nonforfeitable shares of Stock pursuant to this Unit Agreement, the Grantee agrees, if so requested by SunTrust, to hold such shares for investment and not with a view of resale or distribution to the public, and if requested by SunTrust, the Grantee must deliver to SunTrust a written statement satisfactory to SunTrust to that effect. The Committee may refuse to issue any shares of Stock to the Grantee for which the Grantee refuses to provide an appropriate statement.
(b) To the extent that the Grantee does not vest in any Restricted Stock Units, all interest in such units, the related shares of Stock, and any Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be forfeited. The Grantee shall have no right or interest in any Restricted Stock Unit or related share of Stock that is forfeited.
(c) Upon each issuance or transfer of shares of Stock in accordance with this Unit Agreement, a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the number of shares of Stock issued or transferred to the Grantee shall be extinguished and such number of Restricted Stock Units will not be considered to be held by the Grantee for any purpose.
(d) In the event of a Grantee's Retirement, such Grantee must fully perform the following covenants from the date of such termination through March 31, 2014:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Failure of a Grantee subject to this  7(d) to fully perform the covenants set forth above will result in a forfeiture of all unpaid Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) under this Unit Agreement as of the date of such failure. Such forfeiture will be in compliance with Treas. Reg.  1.409A-3(f).
 8. WITHHOLDING.
(a) Upon the payment of any Restricted Stock Units, SunTrust's obligation to deliver shares of Stock or cash to settle the Vested Units and Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be subject to the satisfaction of applicable tax withholding requirements, including federal, state, and local requirements. The Grantee must pay to SunTrust any applicable federal, state or local withholding tax due as a result of such payment.
(b) The Committee shall have the right to reduce the number of shares of Stock issued to the Grantee to satisfy the minimum applicable tax withholding requirements.
 9. NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. Nothing in the Plan or this Unit Agreement or any related material shall give the Grantee the right to continue in the employment of SunTrust or any Subsidiary or adversely affect the right of SunTrust or any Subsidiary to terminate the Grantee's employment with or without cause at any time.
 10. OTHER LAWS. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SunTrust shall have the right to refuse to pay any cash award or to issue or transfer any shares under this Unit Agreement if SunTrust acting in its absolute discretion determines that such payment or issuance or transfer of such Stock might violate any applicable law or regulation.
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
(a) This Unit Agreement shall be subject to all of the provisions, definitions, terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and any interpretations, rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee from time to time, all of which are incorporated by reference in this Unit Agreement.
(b) The Plan and this Unit Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia (without regard to its choice-of-law provisions).
(c) No rights granted under the Plan or this Unit Agreement and no Restricted Stock Units shall be deemed transferable by the Grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution prior to the time the Grantee's interest in such units has become fully vested.
(d) Any written notices provided for in this Unit Agreement that are sent by mail shall be deemed received three (3) business days after mailing, but not later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to the Grantee, at the Grantee's address indicated by SunTrust's records and, if to SunTrust, at SunTrust's principal executive office.
(e) If one or more of the provisions of this Unit Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed null and void; however, to the
extent permissible by law, any provisions which could be deemed null and void shall first be construed, interpreted or revised retroactively to permit this Unit Agreement to be construed so as to foster the intent of this Unit Agreement and the Plan.
(f) This Unit Agreement (which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Plan) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Unit Agreement supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, understandings, commitments and agreements with respect to such matters.
(g) The Restricted Stock Units are intended to comply with Code Section 409A and official guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Unit Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with this intention.
