For Immediate Release

ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income per average common share of $0.08 for the first quarter of 2011, or $0.22 excluding the $0.14 non-cash charge related to the redemption of the TARP preferred shares issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. Excluding this charge, earnings were essentially flat compared to the $0.23 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. This quarter's performance was driven by further improvement in credit quality, expansion of the net interest margin and a reduction in expenses. These results were achieved despite seasonal and cyclical factors adversely impacting first quarter results. Results compare favorably to a net loss of $0.46 per average common share reported for the first quarter of 2010. Net income available to common shareholders was $38 million for the first quarter of 2011, or $112 million excluding the $74 million non-cash charge related to the redemption of the TARP preferred shares.
"Our emphasis on profitable growth and continued credit quality improvement resulted in solid performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter," said James M. Wells III, chairman and chief executive officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc. Mr. Wells noted that the Company's patient and deliberate approach to TARP redemption had been completed with the best interests of shareholders in mind, and that SunTrust is now "singularly focused on client-centric strategies to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our markets and further improve profitability."

Consolidated Financial Performance
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was $2,160 million for the first quarter of 2011 compared with $2,326 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $1,900 million for the first quarter of 2010. The 7% decline on a sequential quarter basis was primarily in noninterest income and due to lower mortgage production, declines in investment banking, and reduced mark-to-market valuation gains on the Company's debt carried at fair value, net of related hedges. The 14% total revenue increase from the prior year was driven by reduced interest expense, due primarily to strong low-cost deposit growth, and broad-based increases in consumer and commercial fee categories. Both the current quarter and the fourth quarter of 2010 included net gains of $64 million from the sales of securities compared with net gains of $1 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Net Interest Income
For the first quarter of 2011, net interest income was $1,277 million compared with $1,294 million in the prior quarter and $1,202 million in the prior year. The $17 million, or 1%, decline on a sequential quarter basis was primarily related to two fewer days in the current quarter. The 6% increase in net interest income over the first quarter of 2010 was attributable to lower deposit rates, continued deposit growth, and the shift in deposit mix toward low-cost deposits, thereby enabling a decline in higher-cost wholesale funding. Interest earning asset yields were relatively stable, despite the lower interest rate environment, due to active management of the balance sheet and improved loan pricing.
Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2011 was 3.53% compared with 3.44% in the prior quarter and 3.32% in the prior year. The 9 basis point increase on a sequential quarter basis was driven by higher rates on average earning assets, primarily related to a reduction in lower-yielding securities available for sale, and favorable changes in deposit mix. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, the 21 basis point increase was primarily driven by a 31 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which more than offset a 6 basis point decline in earning asset yields.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $883 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $1,032 million in the prior quarter and $698 million in the prior year. The $149 million, or 14%, sequential quarter decline was primarily driven by lower mortgage production related income, investment banking revenue, and mark-to-market valuation gains. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, noninterest income increased $185 million, or 27%, due to broad-based growth in consumer and commercial fee-based categories and higher net gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts.
Mortgage production and servicing income was a combined $71 million in the current quarter compared with $109 million in the prior quarter and $39 million in the prior year. The $38 million, or 35%, decline on a sequential quarter basis was due to lower mortgage production volume in light of the negative impact that higher mortgage interest rates had on refinance activity, as well as reduced gain on sale margins. The $32 million increase in mortgage income from the prior year was primarily due to a $48 million decline in mortgage repurchase costs. The repurchase cost was $80 million in the current quarter, and reserves for mortgage repurchase losses were $270 million as of March 31, 2011, an increase of $5 million over December 31, 2010. The reserve increase was primarily due to recent increases in agency-related repurchase requests. Mortgage servicing income was essentially flat compared to the prior quarter and prior year. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $164.4 billion as of March 31, 2011, compared to $167.2 billion at December 31, 2010.
 
Trading account profits and commissions were $52 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $93 million in the prior quarter and ($7) million in the prior year. Core capital markets-related trading income remained stable on a sequential quarter basis and was up slightly year-over-year. The $41 million sequential quarter decline was driven by $31 million in valuation related losses, net of hedges, on the Company's index-linked CDs and public debt, both carried at fair value. This compares with valuation gains of $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. The net $52 million change was the result of the Company's credit spread improving during the current quarter. Partially offsetting these debt-related mark-to-market losses was an incremental $11 million in valuation gains on illiquid securities. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, trading account profits and commissions increased $59 million driven by a $20 million decrease in valuation losses, net of hedges, on the Company's index-linked CDs and public debt, both carried at fair value, as well as more favorable valuation impacts of approximately $46 million on illiquid securities.
Investment banking income was $67 million in the current quarter compared with $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $56 million in the first quarter of 2010. The $36 million sequential quarter decline was attributable to high levels of syndicated finance deal flow in the fourth quarter and a typical seasonal decline in investment banking during the first quarter. The $11 million increase from the prior year was due to higher levels of syndicated finance income.
Service charges on deposit accounts declined on a year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, primarily due to overdraft fees, as clients altered their behavior, including responding to regulatory-induced product changes. Conversely, trust income, retail investment income, and card fees all increased on both a sequential quarter and prior year comparison. Net gains on the sale of securities associated with repositioning the investment portfolio were $64 million in the current quarter and the fourth quarter of 2010 and $1 million in the first quarter of 2010. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $13 million gain recognized upon the sale of the Company's money market mutual fund business.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was $1,465 million in the current quarter compared with $1,548 million in the prior quarter and $1,361 million in the prior year. The decrease of $83 million, or 5%, on a sequential quarter basis was the result of anticipated reductions in marketing and technology expenses, following specific investment-related expenses incurred during the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition, credit-related expenses declined $34 million, or 18%, driven by lower other real estate expenses and credit and collections expenses. Personnel related expenses increased only $16 million, or 2%, despite seasonally higher 401(k) and payroll taxes in the current quarter, as other staff expenses declined. Total full-time equivalent employees were flat compared to the beginning of the quarter.
The increase in noninterest expense over the first quarter of 2010 was primarily driven by a $62 million increase in employee compensation and benefits attributable to a 3% increase in full-time equivalent employees and higher incentive compensation related to improved business performance. Credit-related expenses increased $12 million, or 8%, due to higher other real estate expenses. Outside processing and software expense increased $9 million, or 6%, due to investments in various risk management and client service-related technology projects. FDIC and regulatory expenses increased $7 million, or 11%, primarily due to increased deposit balances.
Income Taxes
In the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $33 million compared with a provision of $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a benefit of $194 million in the first quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 15.5%.
 
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
In the current and 2010 quarters, the Company recorded $66 million of preferred dividends related to the $4.85 billion in TARP preferred shares issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. In addition, in conjunction with the current quarter redemption of TARP preferred shares, the Company incurred a non-cash charge to net income available to common shareholders of $74 million, or $0.14 per common diluted share, related to the unamortized discount on the TARP preferred shares.
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2011, SunTrust had total assets of $170.8 billion and shareholders' equity of $19.2 billion, representing 11.3% of total assets. During the first quarter, common shareholders' equity was increased as a result of the issuance of $1.0 billion in common equity, while total shareholders' equity declined $3.9 billion as a result of the redemption of the $4.9 billion in TARP preferred shares. Book and tangible book value per common share were $35.49 and $23.79, respectively, as of March 31, 2011.
Loans
During the current quarter, average loans were $115.2 billion, which compares with average balances of $114.9 billion and $114.4 billion during the fourth and first quarters of 2010, respectively. The relatively flat sequential quarter balance is the net effect of growth in targeted portfolios being offset by declines in higher-risk categories. Consumer loans grew due to the acquisition of high-quality auto loans during the fourth quarter of 2010, while commercial & industrial loans also increased. Sequential quarter declines occurred in higher-risk segments of the portfolio, including commercial construction and certain other real estate-related categories.
Compared to the first quarter of 2010, average loans increased $0.7 billion, or less than 1%. Growth was driven by the acquisition of auto and student loans, as well as from organic growth in commercial & industrial and government-guaranteed residential loans. The growth was offset by reductions in commercial construction, non-guaranteed residential mortgages, and home equity products. The net effect of the growth and declines within these particular loan categories resulted in a continued improvement in the risk profile of the portfolio. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 8% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans.
Deposits
Consumer and commercial deposits in the first quarter of 2011 averaged $120.7 billion, which compares with average balances of $119.7 billion and $115.1 billion in the prior quarter and prior year, respectively. The sequential quarter increase of $1.0 billion, or 0.9%, was concentrated in all low-cost deposit categories, while time deposits continued to decline, resulting in continued improvement in the deposit mix.
The average balance growth compared to the first quarter of 2010 was $5.6 billion, or 5%. Growth was driven by low-cost deposits, primarily demand and money market accounts, which grew a combined $10.1 billion, or 17%, while time deposits declined $4.6 billion, or 19%. While changing client preferences and the economic environment have contributed to this favorable shift in deposit mix, SunTrust also attributes the low-cost deposit growth to its investments in enhancing the client experience, its marketing initiatives, and its growth in core households.
 
Capital and Liquidity
The Company enhanced the composition of its capital base in the first quarter via the issuance of $1.0 billion in common equity and the redemption of the $4.9 billion in TARP preferred shares. As a result, the estimated Tier 1 common equity ratio is expected to increase 92 bps to 9.00%. Due to the TARP preferred shares redemption, the Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios are expected to decline 267 and 264 basis points, respectively, compared to the prior quarter to 11.00% and 13.90%, respectively, as of March 31, 2011. The Company's capital position remains well above current regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Company also continues to have substantial liquidity, as the inflows of deposits have largely been retained in cash or invested in high quality government-backed securities. In addition, the Company continues to have significant available borrowing capacity from its contingent funding sources, and it completed a $1.0 billion issuance of senior debt during the first quarter.
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter with net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, other real estate owned, and early stage delinquencies all declining compared to the fourth and first quarters of 2010.
Net charge-offs were $571 million in the current quarter compared with $621 million in the prior quarter and $821 million in the prior year. The $50 million sequential decline was concentrated in commercial loans, while other loan categories were relatively flat. Compared to the first quarter of 2010, net charge-offs declined $250 million, or 30%, with declines in all loan segments. For the current quarter, the ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 2.01%, an improvement of 13 and 90 basis points from the prior quarter and the prior year, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the current quarter was $447 million, down $65 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and down $415 million from the first quarter of 2010.
Nonperforming loans declined for the seventh consecutive quarter and, as of March 31, 2011, they were $4.0 billion. This compares with $4.1 billion in the prior quarter and $5.2 billion the prior year. The $139 million, or 3%, sequential decline in nonperforming loans was attributable to reductions in commercial construction and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans. A portion of the decline is attributable to the transfer of $57 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans to loans held for sale, as the Company elected to actively market these loans for sale during the current quarter and intends to sell them during the second quarter. As a result of transferring these loans to held for sale, the Company recorded an incremental $10 million in charge-offs to reflect the lower of cost or market carrying value that is required for loans held for sale. The $1,214 million, or 23%, decline in nonperforming loans from the prior year is driven primarily by reductions in the commercial & industrial, commercial construction, residential mortgage, and residential construction loan classes. At the end of the current quarter, nonperforming loans represented 3.46% of total loans, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010 and down 109 basis points from the end of the first quarter of 2010. As of March 31, 2011, other real estate owned totaled $534 million, down $62 million since year end.
Early stage delinquencies were 1.15% at quarter end, a modest improvement of 3 basis points from year end. Excluding government-guaranteed student loans and Ginnie Mae insured repurchased mortgage loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.80%, a decline of 10 basis points from year-end and 24 basis points from the prior year.
As of March 31, 2011, the allowance for loan losses was $2.9 billion representing 2.49% of total loans, down 9 basis points from year end. The allowance for loan losses declined $120 million during the current quarter as a result of the improvement in asset quality.
 
Accruing and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2011, which was relatively stable compared to year end. $3.1 billion of restructured loans relate to residential mortgages, while $0.5 billion are loans to commercial clients.

The fully taxable-equivalent ("FTE") basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities. The foregoing numbers primarily reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the securities portfolio which includes the ownership by the Company of common shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company'core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss), excluding securities (gains)/losses and The Coca-Cola Company stock dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities (gains)/losses.
1
s
SunTrust believes that the return on average realized common shareholders' equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders' equity is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, excluding securities (gains)/losses and The Coca-Cola Company stock dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders' equity.
2
Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share a that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Company's performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
7
Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiary's federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiary's income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.
