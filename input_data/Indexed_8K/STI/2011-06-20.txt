Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
Explanatory Note This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment ("Amendment No. 1") to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by SunTrust Banks, Inc. (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2011 (the "Original 8-K") to update "Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders" in the Original 8-K regarding the results from the Companys 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 26, 2011 (the "2011 Annual Meeting"). The sole purpose of this Amendment No. 1 is to disclose the Companys decision regarding how frequently it will conduct a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers. No other changes have been made to the Original 8-K. Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders At the 2011 Annual Meeting, the Companys shareholders recommended, in a non-binding advisory vote, that the Company hold a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Companys named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement, on an annual basis. Accordingly, in light of this recommendation and other factors considered by the Companys Board of Directors (the "Board"), the Board has determined that the Company will hold a non-binding advisory vote on the Companys compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement on an annual basis until the Board of Directors otherwise determines that a different frequency for such advisory votes is in the best interest of the Company.
