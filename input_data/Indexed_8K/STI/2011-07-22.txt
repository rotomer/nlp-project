ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders of $174 million, or $0.33 per average common share, for the second quarter of 2011. These results compare favorably to the prior quarter's earnings of $0.08 per average common share, or $0.22 per share excluding the non-cash charge related to the redemption of the TARP preferred shares. Second quarter results improved significantly from a loss of $0.11 per share reported in the second quarter of 2010.
"Our earnings per share improvement continued this quarter," said William H. Rogers, Jr., SunTrust's president and chief executive officer. "While the economic recovery remains uneven, we continued to demonstrate meaningful improvements in asset quality. Additionally, our client-centric approach is driving even higher levels of loyalty and is increasingly evidencing itself in the form of enhanced performance by many of our businesses." Mr. Rogers also noted that the company is committed to even stronger performance in the future, including an increased focus on expense management.

Consolidated Financial Performance
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was $2,198 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $2,160 million in both the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010. Net gains from the sales of securities were $32 million in the current quarter compared to $64 million in the first quarter of 2011 and $57 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding these gains, revenue increased 3% on both a sequential quarter and a prior year basis. The growth from the first quarter of 2011 was due to higher fee income, most notably investment banking income. The increase compared to the prior year quarter was due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower deposit service charges.
For the six months ended June 30
th
, total revenue was $4,358 million in 2011 compared to $4,060 million for the prior year. The 7% increase was due to higher net interest income, growth in most consumer and commercial fee categories, and higher net gains from the sales of securities, partially offset by lower service charges due to the implementation of new regulatory requirements in the third quarter of 2010.
Net Interest Income
For the second quarter of 2011, net interest income was $1,286 million compared with $1,277 million in the prior quarter and $1,208 million in the prior year quarter. The 1% increase on a sequential quarter basis was mainly related to one more day in the current quarter. The 6% increase over the second quarter of 2010 was primarily attributable to lower rates paid on deposits, a continued shift in deposit mix toward lower-cost deposits, and a reduction in higher-cost funding.
Net interest margin for the second quarter of 2011 was 3.53%, consistent with the prior quarter and up 20 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, yields on earning assets declined five basis points, driven by lower loan yields, while rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined seven basis points, as rates paid on deposits and long-term debt costs declined. Compared to the prior year quarter, the favorable shift in the deposit mix, lower rates paid, and reduced long-term debt contributed to a decline in interest-bearing liabilities of 34 basis points, more than offsetting the nine basis point decline in earning asset yields, which were primarily loan-related.
For the six months ended June 30
th
, net interest income was $2,563 million in 2011 compared to $2,410 million in 2010, an increase of 6%. Net interest margin was 3.53% in 2011, up 21 basis points. The primary drivers of the increases to net interest income and net interest margin were consistent with those described in the quarterly comparisons.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was $912 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared with $883 million in the prior quarter and $952 million in the prior year quarter. The $29 million increase on a sequential quarter basis was due to broad-based growth in consumer and commercial fee categories, led by strong investment banking income, and partially offset by a $32 million decline in net gains on the sale of investment securities. Compared with the second quarter of 2010, noninterest income declined $40 million, or 4%, due to lower net gains on the sale of investment securities, lower service charges on deposit accounts, and lower valuation gains on the Company's index-linked CDs and public debt carried at fair value. The year-over-year decline was partially offset by growth in certain consumer and commercial fee categories, including investment banking, retail investment services, and card fees.
Investment banking income was $95 million in the current quarter compared with $67 million in the prior quarter and $58 million in the prior year quarter. The increases of $28 million and $37 million
 
compared to the prior quarter and prior year, respectively, were attributable to strong syndicated finance fees, which resulted from continued market penetration.
Trading account profits and commissions were $53 million in the current quarter compared with $52 million in the first quarter and $109 million in the second quarter of 2010. Compared to the prior quarter, the essentially flat results were driven by more favorable mark-to-market impacts on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, which offset a decline in core trading income. Compared to the prior year, the $56 million decline in trading account profits and commissions was mainly attributable to a $60 million reduction in valuation gains on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, as the Company's credit spreads tightened.
Mortgage production and servicing income was a combined $76 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $71 million in the prior quarter and $72 million in the prior year quarter. During the current quarter, mortgage repurchase costs were $90 million, an increase of $10 million over the prior quarter due to higher agency-related repurchase requests. As of June 30, 2011, reserves for mortgage repurchases totaled $299 million, an increase of $29 million over March 31, 2011, reflective of higher unresolved repurchase requests. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $162.9 billion at the end of the second quarter.
All other noninterest income categories increased on a sequential quarter basis, including service charges on deposit accounts, which reversed a declining trend from the past three quarters. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, trust income, retail investment income, and card fees all increased, while service charges on deposits declined 18% due to regulatory-induced product changes that became effective in the third quarter of 2010.
For the six months ended June 30
th
, noninterest income was $1,795 million in 2011 and $1,650 million in 2010. The $145 million, or 9%, increase over the prior year was driven by growth across most consumer and commercial fee categories, including investment banking, card fees, retail investment services, and trust income. Higher gains on the sale of investment securities also contributed to the growth, which was partially offset by a decline in service charge income.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was $1,542 million in the current quarter compared with $1,465 million in the prior quarter and $1,503 million in the prior year quarter. The $77 million, or 5%, increase on a sequential quarter basis was largely driven by a $37 million increase in credit-related expenses, attributable to legal and compliance accruals. The FDIC insurance assessment increased $10 million due to a change in the assessment methodology. Personnel-related expenses declined 1% due to seasonal declines in employee benefits, partially offset by higher incentive compensation.
The $39 million, or 3%, increase in noninterest expenses over the second quarter of 2010 was largely driven by a $66 million increase in employee compensation. This was attributable to a 3% increase in personnel  primarily in client service and loss mitigation positions - and higher incentive compensation related to improved business performance. FDIC insurance premiums increased $16 million due to the change in the assessment methodology. Additionally, credit-related expenses increased $15 million as higher legal and compliance costs were partially offset by a decline in other real estate expenses. The second quarter of 2010 also included $63 million of losses related to the extinguishment of debt.
For the six months ended June 30
th
, noninterest expense was $3,007 million in 2011 and $2,864 million in 2010. The 5% increase was attributable to higher personnel-related expenses, credit-related expenses, and FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by lower losses on the extinguishment of debt.
 
Income Taxes
In the second quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $58 million compared with a provision of $33 million in the prior quarter and a $50 million benefit in the second quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate in the current quarter increased to 24.5% and was impacted by the recognition of specific discrete items.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011, and, therefore, did not pay such dividends in the second quarter of 2011. The first quarter of 2011 included $66 million of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury, as well as a $74 million non-cash charge associated with the redemption of the TARP preferred shares. The second quarter of 2010 included $66 million of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2011, SunTrust had total assets of $172.3 billion and shareholders' equity of $19.7 billion, representing 11.4% of total assets. Book and tangible book value per common share were $36.30 and $24.57, respectively, as of June 30, 2011, up 2% and 3%, respectively, from the prior quarter.
Loans
Average loans for the current quarter were $114.9 billion, compared with average balances of $115.2 billion and $113.0 billion during the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010, respectively. While average balances were relatively flat on a sequential quarter basis, commercial & industrial loans increased $1.0 billion, or 2%, while higher-risk categories such as commercial construction and certain other residential real estate-related loans continued to decline. The $1.9 billion, or 2%, average balance increase over the second quarter of 2010 was driven by the acquisition of auto and student loans, as well as from organic growth in commercial & industrial loans and government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans. The risk profile of the loan portfolio continued to improve during the past year; in addition to higher-risk loan categories declining meaningfully, approximately 8% of the Company's loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans as of June 30, 2011, compared to approximately 6% as of June 30, 2010.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits in the second quarter of 2011 were $121.9 billion, compared to average balances of $120.7 billion and $116.5 billion in the prior quarter and prior year quarter, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix continued during the current quarter, as the sequential increase of $1.2 billion, or 1%, was concentrated in demand deposits, while time deposits declined by $0.3 billion, or 1%.
Compared to the second quarter of 2010, average consumer and commercial deposits increased $5.4 billion, or 5%. Average lower-cost deposit products increased a combined $9.7 billion, or 11%, while time deposits declined $4.3 billion, or 18%. While changing client preferences and the economic environment have contributed to this favorable shift in deposit mix, SunTrust also attributes the lower-cost deposit growth to its investments in enhancing the client experience and its marketing initiatives.
 
Capital and Liquidity
The Company's estimated capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios were estimated to have expanded to 11.10% and 9.20%, respectively, and the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased to 8.07% as of June 30, 2011. The Company also has substantial available liquidity, as client deposits have been retained in cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality improved during the quarter, with continued trends of declining net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, and other real estate that began in early 2010. Early stage delinquencies also continued to decline on a sequential quarter basis.
Net charge-offs were $505 million in the current quarter compared to $571 million in the prior quarter and $722 million in the prior year quarter. The $66 million sequential quarter decline was concentrated in residential mortgage loans and was partially offset by a slight increase in commercial & industrial loans. Compared to the second quarter of 2010, net charge-offs decreased $217 million, or 30%, with declines across all loan segments, particularly residential loans. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was 1.76% in the current quarter and declined 25 basis points and 81 basis points from the prior quarter and the prior year quarter, respectively. The provision for credit losses was $392 million in the second quarter of 2011, a decline of $55 million and $270 million compared to the prior quarter and the second quarter of 2010, respectively.
Nonperforming loans totaled $3.6 billion as of June 30, 2011, a decline of $361 million, or 9%, from the prior quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. The sequential quarter decline was primarily driven by reductions in commercial construction loans; however, declines were also prevalent in other loan categories. Compared to June 30, 2010, nonperforming loans were down $1.1 billion, or 23%. The decline was driven primarily by reductions in the commercial construction, residential mortgage, commercial & industrial, and residential construction loan categories. As of June 30, 2011, nonperforming loans represented 3.14% of total loans, down 32 basis points from the prior quarter and down 102 basis points from June 30, 2010. Other real estate owned totaled $483 million as of the end of the quarter, down $217 million, or 31%, since June 30, 2010.
Early stage delinquencies declined to 1.09%, an improvement of 6 basis points from the end of the prior quarter. Excluding government-guaranteed student loans and Ginnie Mae insured repurchased mortgage loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.73%, a decline of 7 basis points from March 31, 2011.
As of June 30, 2011, the allowance for loan losses was $2.7 billion representing 2.40% of total loans, down 9 basis points from March 31, 2011. The allowance for loan losses declined $110 million during the current quarter as a result of the improvement in asset quality.
Accruing restructured loans totaled $2.7 billion and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled $0.9 billion as of June 30, 2011. Both were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter end. $3.1 billion of restructured loans related to residential mortgages, while $0.5 billion were commercial loans.

The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized securities gains is more indicative of the Company's return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company's core businesses which are primarily client relationship and client transaction driven. The return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss), excluding securities (gains)/losses and The Coca-Cola Company stock dividend, net of tax, by average assets less net unrealized securities (gains)/losses.

SunTrust believes that the return on average realized common shareholders' equity is more indicative of the Company's return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to the holding of a specific security. The return on average realized common shareholders' equity is computed by dividing annualized net income/(loss) available to common shareholders, excluding securities (gains)/losses and The Coca-Cola Company stock dividend, net of tax, by average realized common shareholders' equity.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments.

SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.

SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets.

This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.

SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Company's book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
