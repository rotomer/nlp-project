I agree that the arbitrator shall have the additional right to rule on motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment, applying the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(b) I agree that this Agreement contains all the terms that are applicable to my separation from SunTrust and replaces all other agreements I may have with SunTrust related to these issues, except for any benefit plan, incentive or executive compensation plan or arrangement or stock option agreement in which I have a vested benefit as of my last day of employment. I acknowledge that the terms of these benefit plans, incentive plans, and stock option agreements shall remain in full force and effect following my separation from SunTrust and shall not be superceded or replaced by this Agreement or any part thereof. I also agree that this Agreement cannot be changed or enlarged except by a written amendment that is signed by SunTrust and me. If a dispute arises between SunTrust and me related to this Agreement, I understand that, except as otherwise provided herein, it will be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia and, with respect to arbitration, the Federal Arbitration Act. If any provision or portion of a provision of this Agreement is waived by SunTrust or me or is determined to be unlawful or unenforceable, the waiver or finding of unlawfulness or unenforceability will not act as a waiver or finding of unlawfulness or unenforceability of any other provision or portion of a provision of this Agreement.
(c) I grant SunTrust the right to set-off any amounts I owe or in the future may owe to SunTrust under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 "Section 16" and the rules and regulations adopted under Section 16 from time to time, against the amounts SunTrust owes to me under this Agreement.
(d) I understand that this Agreement is not an admission by either SunTrust or me that any statute or law has been violated or that either SunTrust or I have acted improperly or violated any duty or obligation.
(e) I agree that the contents, terms and existence of this Agreement must be kept confidential, and that I will not reveal them to anyone, except my spouse, attorney or accountant or unless required by law or regulatory or administrative agency, without the prior written consent of SunTrust. I also agree not to make disparaging remarks related to my employment with SunTrust at any time before or after my last date of employment with SunTrust, and further agree not to seek or accept employment with SunTrust in the future unless employment occurs because a company employs me at the time it merges with or is acquired by SunTrust.
(f) By signing this Agreement, I acknowledge that I have read and understand its terms, and that I have been advised to consult with an attorney about the Agreement and its binding effect on my rights. I also acknowledge that I am satisfied with the terms of this Agreement, that its terms are binding on me, my agents, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and that I am signing this Agreement on a knowing and voluntary basis. I understand and agree that SunTrust has the right, without my prior consent, to assign this Agreement to any successor, assignee, parent, affiliate, or subsidiary.
(g) I understand that I am entitled to consider the terms of the Agreement for twenty-one (21) days after receiving it. I understand that I may sign it anytime within that twenty-one (21) day period. If I do not sign and return the Agreement on or before the twenty-first (21) day after receiving it, I understand that I will not receive my any compensation or benefits under Paragraph 3 of this Agreement. I understand that (i) I may revoke this Agreement within seven (7) days after signing it, (ii) it cannot become effective and enforceable until after the revocation period expires and (iii) I cannot receive compensation or benefits under Paragraph 3 of this Agreement if I revoke it within the seven (7) day period.
