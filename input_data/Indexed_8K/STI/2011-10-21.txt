News Release
For Immediate Release
October 21, 2011
SunTrust Reports Third Quarter 2011 Results
Earnings Per Share Increased to
$0.39
; Favorable Loan, Deposit, and Asset Quality Trends
 
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders of
$211 million
, or
$0.39
per average common share, for the
third quarter
of
2011
. This compares favorably to earnings of
$0.33
per average common share for the second quarter of 2011. Results benefited from continued improvement in credit quality, resulting in a decline in the provision for credit losses, as well as higher loan balances. Earnings improved significantly from the
$0.17
per average common share reported for the
third quarter
of
2010
.
"Lower-cost deposit growth and improved credit quality continued in the third quarter, said SunTrust President and Chief Executive Officer, William H. Rogers, Jr.  Further, overall loan growth was driven by solid increases in targeted consumer and commercial loan portfolios.  We remain focused on delivering improved shareholder value through the execution of our client-centric initiatives and the implementation of our expense program."

Consolidated Financial Performance
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was
$2.2 billion
for the
third quarter
of
2011
, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and lower by $117 million from the
third quarter
of
2010
. Net gains from the sales of securities were
$2 million
for the third quarter of 2011 compared to
$32 million
for the second quarter of 2011 and
$69 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. Excluding these gains, total revenue increased
1%
compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to increased mortgage production income, and declined
2
% compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, primarily due to lower mortgage-related revenue.
For the
nine months ended
September 30
,
2011
, total revenue was
$6.6 billion
, up
$180 million
, or
3
%, compared to
2010
. The increase was due to higher net interest income, higher valuation gains on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, and growth in most consumer and commercial fee categories. This growth was partially offset by lower service charges, lower mortgage-related revenue, and lower net gains from the sales of investment securities.
Net Interest Income
For the
third quarter
of
2011
, net interest income was
$1,293 million
compared with
$1,286 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,266 million
for the
third quarter
of 2010. The
1%
increase on a sequential quarter basis was primarily related to one more day in the current quarter. The
2%
increase over the
third quarter
of
2010
was driven by lower rates on deposits, a continued shift in deposit mix toward lower-cost deposits, and a reduction in higher-cost funding.
Net interest margin in the
third quarter
of
2011
was
3.49%
, a decline of
four
basis points from the prior quarter and an increase of
eight
basis points from the
third quarter
of
2010
. On a sequential quarter basis, yields on earning assets declined
nine
basis points, driven by lower loan yields, and rates on interest-bearing liabilities declined
five
basis points due to lower rates on deposits and long-term debt. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, the favorable shift in the deposit mix, lower rates paid, and reduced long-term debt contributed to a decline in interest-bearing liabilities of
29
basis points, more than offsetting the
17
basis point decline in earning asset yields.
For the
nine months ended
September 30
,
2011
, net interest income increased
5
% to
$3,855 million
compared to
$3,676 million
for
2010
. Net interest margin was
3.52
% for 2011, up
17
basis points from the prior year due to the decline in rates on deposit accounts more than offsetting the lower yield on earning assets.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was
$903 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
compared with
$912 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,047 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The
$9 million
decline compared to the prior quarter was due to a
$30 million
decline in net gains on the sale of investment securities and lower investment banking income, partially offset by higher mortgage production income and valuation gains on the Company's debt carried at fair value. Compared with the
third quarter
of
2010
, noninterest income declined
$144 million
, or
14
%, due to lower net gains on the sale of investment securities, a decline in investment banking income, and lower mortgage-related income. This was partially offset by growth in trust income, retail investment services, and card fees, as well as higher valuation gains on the Company's index-linked CDs and public debt carried at fair value.
Investment banking income was
$68 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
compared with
$95 million
for the prior quarter and
$96 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The decline in the current quarter was partially due to strong prior quarter results, coupled with challenging market conditions during the current quarter.
Trading account profits and commissions were
$66 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
compared with
$53 million
for the prior quarter and a trading loss of
$22 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The
$13 million
sequential quarter increase was driven by a $53 million increase in valuation gains on the Companys fair value debt and index-linked CDs due to the widened credit spreads of financial institutions during the current quarter. Offsetting these valuation gains was a $24 million increase in valuation losses related to illiquid securities and
3
previously securitized loans. In addition, core trading income was negatively impacted by the volatile markets during the current quarter. The
$88 million
increase in trading account profits and commissions compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
was mainly attributable to $78 million in valuation gains for the current quarter on the Companys fair value debt and index-linked CDs, in comparison to $81 million in valuation losses for the
third quarter
of
2010
. This was partially offset by lower fair market value adjustments on illiquid securities and previously securitized loans, as well as a decline in core trading income.
Mortgage production income was
$54 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
, compared with
$4 million
for the prior quarter and
$133 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The
$50 million
sequential quarter increase was driven by higher loan production and margins resulting from the decline in mortgage rates during the third quarter of 2011, partially offset by higher mortgage repurchase costs. During the quarter, the mortgage repurchase cost was $117 million, an increase of $27 million over the prior quarter due to higher agency-related repurchase requests. As of
September 30
,
2011
, reserves for mortgage repurchases totaled $282 million, a decline of $17 million from the prior quarter, reflective of the increase in resolutions during the third quarter of 2011. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, mortgage production income declined
$79 million
, primarily due to a decrease in refinance volume.
Mortgage servicing income was
$58 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
, compared to
$72 million
for the prior quarter and
$132 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. A decline in the net hedge performance was the primary driver of the
$14 million
sequential quarter decline and the
$74 million
decline compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
. The mortgage servicing portfolio was $161 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011.
Service charges on deposit accounts increased
$6 million
, or
4%
, on a sequential quarter basis while all other noninterest income categories were relatively stable. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, trust income, retail investment income, and card fees all increased.
For the
nine months ended
September 30
, noninterest income of
$2.7 billion
for
2011
was essentially equal to the same period in
2010
. Increases in trust income, retail investment income, investment banking income, card fees, and higher valuation gains on the Companys fair value debt and index-linked CDs were offset by lower mortgage-related income, reduced net gains on the sale of investment securities, and lower service charges on deposit accounts.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was
$1,560 million
for the
current quarter
compared with
$1,542 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,499 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The
1
% increase on a sequential quarter basis was primarily due to a $19 million increase in mortgage-related expenses, including higher operating losses related to mortgage servicing. All other noninterest expenses were essentially flat on a sequential quarter basis.
The
4
% increase in noninterest expense over the
third quarter
of
2010
was primarily due to a $45 million increase in operating losses related to mortgage servicing, a
$41 million
increase in employee compensation, and a
$13 million
increase in FDIC insurance premiums due to the change in assessment methodology. This was partially offset by a $15 million decline in other real estate expenses and a
$13 million
decrease in debt extinguishment costs. The increase in employee compensation was driven by a 3% increase in full-time equivalent employees, primarily in client interfacing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing positions, as well as higher revenue-related compensation due to improved performance in certain businesses.
For the
nine months ended
September 30
, noninterest expense was
$4,567 million
for
2011
and
$4,362 million
for
2010
. The
5
% increase in the current year was attributable to higher personnel-related expenses, mortgage-related expenses, and FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by lower losses on the extinguishment of debt.
4
Income Taxes
For the
third quarter
of
2011
, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of
$45 million
compared with
$58 million
for the prior quarter and
$14 million
for the
third quarter
of
2010
. The effective tax rate of
17.3
% for the third quarter of 2011 compares to
24.5
% for the prior quarter, which was impacted by the recognition of specific discrete items, and 8.3% for the
third quarter
of
2010
.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011, and, therefore, did not pay such dividends in the second or
third quarter
s of
2011
. The first quarter of 2011 included
$66 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury, as well as a
$74 million
non-cash charge associated with the redemption of the TARP preferred shares. The
third quarter
of
2010
included
$67 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Balance Sheet
As of
September 30
,
2011
, SunTrust had total assets of
$172.6 billion
and shareholders equity of
$20.2 billion
, representing
11.7%
of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were
$37.29
and
$25.60
, respectively, as of
September 30
,
2011
, up
3%
and
4%
, respectively, from the
second quarter
.
Loans
Average loans for the third quarter of 2011 were
$115.6 billion
, compared with average balances of
$114.9 billion
and
$113.3 billion
during the
second quarter
of
2011
and the
third quarter
of
2010
, respectively. On a sequential quarter basis, average loans increased $
0.7 billion
, or
1%
. Growth was concentrated in commercial & industrial loans which increased
$1.1 billion
, or
2%
, while higher-risk loan categories such as home equity, commercial real estate, and construction loans continued to decline. Average loans increased
$2.3 billion
, or
2%
, over the
third quarter
of
2010
. Growth from the prior year was driven by targeted loan categories, including commercial & industrial, indirect auto, and government-guaranteed student loans, which increased by approximately $6 billion combined, while residential real estate categories were managed down. The risk profile of the loan portfolio continued to improve during the year; in addition to higher-risk loan categories declining meaningfully, approximately 8% of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans as of
September 30
,
2011
.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the
third quarter
of
2011
were
$123.0 billion
, compared to average balances of
$121.9 billion
and
$117.2 billion
for the
second quarter
of 2011 and
third quarter
of
2010
, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix continued during the quarter. The
$1.1 billion
sequential quarter growth in average deposits was driven by a
$2.1 billion
, or
7%
, increase in demand deposits, partially offset by a decline in interest bearing demand and time deposits.
Compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, average consumer and commercial deposits increased
$5.7 billion
, or
5%
. Average lower-cost deposit products increased a combined
$9.7 billion
, or
10%
, while time deposits declined
$4.0 billion
, or
17%
. While changing client preferences and the economic environment have contributed to this favorable shift in deposit mix, SunTrust also attributes the lower-cost deposit growth to its investments in enhancing the client experience and its marketing initiatives.
Capital and Liquidity
The Companys estimated capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios were estimated at
11.05
% and
9.25
%, respectively, and the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased to
8.38
% as of
September 30
,
2011
.
5
During the quarter, the U.S. Treasury conducted an auction of the Company's warrants which were previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The Company purchased approximately four million of these warrants in the auction, resulting in an $11 million decline in equity. Also during the quarter, the Company announced an increase to its quarterly common dividend to $0.05 per share from $0.01 per share. The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity provided in the form of its client deposit base, other available funding resources, and the retention of cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality improved during the quarter, with declining net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, and early stage delinquencies.
Nonperforming loans totaled
$3.2 billion
as of
September 30
,
2011
, a decline of
$371 million
, or
10
%, from the prior quarter, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans declined to
2.76%
, down
38
basis points from the prior quarter. The sequential quarter decline was primarily driven by reductions in commercial construction, commercial real estate, and commercial & industrial loans. Compared to
September 30
,
2010
, nonperforming loans declined
$1.1 billion
, or
26
%, with the most significant reductions in commercial construction and, to a lesser extent, residential mortgages, commercial & industrial, and residential construction loans. Other real estate owned totaled
$509 million
at the end of the quarter, up
5%
on a sequential quarter basis; however, it was down
$136 million
, or
21
%, since
September 30
,
2010
.
Net charge-offs were
$492 million
compared to
$505 million
in the prior quarter and
$690 million
in the
third quarter
of
2010
. The
$13 million
sequential quarter decline was concentrated in residential mortgage loans. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2010
, net charge-offs decreased
$198 million
, or
29
%, with declines across all loan categories. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was
1.69%
, a decline of
7
basis points and
73
basis points from the
second quarter
of 2011 and the
third quarter
of
2010
, respectively. The provision for credit losses was
$347 million
, a decline of
$45 million
and
$268 million
from the
second quarter
of 2011 and the
third quarter
of
2010
, respectively.
As of
September 30
,
2011
, the allowance for loan losses was
$2.6 billion
and represented
2.22
% of total loans, down
18
basis points from
June 30
,
2011
. The
$144 million
decline in allowance for loan losses during the third quarter of 2011 was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality.
Early stage delinquencies declined to 1.04%, an improvement of five basis points from the end of the
second quarter
of 2011. Excluding government-guaranteed student loans and Ginnie Mae insured repurchased mortgage loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.70%, a decline of three basis points from
June 30
,
2011
.
Accruing restructured loans totaled
$2.8 billion
, and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled
$883 million
as of
September 30
,
2011
. Accruing restructured loans increased
$105 million
, while nonaccruing restructured loans declined
$40 million
. $3.2 billion of restructured loans related to residential loans, while $0.5 billion were commercial loans.

We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, then our operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

Average balances, interest income, and yields are presented using the new loan classifications as initially adopted in the Companys 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the inability of the Company to present 2010 periods using the new classifications, the 2011 amounts have also been presented using prior loan classifications on the next page.

The fully taxable-equivalent(FTE) basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income - FTE by average total earning assets.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiarys federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiarys income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments.

SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Companys performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
