Exhibit 99.1
News Release
For Immediate Release
January 20, 2012
SunTrust Reports Fourth Quarter 2011 Results
Another Quarter of Strong Loan and Deposit Growth; Full Year EPS Up Meaningfully
ATLANTA -- SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) today reported net income available to common shareholders of
$152 million
, or
$0.28
per average common share, for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
. Earnings per average common share compared favorably to
$0.23
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
and declined from
$0.39
in the
third quarter
of
2011
. Strong loan and deposit growth drove results, and credit quality continued to improve. For the year, earnings were
$1.09
per average common share compared to a loss of
$0.18
per average common share in
2010
. The improvement in annual earnings was due to higher net interest income, lower provision for credit losses, and the repayment of TARP.
Our client-centric banking approach is driving momentum in our core business fundamentals, said William H. Rogers, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc.  We experienced healthy loan growth again this quarter, particularly in our commercial and industrial portfolio, which we have targeted for expansion. Our favorable deposit growth and mix trends continued. Additionally, credit quality improved with further declines in net charge-offs and nonperforming loans.  Mr. Rogers also noted that, while the Company is still facing some legacy mortgage challenges, it is making progress in its efforts to reduce its expense base and ultimately improve efficiency.

Consolidated Financial Performance
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was
$2,047 million
for the quarter, lower by
$149 million
from the prior quarter and lower by
$279 million
from the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. Net gains from the sales of securities were
$19 million
for the
fourth quarter
of 2011 compared to
$2 million
for the
third quarter
of 2011 and
$64 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. Excluding net securities gains, total revenue decreased
8%
and
10%
, respectively, compared to the prior quarter and
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The declines were predominantly due to a higher mortgage repurchase provision, a mortgage servicing rights (MSR) valuation adjustment, and lower card fee income, partially offset by higher net interest income.
For
2011
, total revenue, excluding net securities gains, was
$8,483 million
, a modest decline of
$25 million
compared with
2010
. The decrease in noninterest income, namely mortgage-related income and service charges on deposit accounts, was largely offset by increased net interest income.
Net Interest Income
For the
fourth quarter
of
2011
, net interest income was
$1,324 million
compared with
$1,293 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,294 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
2%
increases over both the prior quarter and the
fourth quarter
of
2010
were driven by increased earning assets, lower rates on deposits, and a continued shift in the deposit mix toward low-cost deposits, largely offset by lower earning asset yields. For the year, net interest income increased
4%
.
Net interest margin for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
was
3.46%
, a decline of
three
basis points from the prior quarter and an increase of
two
basis points from the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. On a sequential quarter basis, yields on earning
4
assets declined
eleven
basis points, driven by lower loan and investment securities yields, while rates on interest-bearing liabilities declined
nine
basis points due to lower rates on deposits. Compared to the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, the favorable shift in deposit mix, lower deposit rates, and reduced long-term debt contributed to a decline in interest-bearing liabilities of
25
basis points, more than offsetting the
20
basis point decline in earning asset yields. Net interest margin was
3.50
% for 2011, up
twelve
basis points from
2010
due to the decline in rates on deposits more than offsetting the lower yield on earning assets.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was
$723 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared to
$903 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,032 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
$180 million
decline compared to the prior quarter was driven by a higher mortgage repurchase provision, the MSR valuation adjustment associated with HARP 2.0, and lower card fee income. These declines were partially offset by higher investment banking income and an increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities. The decline of
$309 million
from the
fourth quarter
of
2010
was also largely attributable to the higher mortgage repurchase provision, the MSR valuation adjustment, and lower card fees, with additional declines occurring across most other fee income categories.
Mortgage production income was a loss of
$62 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
, compared to income of
$54 million
for the prior quarter and
$41 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
$116 million
sequential quarter decrease was predominantly driven by a $98 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, due to higher agency-related repurchase requests and an increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve. As of
December 31
,
2011
, reserves for mortgage repurchases totaled $320 million, an increase of $38 million from the prior quarter. Compared to the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, mortgage production income declined
$103 million
, primarily due to an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, partially offset by higher income from loan production activities.
Mortgage servicing income was
$22 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared to
$58 million
for the prior quarter and
$68 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. An increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to anticipated refinancing activity arising from the HARP 2.0 program resulted in a $38 million decline in the fair value of the MSR. The mortgage servicing portfolio was
$158 billion
at the end of the
fourth quarter
of
2011
.
Card fee income was
$62 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared to
$104 million
for the prior quarter and
$99 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
.  The decrease in the current quarter was a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of this quarter.
Investment banking income was
$87 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared to
$68 million
for the prior quarter and
$103 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The increase in the current quarter was due to higher loan syndication fee income. The decline relative to the fourth quarter of 2010 came across most capital markets fee categories, as the prior year quarter posted record investment banking revenue.
Trading account profits and commissions were
$77 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared with
$66 million
for the prior quarter and
$93 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
$11 million
sequential quarter increase was largely attributable to market conditions that were less volatile in the fourth quarter of 2011. Predominantly offsetting the increase from the more favorable market conditions was a $61 million decline in valuation gains related the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, net of hedges. Such gains totaled $78 millio
5
n during the third quarter of 2011, driven by the widening of financial institutions' credit spreads amidst the third quarter market volatility; during the fourth quarter of 2011, these fair value gains, net of hedges, totaled $17 million. The
$16 million
decrease in trading account profits and commissions compared to the
fourth quarter
of
2010
was largely driven by lower valuation gains on illiquid securities.
Other noninterest income was
$39 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
compared with
$53 million
for the prior quarter and
$70 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
$14 million
sequential quarter decrease was largely driven by lower leasing gains and certain asset write-downs. The
$31 million
decline compared to the
fourth quarter
of
2010
was largely driven by a gain from the sale of the money market mutual fund business in the
fourth quarter
of
2010
and the aforementioned asset write-downs.
For the full year, noninterest income was
$3.4 billion
for
2011
, lower by
$308 million
compared to the full year
6
2010
. Decreases in mortgage-related income, service charges on deposit accounts (due to Reg. E), other fee income, and gains on sale of investment securities were partially offset by increased trust income, retail investment income, and higher valuation gains on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was
$1,547 million
for the
current quarter
compared to
$1,560 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,548 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The modest changes from both the sequential quarter and prior year were predominantly due to a decrease in employee compensation and benefits expenses offset by increases in severance expense, credit-related expenses, and operating losses.
Employee compensation and benefits expense declined from the prior quarter by
$126 million
, driven by a $60 million gain recorded in connection with the decision to curtail the Company's defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by a discretionary 401(k) contribution. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits declined due to a fourth quarter 2011 reduction in incentives that are tied to the Company's annual financial performance.  The
$114 million
decline in employee compensation and benefits from the fourth quarter of 2010 was attributable to these same factors.
Other noninterest expense increased
$79 million
from the prior quarter and $53 million from the prior year quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company accrued $27 million in severance expense related to its Playbook for Profitable Growth (PPG) initiative. Significant strides in the design and implementation of the PPG initiatives occurred, resulting in the recognition of the severance costs and a decline in full-time equivalent employees. At year end 2011, $75 million in annualized expenses had been eliminated from the expense base, compared to the $300 million goal expected to be achieved by year end 2013. Credit and collections expenses increased by approximately $20 million from both the prior quarter and prior year quarter due to costs associated with the servicing and resolution of nonperforming loans. The remaining variance in other noninterest expense from the prior quarter was largely attributable to affordable housing write-downs and consulting expenses, which both increased by approximately $10 million.
Operating losses increased by
$24 million
from the prior quarter and
$70 million
from the prior year quarter. The sequential quarter increase was due to increased litigation-related expenses tied to specific claims. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 was primarily due to litigation expenses and operating losses associated with mortgage servicing. The Company recently commenced discussions related to a mortgage servicing settlement. Because these discussions are in the preliminary stages, we are not able to provide an estimate and have not recorded an accrual for the potential financial impact in the Company's 2011 financial results. We expect to provide an update on this matter in the upcoming Form 10-K, which may include recording a charge effective December 31, 2011, in accordance with the appropriate accounting standards.
For the
year ended
December 31
, noninterest expense was
$6.1 billion
for
2011
and
$5.9 billion
for
2010
. The
3
% increase in the current year was attributable to increased employee compensation and benefits expenses, operating losses, and FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by lower losses on the extinguishment of debt.
 
The increase in employee compensation and benefits was predominantly related to higher compensation arising from improved business performance as compared to the full year 2010, as well as increases during 2011 in client-facing full-time equivalent employees. This was partially offset by the gain related to the pension curtailment. The increase in operating losses related to increased mortgage-related expenses and litigation expenses tied to specific claims.  The increase in FDIC expense was the result of a change in the assessment methodology during the current year.

Income Taxes
For the
fourth quarter
of
2011
, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of
$18 million
compared to an income tax provision of
$45 million
for both the
third quarter
of
2011
and
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The effective tax rate of
(12.9)
% for the fourth quarter of 2011 compares to
17.3
% for the prior quarter and
19.7
% for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The effective tax rate for each quarterly period was primarily the result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. Such items, together with the decline in pre-tax earnings from the third quarter of 2011, resulted in the negative effective tax rate for the current quarter. For
2011
, the Company recognized
an income tax provision of
$118 million
and an effective tax rate of
13.9
% compared to an income tax benefit of
$185
8
million
in 2010.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and, therefore, did not pay such dividends during the last three quarters of
2011
. The first quarter of 2011 included
$66 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury as well as a
$74 million
non-cash charge associated with the redemption of the TARP preferred shares. The
fourth quarter
of
2010
included
$67 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury.
Balance Sheet
As of
December 31
,
2011
, the Company had total assets of
$176.9 billion
and shareholders equity of
$20.1 billion
, representing
11.4%
of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share were
$37.01
and
$25.33
, respectively, as of
December 31
,
2011
, both down
1%
from the
third quarter
, predominantly due to lower accumulated other comprehensive income from market-related items, partially offset by higher retained earnings.
Loans
Average loans for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
were
$119.5 billion
, compared to average loans of
$115.6 billion
and
$114.9 billion
during the
third quarter
of
2011
and the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, respectively. On a sequential quarter basis, the $
3.8 billion
, or
3%
growth was concentrated in commercial & industrial loans, which increased
$2.2 billion
, or
5%
, and government-guaranteed student loans, which grew
$1.2 billion
as a result of portfolio acquisitions. Higher-risk loan categories such as home equity, commercial real estate, and construction loans continued to decline. Average loans increased
$4.5 billion
, or
4%
, over the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. Growth over the prior year was driven by targeted loan categories, including commercial & industrial, indirect auto, and government-guaranteed student and residential mortgage loans, which increased by approximately $8 billion combined, while residential real estate categories declined. The risk profile of the loan portfolio continued to improve during the year; in addition to higher-risk loan categories declining meaningfully, approximately
11%
of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans as of
December 31
,
2011
, up from
8%
at the end of 2010.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
were
$125.1 billion
, compared to
$123.0 billion
and
$119.7 billion
for the
third quarter
of
2011
and
fourth quarter
of
2010
, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix continued during the quarter, with the
$2.1 billion
sequential quarter growth in average deposits being driven by a
$2.1 billion
, or
7%
, increase in demand deposits and a
$1.0 billion
, or
4%
, increase in NOW accounts. Time deposits declined
$0.8 billion
, or
4%
.
Compared with the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, average consumer and commercial deposits increased
$5.4 billion
, or
4%
. Average low-cost deposits increased a combined
$8.3 billion
, or
8%
, while time deposits declined
$2.9 billion
, or
13%
.
Capital and Liquidity
The Companys estimated capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios were estimated at
10.95
% and
9.25
%, respectively. The ratios of total equity to total assets and tangible equity to tangible assets were
11.39%
and
8.14
%, respectively, as of
December 31
,
2011
. The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity provided in the form of its client deposit base, other available funding resources, and the retention of cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter, with declining net charge-offs,
nonperforming loans, and nonperforming assets. Nonperforming loans totaled
$2.9 billion
as of
December 31
,
2011
, a decline of
$336 million
,
9
or
10
%, from the prior quarter, marking the tenth consecutive quarterly decline. The percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans declined to
2.37%
, down
39
basis points from the prior quarter. The sequential quarter decline was primarily driven by reductions in commercial construction, commercial real estate, and commercial & industrial loans, while residential mortgage nonperforming loans also declined modestly. Compared to
December 31
,
2010
, nonperforming loans declined
$1.2 billion
, or
29
%, with the most significant reductions in commercial construction; also contributing to the decline were residential mortgages, commercial & industrial, and residential construction loans. Other real estate owned totaled
$479 million
at the end of the quarter, down
6%
on a sequential quarter basis and down
20
% since
December 31
,
2010
.
Net charge-offs were
$472 million
in the current quarter compared to
$492 million
for the prior quarter and
$621 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2010
. The
$20 million
sequential quarter decline was concentrated in commercial construction, partially offset by increases in commercial & industrial and non-guaranteed residential mortgages. Compared to the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, net charge-offs decreased
$149 million
, or
24
%, with declines across almost all loan categories, most prominently non-guaranteed mortgages, commercial construction, commercial & industrial, and home equity. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was
1.57%
, a decline of
twelve
basis points and
57
basis points from the
third quarter
of
2011
and the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, respectively. The provision for credit losses was
$327 million
, a decline of
$20 million
and
$185 million
from the
third quarter
of
2011
and the
fourth quarter
of
2010
, respectively.
As of
December 31
,
2011
, the allowance for loan losses was
$2.5 billion
and represented
2.01
% of total loans, down
21
basis points from
September 30
,
2011
. The
$143 million
decline in the allowance for loan losses during the
fourth quarter
of
2011
was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality.
Early stage delinquencies increased to 1.17%, an increase of thirteen basis points from the end of the
third quarter
of
2011
. This quarterly increase was due to the fourth quarter 2011 acquisition of certain student loan portfolios, which carry a government guarantee. Excluding all government-guaranteed loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.68%, a decline of two basis points from
September 30
,
2011
.
Accruing restructured loans totaled
$2.8 billion
, and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled
$802 million
as of
December 31
,
2011
. Accruing restructured loans remained stable, while nonaccruing restructured loans declined
$81 million
compared to the prior quarter. $3.1 billion of restructured loans related to residential loans, while $0.5 billion were commercial loans.

Average balances, interest income, and yields are presented using the new loan classifications as initially adopted in the Companys 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the inability of the Company to present 2010 periods using the new classifications, the 2011 amounts have also been presented using prior loan classifications on the next page.

The fully taxable-equivalent(FTE) basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income - FTE by average total earning assets.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiarys federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiarys income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments.

SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Companys performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
