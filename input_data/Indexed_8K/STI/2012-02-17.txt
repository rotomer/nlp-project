(e) Co-Investment RSU Grants
On February 14, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of SunTrust Banks, Inc. made equity awards to certain senior executive officers of the Company, including the named executive officers shown below.
The grants are in the form of performance-vested restricted stock units, each of which will be settled in one share of SunTrust common stock after vesting. The entire amount of each award will vest only if the Company's achieves a 4-year return on assets target, and the entire award will be forfeited if actual performance does not equal or exceed the performance target. As such, this special one-time award is designed to drive future performance and is in addition to annual long-term incentive awards.
The awards are also subject to additional equity retention requirements.
Each award is subject to standard SunTrust clawback provisions regarding miscalculations of the performance metric, detrimental conduct, or in the event of certain losses. Each award is also contingent upon the performance of certain covenants restricting the participant from soliciting customers or employees, and from disclosing or using confidential information.
The awards will be forfeited upon the participant's termination of employment except in the case of death, disability, or termination of employment in connection with a change in control, in which cases the entire award will vest, and except in the case of a termination of employment as a result of a reduction in force in which the award will vest pro rata. Awards made to retirement eligible participants may continue to vest after retirement if the participant performs additional restrictive covenants including a noncompete.
