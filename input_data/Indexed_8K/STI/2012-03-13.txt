SunTrust Announces Stress Test Results and Provides Earnings Update
ATLANTA -- SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) announced that the Federal Reserve completed its annual review of SunTrust's capital plan, submitted in January in connection with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).
The Federal Reserve review showed that SunTrusts capital exceeded requirements throughout the Supervisory Stress Test time horizon without any capital actions. As a result of this review, SunTrust will not be increasing its return of capital to shareholders at this time; however, SunTrust expects to:
     Maintain its current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share.
SunTrust has strong Tier 1 common capital of 9.2 percent and improved earnings momentum, said SunTrust Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William H. Rogers, Jr. Our client-centric strategy has resulted in high levels of client loyalty and strong market share growth. In addition, the composition and risk profile of SunTrusts loan portfolio have improved significantly over the past several years, leading to markedly lower levels of loan losses.
Mr. Rogers also noted that the company has increased its Tier 1 common capital over multiple consecutive quarters.
Regarding the Federal Reserves Supervisory Stress Test for SunTrust, Chief Financial Officer Aleem Gillani said, The Federal Reserve noted that their estimates were for a hypothetical, severely adverse scenario that employed conservative and simplifying assumptions. Using our own modeling techniques -- which have shown to have a high level of predictability -- SunTrusts estimates for loan losses and pre-provision net revenue in the Supervisory Stress scenario are significantly more favorable than those made by the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Gillani added that SunTrusts improved earnings momentum has continued in the first quarter of 2012 and is expected to result in earnings per share that exceed the first quarter First Call mean estimate.

Important Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements
The foregoing statement is based on our interim financial results as of February 29, 2012, and the first quarter First Call mean earnings per share estimate at March 13, 2012.
Our expectations for first quarter financial results relative to the first quarter First Call mean earnings per share estimate at March 13, 2012 is a forward-looking statement and is based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Our statement speaks as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update this statement or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statement in light of new information or future events. 
Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Item 1A of Part I of our 10-K and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages,
and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond
-more-
insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or
master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or
unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of
-more-
operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our
accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.
