Consolidated Financial Performance Details
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was
$2.2 billion
for the
first quarter
of
2012
, an increase of
$171 million
from the prior quarter and
$58 million
higher than the
first quarter
of
2011
. Net gains from the sales of securities were
$18 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$19 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and
$64 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. Excluding net securities gains, total revenue increased
8%
and
5%
, respectively, compared to the fourth and
first quarter
s of
2011
. The increase in revenue was predominantly due to higher mortgage-related revenue and higher net interest income.
Net Interest Income
For the
first quarter
of
2012
, net interest income was
$1,342 million
compared to
$1,324 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,277 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
1%
and
5%
increases over the fourth and
first quarter
s of
2011
, respectively, were driven by higher loan balances and lower interest expense, the latter of which was a result of the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts and lower wholesale funding costs.
Net interest margin for the
first quarter
of
2012
was
3.49%
, an increase of
three
basis points from the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and a decline of
four
basis points from the
first quarter
of
2011
. On a sequential quarter basis, the increase was driven by a
nine
basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs due to lower rates paid on deposits and other funding sources. This was partially offset by a
five
basis point decline in earning asset yields, due to lower loan yields. Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, the decline in the net interest margin was primarily due to
5%
growth in earning assets, as the
30
basis point decline in earning asset yields due to lower loan yields was offset by a
30
basis point decline in interest-bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid on deposits and other funding sources.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was
$876 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$723 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and
$883 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$153 million
sequential quarter increase was driven by higher mortgage-related revenue, partially offset by lower revenue from investment banking, trading income, and service charges on deposits accounts. The decline of
$7 million
from the
first quarter
of
2011
was attributable to lower securities gains and card fees, largely offset by higher mortgage-related income.
Mortgage production income was
$63 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
, compared to losses of
$62 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and
$1 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$125 million
sequential quarter increase was predominantly driven by increased mortgage loan production volume, higher gain on sale margins, and a $40 million decrease in the mortgage repurchase provision. As of
March 31
,
2012
, reserves for mortgage repurchases totaled $383 million, an increase of $63 million from the prior quarter. The reserve was increased due to the continued high level of repurchase demands received during the quarter and because the decline in mortgage repurchase losses could be largely related to timing. Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, mortgage production income increased
$64 million
, primarily due to higher loan production and increased gain on sale margins, partially offset by an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Mortgage loan production increased 12% over the sequential quarter and 33% over the first quarter of 2011 as refinancing activity increased due to the HARP 2.0 program and the low mortgage interest rate environment.
Mortgage servicing income was
$81 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$22 million
for the prior quarter and
$72 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$59 million
sequential quarter increase was due to improved net hedge performance in the current quarter, as well as a $38 million reduction in the fair value of the MSR asset that was recognized during the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of increased refinancing activity arising from the HARP 2.0 program. Improved net hedge performance was the primary driver of the current quarter increase over the
first quarter
of
2011
. The mortgage servicing portfolio was
$155 billion
at the end of the
first quarter
of
2012
.
Card fees were
$61 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
, essentially equal to the prior quarter and down
$39 million
from the
first quarter
of
2011
. The decline from the prior year was the result of regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
3
Investment banking income was
$71 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$87 million
for the prior quarter and
$67 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter decline was due to seasonally lower loan syndication fee income, partially offset by higher bond origination fees. The increase relative to the
first quarter
of
2011
was attributable to higher bond origination fees.
Trading income was
$57 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$77 million
for the prior quarter and
$52 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$20 million
sequential quarter decline was attributable to the improvement in the Company's credit spreads during the current quarter, which resulted in a $22 million market valuation loss on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, net of hedges, compared to market valuation gains of $17 million in the prior quarter. Partially offsetting the impact from market valuation losses was an increase in core trading activity and a decrease in valuation losses on illiquid securities in the current quarter. The
$5 million
increase in trading income compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
was primarily driven by higher core trading activity, which was partially offset by lower valuation gains on illiquid securities.
Other noninterest income was
$57 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$39 million
for the prior quarter and
$47 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$18 million
sequential quarter increase was largely driven by higher leasing gains in the current quarter and certain asset write-downs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011. The
$10 million
increase compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
was also largely due to higher leasing gains.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was
$1,541 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
$1,667 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and
$1,465 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The decrease of
$126 million
, or
8%
, compared to the prior quarter was largely driven by the $120 million accrual for the potential mortgage servicing settlement recorded in the
fourth quarter
of
2011
. Declines in most other expense categories were predominantly offset by increased employee compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, expenses increased
$76 million
, or
5%
, driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and operating losses.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased
$173 million
from the prior quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 included a $60 million gain in connection with the Company's decision to curtail its defined benefit pension plans, net of a discretionary 401(k) contribution. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits expense was reduced in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to a year-end reduction in incentive compensation related to the Company's full year 2011 financial performance.  The balance of the sequential quarter increase was primarily attributable to seasonally higher 401(k) and payroll taxes in the current quarter. The
$43 million
, or
6%
, increase in employee compensation and benefits expense from the
first quarter
of
2011
was due to higher incentive compensation associated with improved business performance and annual salary increases, partially offset by a 437 person reduction in full-time equivalent employees.
Operating losses declined by
$36 million
from the prior quarter and increased by
$33 million
from the
first quarter
of
2011
. The changes in both periods were driven by litigation-related expenses, which tend to fluctuate based on specific legal matters, as well as operating losses associated with mortgage servicing, which decreased in the current period compared to the prior quarter but increased relative to the first quarter of 2011.
Other noninterest expense decreased
$103 million
from the prior quarter. Credit-related expenses, which is comprised of other real estate-related expenses and credit and collection costs, decreased $55 million due to seasonally higher tax and insurance payments on delinquent loans occurring in the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as lower losses recognized on OREO during the current quarter. Severance expense related to the Playbook for Profitable Growth (PPG) initiative was $10 million during the first quarter of 2012, a decline of $17 million compared to the prior quarter. As of the end of the current quarter, $190 million in annualized expenses had been eliminated from the Company's expense base through PPG, compared to the $300 million goal expected to be achieved by year end 2013. Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, other expenses increased
$12 million
driven by higher consulting expense associated with complying with the mortgage servicing Consent Order, partially offset by a decline in other real estate expense.
Other drivers of the sequential quarter decline in noninterest expense included a
$32 million
reduction in marketing and customer development, due to seasonally lower advertising spending, and a
$16 million
decrease in FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments.
4
Income Taxes
For the
first quarter
of
2012
, the Company recorded an income tax provision of
$69 million
compared to an income tax benefit of
$57 million
for the
fourth quarter
of
2011
and a provision of
$33 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The effective tax rate was
22
% for the
first quarter
of
2012
compared to
16
% for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The effective tax rate for each quarterly period was primarily the result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. Such items, together with the relatively lower pre-tax earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011, resulted in the net tax benefit for that quarter.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities through the first quarter of 2011. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and, therefore, did not pay such dividends during
2012
or the last three quarters of 2011. The
first quarter
of
2011
included
$66 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury and a $74 million, or $0.14 per common share, non-cash charge related to the unamortized discount that was recognized upon the redemption of the TARP preferred shares.
Balance Sheet
As of
March 31
,
2012
, the Company had total assets of
$178.2 billion
and shareholders equity of
$20.2 billion
, representing
11.4%
of total assets. Book value and tangible book value per common share increased to
$37.11
and
$25.49
, respectively, as of
March 31
,
2012
.
Loans
Average loans for the
first quarter
of
2012
were
$122.5 billion
, compared to average loans of
$119.5 billion
and
$115.2 billion
during the fourth and
first quarter
s of
2011
, respectively. On a sequential quarter basis, the $
3.1 billion
, or
3%
, growth was concentrated in commercial & industrial loans, which increased
$1.1 billion
, government-guaranteed mortgage loans, which increased
$1.2 billion
, and government-guaranteed student loans, which grew by
$1.3 billion
primarily as a result of portfolio acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average loans increased
$7.4 billion
, or
6%
, over the
first quarter
of
2011
. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including commercial & industrial and government-guaranteed student and residential mortgage loans, which increased by over $10 billion combined, while certain real estate-related loan categories were managed down. The reduction in real estate-related loans, together with an increase in government-guaranteed loans, resulted in continued improvement in the risk profile of the loan portfolio. As of
March 31
,
2012
,
11%
of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans, up from
8%
at the end of the
first quarter
of
2011
.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the
first quarter
of
2012
were
$125.8 billion
, compared to
$125.1 billion
and
$120.7 billion
for the fourth and
first quarter
s of
2011
, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower cost accounts continued during the quarter, with the
$0.8 billion
sequential quarter growth in average deposits being driven by a
$1.3 billion
, or
4%
, increase in demand deposits, partially offset by a
$0.7 billion
, or
4%
decline in time deposits.
Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, average consumer and commercial deposits increased
$5.1 billion
, or
4%
. Average demand deposits increased
$7.1 billion
, or
25%
, while time deposits declined
$2.4 billion
, or
12%
.
5
Capital and Liquidity
The Companys estimated capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed guidelines recently published by the Basel Committee and endorsed by U.S. regulatory agencies. The Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios were estimated at
10.95%
and
9.30%
, respectively. The ratios of total average equity to total average assets and tangible equity to tangible assets were
11.45
% and
8.14
%, respectively, as of
March 31
,
2012
. The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity provided in the form of its client deposit base, other available funding resources, and the retention of cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter, with declines in early-stage delinquencies, net charge-offs,
nonperforming loans, and nonperforming assets.
Nonperforming loans declined for the eleventh consecutive quarter and totaled
$2.6 billion
as of
March 31
,
2012
. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2011, the
$254 million
, or
9
%, decline occurred across virtually all loan categories, most prominently in commercial construction and residential mortgages. A portion of the decline was attributable to the transfer of $86 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans to held for sale, as the Company elected to actively market these loans and intends to sell them during the second quarter of 2012. As a result of transferring the loans to held for sale, the Company recognized a $26 million charge-off to reflect the loans' estimated market value. Compared to
March 31
,
2011
, nonperforming loans declined
$1.3 billion
, or
33
%, with declines across all categories, most significantly in commercial construction. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, the percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was
2.16%
, down by
21
and
130
basis points from the fourth and first quarters of 2011, respectively. Other real estate owned totaled
$411 million
at the end of the current quarter, down
14%
on a sequential quarter basis and down
23
% since
March 31
,
2011
.
Net charge-offs were
$422 million
in the current quarter compared to
$472 million
for the prior quarter and
$571 million
for the
first quarter
of
2011
. The
$50 million
sequential quarter decline was spread across almost all categories except for residential mortgages, which was impacted by incremental charge-offs related to the transfer of nonperforming loans to held for sale. Compared to the
first quarter
of
2011
, net charge-offs decreased
$149 million
, or
26
%, with declines widespread across loan categories, most notably residential loans. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was
1.38%
, a reduction of
19
basis points and
63
basis points from the fourth and
first quarter
s of
2011
, respectively. The provision for credit losses was
$317 million
, down by
$10 million
and
$130 million
from the prior quarter and the
first quarter
of
2011
, respectively.
As of
March 31
,
2012
, the allowance for loan losses was
$2.3 billion
and represented
1.92
% of total loans, down
nine
basis points from
December 31
,
2011
. The
$109 million
decline in the allowance for loan losses during the
first quarter
of
2012
was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio.
Early stage delinquencies decreased 13 basis points to 1.04% from the end of the
fourth quarter
of
2011
. This quarterly decrease was primarily due to improvement in the home equity, non-guaranteed mortgage, and consumer indirect portfolios. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.59%, a decline of nine basis points from
December 31
,
2011
.
Accruing restructured loans totaled
$2.8 billion
, and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled
$0.7 billion
as of
March 31
,
2012
. Accruing restructured loans declined moderately, while nonaccruing restructured loans declined
$88 million
compared to the prior quarter. $3.1 billion of restructured loans related to residential loans, while $0.4 billion were commercial loans.

Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or
8
security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

The fully taxable-equivalent(FTE) basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiarys federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiarys income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Companys performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
7
SunTrust presents a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.

SunTrust Banks, Inc. 1Q 2012 Earnings Presentation April 23, 2012
 
2 Important Cautionary Statement The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes and other information contained in the Companys 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrusts performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided within or in the appendix of this presentation. In this presentation, net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, and ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. Statements regarding future levels of or impact of mortgage repurchase demands, future levels of non-performing loans and net charge-offs, future levels of net interest income and net interest margin, and efficiency and cost-saving goals are forward-looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, goals, targets, initiatives, potentially, probably, projects, outlook or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as may, will, should, would, and could. Forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Our statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.
