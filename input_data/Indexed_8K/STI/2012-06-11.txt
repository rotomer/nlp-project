SunTrust Announces Redemption of Certain Trust Preferred Securities
ATLANTA  SunTrust Banks, Inc. (NYSE: STI) announced today that it will redeem in whole at par certain trust preferred securities including all of the outstanding:
The aggregate principal amount of the Securities outstanding is approximately $1,187,829,000. Each security holder will receive the par value of the security plus an accrued, but unpaid, interest to the redemption date. The paying agent is U.S. Bank National Association and the Customer Service contact phone number is 1-800-934-6802. The complete terms and conditions of the redemption are as set forth in SunTrusts notice to holders of the Securities.
Under the terms of the indentures related to the Securities, both Securities contain a redemption option that could be exercised by SunTrust Banks, Inc. at any time within ninety (90) days following the occurrence of a Capital Treatment Event (as such term is defined in each
related indenture). On June 7, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve approved in a public meeting a notice of proposed rulemaking, as required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which will eliminate the ability of SunTrust to treat the aggregate liquidation amount of the Securities as Tier 1 capital. Consequently, SunTrust has determined that such regulations constitute a Capital Treatment Event for purposes of the indentures and is calling the Securities pursuant to its option to do so under the terms of each indenture.
This press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security.
