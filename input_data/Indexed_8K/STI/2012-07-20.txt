Consolidated Financial Performance Details
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was
$2.2 billion
for the
second quarter
of
2012
, an increase of
$28 million
from the prior quarter and
$48 million
higher than the
second quarter
of
2011
. Net gains from the sales of securities were
$14 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$18 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
$32 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. Excluding net securities gains, total revenue increased
1%
and
3%
compared to the
first quarter
of
2012
and
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The increase in revenue was predominantly due to higher mortgage-related revenue.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, total revenue, excluding securities gains and losses, was
$4.4 billion
, up
4%
over the first six months of 2011. The increase was driven by higher mortgage-related revenue and higher net interest income, partially offset by a decline in card fees.
Net Interest Income
For the
second quarter
of
2012
, net interest income was
$1,306 million
compared to
$1,342 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,286 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
3%
decline from the
first
quarter of
2012
was largely driven by the reduction in income derived from previously terminated interest rate swaps utilized to manage interest rate risk on commercial loans. The
2%
increase in net interest income compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
was due to higher average loan balances, the favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts, and lower rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt, which was partially offset by lower yields on average earning assets.
Net interest margin for the
second quarter
of
2012
was
3.39%
, a decline of 10 basis points from the
first quarter
of
2012
and a decline of
14
basis points from the
second quarter
of
2011
. On a sequential quarter basis, the decline was primarily driven by the reduction in swap income, which was the primary contributor to the
11
basis point decline in earning assets yields, while rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities remained relatively stable. Compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
, the decline in the net interest margin was primarily due to a
40
basis point decline in loan yields, the result of the continued low interest rate environment. The decline in loan yields was partially offset by a
24
basis point decline in interest-bearing liabilities due to lower rates paid on deposits, primarily due to the shift towards lower-cost accounts, and lower long-term debt rates.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net interest income was $
2,648 million
in 2012 compared to $
2,563 million
in 2011, an increase of
$85 million
, or
3%
. Net interest margin was
3.44%
in
2012
compared to
3.53%
in
2011
. The primary drivers of the increase in net interest income and the decline in net interest margin are consistent with those described in the quarterly comparisons.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was
$940 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$876 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
$912 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
$64 million
sequential quarter increase was driven by higher mortgage production-related revenue and increases in multiple other consumer and commercial noninterest income categories, partially offset by lower mortgage servicing revenue. The increase of
$28 million
over the
second quarter
of
2011
was attributable to higher mortgage production-related revenue and higher trading income, partially offset by lower securities gains, investment banking income, and card fees.
Mortgage production income was
$103 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
, compared to
$63 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
$4 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
$40 million
sequential quarter increase was predominantly driven by $18 million in net gains from the sale of government guaranteed mortgages and a $20 million decrease in the mortgage repurchase provision. As of
June 30
,
2012
, the reserve for mortgage repurchases totaled $434 million, an increase of $51 million from the prior quarter. The reserve increased due to the continued relatively high level of repurchase demands received during the quarter and the timing of demand resolution. Compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
, mortgage production income increased
$99 million
, primarily due to higher loan production and increased gain on sale margins, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision.
3
Mortgage loan production volume increased 8% on a sequential quarter basis due to an increase in home purchase activity. Production volume increased 76% over the
second quarter
of
2011
due to the low mortgage interest rate environment and the HARP 2.0 program.
Mortgage servicing income was
$70 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$81 million
for the prior quarter and
$72 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
$11 million
sequential quarter decline was due to less favorable hedge performance than in the prior quarter. The mortgage servicing portfolio was
$153 billion
at the end of the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$163 billion
at
June 30
,
2011
.
Card fees were
$66 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
, compared to
$61 million
for the prior quarter and
$105 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
8%
sequential quarter increase was due to increased transaction volume, while the
37%
decline from the prior year was the result of regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Investment banking income was
$75 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$71 million
for the prior quarter and
$95 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter increase was due to higher bond origination fees, partially offset by lower syndicated finance fees. The decline relative to the
second quarter
of
2011
was attributable to lower syndicated finance fee income, partially offset by increased bond origination and M&A transaction fee income.
Trading income was
$70 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
$57 million
for the prior quarter and
$53 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The
$13 million
sequential quarter increase was primarily attributable to a $20 million decline in mark-to-market losses on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs during the current quarter. The
$17 million
increase in trading income compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
was largely driven by higher core trading income due to improved market conditions.
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, noninterest income was
$1,816 million
in 2012 and
$1,795 million
in 2011. The
$21 million
, or
1%
, increase was primarily driven by higher mortgage-related income, partially offset by lower securities gains and lower card fees.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was
$1,546 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and was relatively flat compared to
$1,541 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
$1,542 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. On a sequential quarter basis, the seasonal decline in employee benefits expense was offset by increases in credit-related and other operating expenses, as well as
$13
million in non-cash charges associated with the previously announced redemption of higher cost trust preferred securities. Compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
, increases in personnel costs, outside processing expenses, and the aforementioned debt extinguishment loss were offset by decreases in FDIC assessment premiums, marketing expenses, and credit-related expenses. As of the end of the current quarter, $250 million in annualized expenses had been eliminated from the Company's expense base through the Playbook for Profitable Growth program, compared to the $300 million goal expected to be achieved by year end 2013.
Employee compensation and benefits expense declined
$35 million
from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to seasonally higher 401(k) and payroll taxes in the prior quarter. The
$14 million
, or
2%
, increase in employee compensation and benefits expense compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
was due to improved business performance and modest annual merit increases
.
Credit-related expenses, which are included in other noninterest expense and comprised of other real estate-related expenses and credit and collection costs, increased $7 million on a sequential quarter basis due to accruals for anticipated tax and insurance payments on delinquent mortgage loans. Credit-related expenses declined $11 million compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
due to lower losses recognized on OREO during the current quarter.
Operating losses increased by
$9 million
and
$7 million
from the prior quarter and the
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by litigation-related expenses as well as operating losses associated with mortgage-related activities.
Compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
, FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments declined
$21 million
, and marketing and customer development declined
$14 million
due to reduced advertising spending.
4
For the six months ended June 30, 2012, noninterest expense was
$3.1
billion compared to
$3.0 billion
in
2011
. The
$80
million, or
3%
, increase was due to increases in: employee compensation, largely driven by improved business performance, operating losses associated primarily with mortgage-related activities, and outside processing and software costs. These increases were partially offset by declines in marketing and customer development expenses and a decline in FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments.
Income Taxes
For the
second quarter
of
2012
, the Company recorded an income tax provision of
$91 million
compared to
$69 million
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
$58 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The effective tax rate was
25
% for the
second quarter
of
2012
compared to
22
% for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
24
% for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The effective tax rate for each quarterly period was primarily the result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities through the first quarter of 2011. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and, therefore, did not pay such dividends during
2012
or the last three quarters of 2011. The
six months ended
June 30,
2011
included
$66 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury and a
$74 million
, or
$0.14
per common share, non-cash charge related to the unamortized discount that was recognized upon the redemption of the TARP preferred shares.
Balance Sheet
As of
June 30
,
2012
, the Company had total assets of
$178.3 billion
and shareholders equity of
$20.6 billion
, representing
11.5%
of total assets. Both book value and tangible book value per common share increased during the quarter and were
$37.69
and
$26.02
, respectively, as of
June 30
,
2012
.
Loans
Average loans for the
second quarter
of
2012
were
$123.4 billion
, compared to average loans of
$122.5 billion
and
$114.9 billion
during the
first quarter
of
2012
and
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. On a sequential quarter basis, the $
0.8 billion
, or
1%
, growth was concentrated in commercial & industrial loans, which increased
$1.3 billion
, and high credit quality, non-guaranteed mortgage loans, which increased
$761 million
. This was partially offset by a decrease of
$625 million
in government-guaranteed mortgage loans, primarily due to the sale of approximately $500 million of such loans that occurred during the current quarter. Average loans increased
$8.4 billion
, or
7%
, over the
second quarter
of
2011
. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including commercial & industrial and government-guaranteed student and residential mortgage loans, which increased by $10 billion combined, while certain real estate-related loan categories were managed down. The reduction in real estate-related loans, together with an increase in government-guaranteed loans, resulted in improvement in the risk profile of the loan portfolio. As of
June 30
,
2012
,
10%
of the Companys loan portfolio was comprised of government-guaranteed loans, up from
8%
at the end of the
second quarter
of
2011
.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the
second quarter
of
2012
were
$125.9 billion
compared to
$125.8 billion
and
$121.9 billion
for the
first quarter
of
2012
and
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower cost accounts continued during the quarter, with a
$1.2 billion
, or
3%
, increase in demand deposits and a
$0.3 billion
, or
6%
, increase in savings accounts. These were largely offset by a
$650 million
, or
4%
, decline in time deposits and a
$539 million
, or
1%
, decline in money market account deposits.
5
Compared to the
second quarter
of
2011
, average consumer and commercial deposits increased
$4.0 billion
, or
3%
. Average demand deposits increased
$6.8 billion
, or
23%
, and savings accounts increased
$0.6 billion
, or
13%
. Time deposits declined
$2.7 billion
, or
14%
, and money market account deposits declined
$0.9 billion
, or
2%
.
Capital and Liquidity
The Companys estimated capital ratios are well above regulatory requirements with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios estimated at
10.15%
and
9.40%
, respectively. The Company redeemed $38 million of trust preferred securities during the second quarter and also announced plans to redeem an additional $1.2 billion, which it subsequently completed in July. As a result of the announcement of these redemptions, these instruments no longer qualified for Tier 1 capital as of the end of the second quarter, which accounted for 90 basis points of the decline in the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio from the prior quarter. The ratios of total average equity to total average assets and tangible equity to tangible assets were
11.51
% and
8.31
%, respectively, as of
June 30
,
2012
.
The aforementioned trust preferred securities redemptions were included as part of the Company's capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2012 in conjunction with the Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR) process. Upon completing its review of the Company's capital plan in March 2012, the Federal Reserve did not object to the trust preferred redemptions or to the Company retaining its current common stock dividend. Because the Federal Reserve objected to other proposed capital actions, the Company was required to submit a revised capital plan, which it did in June 2012. In the revised submission, the Company elected to not request an increase in the current level of its common dividend or any other return of capital, due to the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2012 and will provide the Company an opportunity to consider future capital deployment alternatives.
The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity provided in the form of its client deposit base and other available funding resources, as well as the portfolio of cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter, with declines in early-stage delinquencies, net charge-offs,
nonperforming loans, and nonperforming assets.
Nonperforming loans declined again this quarter and totaled
$2.5 billion
as of
June 30
,
2012
. Relative to the
first quarter
of
2012
, the
$191 million
, or
7
%, decline occurred across all loan categories, most prominently in commercial construction, residential construction, and commercial real estate loans. During the second quarter, the Company sold the nonperforming residential loans that were moved to held for sale during the prior quarter; the sales price was similar to the carrying value of these loans as of March 31, 2012. Compared to
June 30
,
2011
, nonperforming loans declined
$1.2 billion
, or
32
%, with declines across all loan categories, most significantly in commercial loans and non-guaranteed mortgages. At the end of the
second quarter
of
2012
, the percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was
1.97%
, down by
19
and
117
basis points from the
first quarter
of
2012
and
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. Other real estate owned totaled
$331 million
at the end of the current quarter, down
19%
on a sequential quarter basis and down
31
% since
June 30
,
2011
.
Net charge-offs were
$350 million
in the current quarter compared to
$422 million
for the prior quarter and
$505 million
for the
second quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter decline was largely driven by nonguaranteed mortgages, home equity, and commercial real estate. The prior year decline was widespread across loan categories, most notably in commercial & industrial, commercial construction, and home equity. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was
1.14%
, a reduction of
24
basis points and
62
basis points from the
first quarter
of
2012
and
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The provision for credit losses was
$300 million
, down by
$17 million
and
$92 million
from the prior quarter and the
second quarter
of
2011
, respectively.
As of
June 30
,
2012
, the allowance for loan losses was
$2.3 billion
and represented
1.85
% of total loans, down
seven
basis points from
March 31
,
2012
. The
$48 million
decline in the allowance for loan losses during the
second quarter
of
2012
was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality, partially offset by growth in the loan portfolio.
Early stage delinquencies decreased
seven basis points
to 0.97% from the end of the
first quarter
of
2012
. The
6
decline was primarily due to improvement in the residential portfolio, driven by non-guaranteed residential mortgages, home equity products, and construction loans. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.51%, a decline of eight basis points from
March 31
,
2012
.
Accruing restructured loans totaled
$2.7 billion
, and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled
$0.7 billion
as of
June 30
,
2012
, both declining modestly from the prior quarter. $3.0 billion of restructured loans related to residential loans, while $0.3 billion were commercial loans.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the
8
availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

The fully taxable-equivalent(FTE) basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiarys federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiarys income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Companys performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
7
SunTrust presents a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.

This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrusts performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided within or in the appendix of this presentation. In this presentation, net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, and ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments.

This presentation contains forward-looking statements. Any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, goals, targets, initiatives, potentially, probably, projects, outlook or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as may, will, should, would, and could.
