Item 8.01 Other Events.
From time to time, including in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the "Annual Report"), SunTrust Banks, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") indicates that it determines its business segments based on, among other things, the manner in which financial information is evaluated by management. In the Annual Report, the Company reported its results of operations through six business segments: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Corporate and Investment Banking, Mortgage, and Wealth and Investment Management, with the remaining operations recorded in Corporate Other and Treasury. During the first quarter of 2012, the Company changed its basis of presentation from six segments to the following three segments: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remaining operations recorded in Corporate Other. The revised segment structure was established in conjunction with organizational changes made throughout the Company that were announced during the fourth quarter of 2011 and implemented in the first quarter of 2012. Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
This Current Report on Form 8-K and the exhibits hereto update the business segment information presented in the Annual Report only to the extent this information is impacted by the revised business segment reporting structure. Portions of the following items from the Annual Report have been updated to reflect the revised business segment structure:
All updates to the Annual Report relate solely to the presentation of segment-specific disclosures on a basis consistent with how management currently evaluates the results of the segments. The revised reporting structure did not impact the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss), Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is presented as of December 31, 2011 and other than as indicated above, has not been updated to reflect financial results subsequent to that date or any other changes since the date of the Annual Report.

Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, targets, initiatives, potentially, probably, projects, outlook or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as may, will, should, would, and could. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management.

Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Item 1A of Part I of this report and include risks discussed in this MD&A and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients

could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.
INTRODUCTION
We are one of the nations largest commercial banking organizations and our headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Our principal banking subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses through its branches located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Within our geographic footprint, we operated under six business segments during 2011 and 2010: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CRE, CIB, Mortgage, and W&IM, with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. During the first quarter of 2012, we revised our segment structure from six segments to three: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See additional discussion of this change within the "Business Segments" and "Business Segment Results" sections of this Item 7, and Note 21, Business Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition to deposit, credit, and trust and investment services offered by the Bank, our other subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, credit-related insurance, asset management, securities brokerage, capital market services, and credit-related insurance.
This MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. When we refer to SunTrust, the Company, we, our and us in this narrative, we mean SunTrust Banks, Inc. and subsidiaries (consolidated). In the MD&A, net interest income and the net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on an FTE and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. Additionally, we present certain non-U.S. GAAP metrics to assist investors in understanding managements view of particular financial measures, as well as, to align presentation of these financial measures with peers in the industry who may also provide a similar presentation. Reconcilements for all non-U.S. GAAP measures are provided below in Tables 41 and 42.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Economic and regulatory
The economic recovery remained slow and uneven during 2011, with many economic indicators having only improved modestly or remaining unchanged to levels seen at the end of 2010. Unemployment remained high, the U.S. housing market continued to
2
show signs of weakness, and consumer confidence remained low. Unemployment remained above 9% for a majority of the year, but improved to slightly below 9% during the fourth quarter. The U.S. housing market continued to be weak as evidenced by the large inventory of foreclosed or distressed properties, home prices remaining under pressure, construction on new single-family homes remaining at historically low levels, and uncertainty about future home prices causing sales of existing homes to remain weak. Consumer confidence was stagnant throughout the year and ended 2011 at a level comparable to the end of 2010, as consumer spending increased at only a moderate pace due in part to inflationary pressures during the year that included elevated commodity prices. Additionally, the financial markets witnessed high levels of volatility during 2011 due to the economic uncertainty, the long-term U.S. debt downgrade by S&P, and the European sovereign debt crisis. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding exposure to sovereign debt of European countries experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. See additional discussion of European debt exposure in "Other Market Risk" in this MD&A.
Amidst these challenging economic conditions, domestic and abroad, the Federal Reserve indicated in January 2012 that it expects to maintain key interest rates at exceptionally low levels, at least through late 2014. Additionally, the Federal Reserve continues to conduct accommodative monetary policy through the maintenance of large portfolios of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds and agency MBS. As of the end of 2011, the Federal Reserve held approximately $2.6 trillion of such securities. The Federal Reserve is pursuing these policies to stimulate the economy in light of its January 2012 outlook for moderate real GDP growth, a high unemployment rate, and modest consumer price inflation in 2012.
Regulatory and financial reform continued in 2011, as regulatory agencies proposed and finalized numerous rules during the year, some of which became effective in 2011 and others that will begin to impact us in 2012 and beyond. In 2011, the FDIC finalized its rules related to the calculation of banks' deposit insurance assessment that were effective beginning in the second quarter of 2011. The rules required banks to base the deposit insurance calculation on our total average assets less average tangible equity, rather than based only on domestic deposits. In addition, the FDIC revised the overall pricing structure for large banks, which resulted in assessment rates being affected by specific risk characteristics, such as asset concentrations, liquidity, and asset quality. The impact of these rules has caused our regulatory expenses to increase during the year by
13%
. During the year, we expanded our deposit product offerings, in response to revisions to Regulation Q, that became effective in the third quarter, to include payment of interest on business DDAs. As expected, the interest paid on these products was nominal, and we expect that to continue while the low rate environment exists. Conversely, during the fourth quarter of 2011, the Federal Reserve's final rules related to debit card interchange fees became effective. The debit card interchange rules limit the amount of interchange fee income that can be received for electronic debit transactions. When comparing the fourth quarter interchange revenue to the third quarter, we experienced a decrease of $44 million, and as such, continue to believe going forward, the estimated impact of this rule may decrease our interchange revenue by about 50%, or approximately $50 million per quarter. We continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximately $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Regulation E (implemented in 2010) and rules related to debit card interchange fees. These mitigating actions are expected to begin impacting revenue over the course of 2012 and into 2013, and inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide. See additional discussion in the Noninterest Income section of this MD&A. During the fourth quarter, a joint agency proposal was presented for implementation of the Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act related to increased regulation of derivatives and proprietary trading. While the rule remains in the formulative stage, based on the current proposal, we do not expect a material impact to our operations when it becomes effective in the third quarter of 2012.
In 2011, the Federal Reserve conducted a horizontal review of the nation's largest mortgage loan servicers, including us. Following this review, we and other servicers entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. We describe the Consent Order in Note
20
, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. See also, Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10-K and "Nonperforming Assets" in this MD&A. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and then make any appropriate remediation, reimbursement, or adjustment. Our work required to comply with the Federal Reserves Consent Order is continuing. We currently anticipate modest increases in certain expenses, namely personnel and consulting, as we implement and comply with the provisions of the Consent Order.
We are actively evaluating other proposed rules and regulations, and as they emerge from the various stages of implementation and promulgation, we expect to be in a position to comply with new requirements and take appropriate actions as warranted.
Capital
During 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR for the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted. As a result, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including issuing $1.0 billion of common stock and $1.0 billion of senior debt. In addition, we used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase $3.5 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and $1.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP in November and December, 2008. The repurchase of the preferred stock eliminated approximately $265 million
3
in annual preferred dividend payments and discount accretion that has been negatively affecting our earnings the past two years. Additionally, by keeping our shareholders best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient and deliberate approach to the repayment of the U.S. government's TARP investment, we believe that we successfully lessened the impact to our shareholders by issuing less common stock than what would have been required had we chosen to repay earlier. The Federal Reserve now requires annual CCAR submissions and is currently reviewing our recent submission made on January 9, 2012.
Our capital remained strong at
December 31, 2011
, and the level of common equity was significantly bolstered as a result of the successful common equity raise in the first quarter of 2011, as well as retained earnings growth. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio increased to
9.22%
compared to
8.08%
at
December 31, 2010
. Meanwhile, as a result of the change in our equity mix due to the repurchase of the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury and repurchase of approximately $400 million of trust preferred securities during the year, as well as the impact of loan growth on RWA, our Tier 1 capital ratio declined to
10.90%
, compared to
13.67%
at
December 31, 2010
. At
December 31, 2010
, our Tier 1 capital ratio, excluding preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, was 10.08%. Our total capital ratio at
December 31, 2011
was
13.67%
compared to
16.54%
at
December 31, 2010
. Overall, our capital remains strong and well above the requirements to be considered well capitalized according to current and proposed regulatory standards.
Consistent with our desire to take actions that will positively benefit our shareholders, we made decisions during the year that increased the return of capital to our shareholders. First, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.05 per share for the third and fourth quarters. Second, when the U.S. Treasury auctioned our common stock warrants in October, we repurchased and retired approximately 4 million of the 17.9 million common stock warrants auctioned. Looking ahead, upon completion of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process in early 2012, we will evaluate additional actions to further increase the return of capital to shareholders in 2012. See additional discussion of our liquidity and capital position in the Liquidity Risk and Capital Resources sections of this MD&A.
Financial performance
While 2011 presented a challenging operating environment, we ended the year with significantly better momentum than when it started and achieved several milestones in our transformation to operate more efficiently and effectively in the new environment. During 2011, EPS increased meaningfully, we paid back the U.S. government's TARP investment, low-cost deposits were at record highs, we continued to change the risk composition of our loan portfolio in favor of lower risk loans while growing total loans, credit quality steadily improved during the year, capital ratios remained strong, and we launched an all-encompassing review of our operating expenses with a goal of eliminating $300 million in annual expenses by the end of 2013. These efforts, coupled with our continued focus on serving our clients and managing our core business to drive improved bottom line results, as well as improved credit quality, resulted in significant improvement of earnings during
2011
.
Net income available to common shareholders during the year of
$495 million
, or
$0.94
per average common diluted share, compares favorably to a net loss available to common shareholders of
$87 million
, or
($0.18)
per average common diluted share during
2010
and a net loss available to common shareholders of
$1.7 billion
, or
($3.98)
per average common diluted share during
2009
. Results in 2011 were driven by lower provision for credit losses, higher net interest income, and the reduction of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury after repayment of the U.S. government's TARP investment in March. Results during
2010
and
2009
were driven by higher provision for credit losses, higher interest expense, and the payment of preferred dividends to the U.S. Treasury. During the
year
s ended
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, improved credit quality resulted in the decrease of
43%
and
35%
in our provision for credit losses compared to the
year
s ended
December 31, 2010
and
2009
, respectively, which was a significant driver of the increase in our net income/(loss) available to common shareholders. As credit quality continues to improve, the impact to net income available to common shareholders due to lower provisions for credit losses is expected to be less substantial in future periods.
Our results have improved and progress is being made for further improvement, but our performance is not where we would like for it to be, and therefore we announced specific initiatives during 2011 that are aimed at improving our performance in the future. Our PPG is the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe will improve efficiency and, over time will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to targeted levels below 60%, as will the expected normalization in credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase provision as the economic environment improves. The three main components of the PPG expense program are focused in the areas of strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies, and operations staff and support. We have made significant progress in our planning for PPG, and implementation is underway on many of its initiatives that should result in $300 million in annual expense savings, with the majority of the actions to be accomplished during 2012 and the remainder in 2013. At the end of 2011, $75 million in annualized savings had been realized with a majority coming from the strategic supply management area as a result of actions taken related to vendor costs, demand management, and discretionary spending. Initiatives in the consumer bank area and operations support and staff also contributed to the savings realized in 2011, primarily due to refining the branch network and staffing models and through consolidations and shared services related to certain operational staff and support teams. By the end of 2012, we anticipate realization of at least $240 million in annualized savings through our PPG expense program, with the remainder realized by December 2013.
4
Our asset quality metrics improved again this year, with improvements in the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, NPLs, nonperforming assets, and early stage delinquencies. At
December 31, 2011
, the ALLL ratio remains elevated by historical standards at
2.01%
of total loans and declined
57
basis points and
75
basis points compared to
December 31, 2010
and
2009
, respectively, in part due to decreases in the ALLL during 2011 and 2010, coupled with an increase in loans. The improvement in credit quality drove a
44%
and
62%
decrease in the provision for loan losses compared to
2010
and
2009
, respectively. Additionally, net charge-offs declined
29%
and
37%
compared to
2010
and
2009
, respectively. We currently expect net charge-offs to be stable to modestly down during the first quarter of 2012. Total NPLs continued the downward trend that began in
2010
, with a decline of
29%
from
December 31, 2010
as a result of reduced inflows into nonaccrual combined with our problem loan resolution efforts. NPLs are also down
46%
compared to
December 31, 2009
. We expect a continuation of the 2011 trend in NPLs with additional declines in the first quarter of 2012. OREO declined
20%
during the year and
23%
compared to
December 31, 2009
. The declines since year end 2010 and 2009 were the result of disposition of properties once we had clear title, coupled with a slow down of inflows. Our restructured loan portfolio is relatively unchanged in total compared to
December 31, 2010
, with a decrease in the nonaccruing loans offset by an increase in the accruing loan population. However, the restructured loan population has grown by
42%
since
December 31, 2009
as a result of our efforts for clients who were experiencing financial difficulty to restructure their loan to avoid foreclosure. As a result, our accruing restructured loan portfolio, which is primarily mortgage and consumer loans, increased by
8%
and
72%
compared to
December 31, 2010
and
2009
, respectively. However, the portfolio continued to exhibit strong payment performance with 88% current on principal and interest payments at
December 31, 2011
. Early stage delinquencies, a leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, remained stable this year, however, when excluding government-guaranteed loan delinquencies, early stage delinquencies declined 22 basis points from
December 31, 2010
. This decline was a result of our efforts to reduce risk in the portfolio during the year as evidenced by a decline in higher-risk loans coupled with the growth of government-guaranteed loans. See additional discussion of credit and asset quality in the Loans, Allowance for Credit Losses, Nonperforming Assets, and Restructured Loans, sections of this MD&A.
Average loans increased by
$2.4 billion
, or
2%
, during the year, with increases in commercial & industrial and consumer loans being partially offset by decreases in residential and commercial real estate loans. The total average loan balances have only increased modestly from 2010, but our risk profile has improved noticeably as we made progress on diversifying the portfolio and reducing risk. Our efforts in 2011 resulted in a decline in certain higher-risk loan portfolios, which have been offset by targeted growth in certain lower-risk portfolios, such as government-guaranteed loans. As a result, our guaranteed loans represent
11%
of the portfolio as of
December 31, 2011
compared to
8%
at
December 31, 2010
. A major driver of the increase in government guaranteed loans has been the purchase of guaranteed loan portfolios. While our decision to purchase government guaranteed loans has benefited us in the current economic cycle, as the economy grows and organic loan growth increases, we expect slower growth of our government guaranteed portfolios in the future. Additionally, despite continued soft overall loan demand, we remain committed to providing home financing in the communities we serve and are focused on extending credit to qualified borrowers during this uncertain economic landscape. To that end, during the
year
ended
December 31, 2011
, we extended approximately $84 billion in new loan originations, commitments, and renewals of commercial, residential, and consumer loans to our clients.
Client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory, reaching record highs during 2011, and the positive shift in deposit mix continued with lower-cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher-cost deposits. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased
5%
during 2011, led by average balance increases of
19%
in lower cost noninterest-bearing DDAs, predominantly offset by declines in higher cost CDs of
17%
. Due to the growth seen in core deposits, our liquidity has been enhanced, enabling us to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our funding costs. While we continue to believe that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients desires for having increased liquidity, we believe that we have also proactively generated this growth in both our Consumer and Wholesale business, as we have expanded the number of primary client relationships and improved our client loyalty.
Our client-focused revenue generation strategies, lower cost funding mix, and improved asset quality contributed to improved operating trends as seen in higher net interest income and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses compared to a year ago. Total revenue, on an FTE basis, declined
1%
compared to
2010
, but increased
4%
from 2009. The change compared to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in net interest income offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of lower mortgage-related income, lower service charge income, and lower securities gains. The increase compared to 2009 was due primarily to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decline in noninterest income as a result of less service charges and mortgage-related income. Net interest income, on an FTE basis, increased
4%
during 2011 and
13%
compared to 2009. The increase in net interest income was due to lower funding costs and an improved funding mix. As a result, our net interest margin increased to
3.50%
for the
year ended
December 31, 2011
from
3.38%
during the same period in
2010
, and
3.04%
during 2009. Noninterest income declined
8%
compared to
2010
, most notably due to decreases in mortgage-related income, service charge income, and lower securities gains, partially offset by higher trading income driven by higher valuation gains on our fair value debt and index-linked CDs. Compared to 2009, noninterest income declined
8%
, with increases in trading income, card fees, investment banking income, and trust income, offset by declines in mortgage-related income, service charge income, and the 2009 gain on sale of Visa share ownership. The driver for the decline in mortgage-related income compared to both earlier
5
years was primarily due to less favorable net hedge performance and lower loan production volume that resulted in lower gain on sale and fee income. Service charge income declined compared to both earlier years as a result of Regulation E changes in 2010. Noninterest expense increased
5%
during 2011, driven primarily by higher personnel costs, operating losses, regulatory costs, and potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense, partially offset by lower gains on debt extinguishment. Compared to 2009, noninterest expense decreased by
5%
primarily due to the recognition of goodwill impairment in 2009, partially offset by higher personnel costs, operating losses, and the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense in 2011. The higher personnel costs are due to the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in loss mitigation and in client service and support roles, and an increase in compensation as a result of improved revenue generation in certain businesses. The increase in the operating losses was due to increases in legal and mortgage servicing-related expenses, while the regulatory cost increases were due to the change in the FDIC assessment calculation. The mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense includes an accrual of our estimated costs to address certain mortgage servicing claims. See additional discussion of our financial performance in the Consolidated Financial Results section of this MD&A, and Note 20, "Contingencies" and Note 25, "Subsequent Event," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K related to the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense.
Line of Business Highlights
Many of our core businesses demonstrated positive trends during 2011, helping to offset some of the regulatory and environmental challenges we encountered. Our strategic priorities to drive higher profitability from a more diverse platform encompass growing consumer market and wallet share, diversifying the loan portfolio, optimizing our business mix, and improving expense efficiency. The key to accomplishing these priorities is driven by our core performance within each line of business.
Our Corporate Other line of business encompasses all remaining areas of the Company and is key to our asset and liability performance. This line of business has maintained an intense focus on balance sheet management and positioned us for prolonged low interest rates due to a high level of discipline around our asset and liability pricing. This discipline has benefited our margin in 2011, which helped drive the
$443 million
in net income in this line of business.

Net Interest Income/Margin
Net interest income, on an FTE basis, was $
5.2 billion
during 2011, an increase of
$209 million
, up
4%
, from
2010
. This increase was predominantly driven by a continued positive trend in net interest margin, which increased by
12
basis points to
3.50%
in
2011
from
3.38%
in 2010. Earning asset yields declined by
13
basis points to
4.26%
, compared with
4.39%
during
2010
, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by
30
basis points over the same period. Net interest margin increased, predominantly due to the growth in lower-cost deposits, specifically DDA and money market accounts, along with a decrease in higher-cost time deposits and long-term debt. We expect the net interest margin to decline modestly in the first quarter of 2012, as earning asset yield compression is expected as a result of the continued low rate environment.
Average earning assets increased by
$0.6 billion
, or less than 1%, compared with
2010
. The increase was predominantly due to an increase in average loans, which was up by
$2.4 billion
, or
2%
. The increase in loans was primarily attributable to increases of
$3.5 billion
, or
11%
, in commercial loans, primarily driven by our large corporate borrowers,
$2.2 billion
, or
29%
, in consumer-
8
indirect loans, driven by purchases of high quality auto loan portfolios, and
$1.4 billion
, or
25%
, of consumer-direct loans related to an increase in government-guaranteed student loans. These increases were partially offset by declines of
$1.7 billion
, or
12%
, in commercial real estate and by
$1.3 billion
, or
38%
, in real estate construction, both predominantly as a result of our targeted efforts to reduce exposure to these higher-risk loans, and by a
$1.2 billion
, or
25%
, decline in nonaccrual loans, primarily commercial nonaccrual loans, and a
$0.6 billion
, or
4%
, decrease in real estate home equity lines. Securities AFS also decreased by
$1.3 billion
, down
5%
, predominantly due to the sale of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities of
$4.4 billion
, partially offset by purchases of agency MBS and federal agency securities. See additional discussion in the Securities Available for Sale section in this MD&A for more information on the repositioning of our securities AFS portfolio. LHFS declined by
$1.0 billion
, or
32%
, as a result of a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume.
Our loan portfolio yielded
4.58%
for the year, down
16
basis points from 2010. The yield decline was predominantly related to higher balances in the consumer-indirect loan portfolio that included high-quality loans acquired at lower rates and the real estate 1-4 family loan portfolio, which was driven by run-off of higher rate loans that we replaced with lower rate government guaranteed loans. We utilize interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The largest notional position of these swaps are receive fixed/pay floating interest rate swaps that convert a portion of our commercial loan portfolio from floating rates, based on LIBOR, to fixed rates. As of
December 31, 2011
, the outstanding notional balance of swaps was
$14.9 billion
, which qualified as cash flow hedges on variable rate commercial loans, compared with
$15.9 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
. Swap income remained relatively stable at
$626 million
during
2011
compared with
$617 million
during 2010. Reflected in our swap income during 2011, was approximately $202 million of income related to terminated swaps. Beginning in the second quarter of 2012, the income from certain swaps that were previously terminated will decline by approximately $35 million per quarter. In the absence of additions or terminations, our notional balance of swaps will begin to mature in the second quarter of 2013 with remaining maturities through early 2017. The average maturity of our swap notional balances at December 31, 2011 was 3.4 years. The U.S. government recently announced a plan that could potentially impact prepayments and borrower payment caps related to a portion of our student loan portfolio.  Some of our portfolio was acquired at a discount and prepayments may result in additional net interest income; however, the impact of the plan is not expected to have a material effect on our net interest income.
Average interest-bearing liabilities declined by
$2.5 billion
, or
2%
, from
2010
, predominantly as a result of a
$4.0 billion
, or
17%
, decline in higher-cost time deposits and a
$2.6 billion
, or
16%
, decline in long-term debt. The declines in time deposits and long-term debt were partially offset by an increase in lower-cost client deposits, as compared to the same period during 2010. Total average consumer and commercial deposits increased by
$5.5 billion
, or
5%
, compared with the same period during 2010. This increase was predominantly driven by a
$4.9 billion
, or
19%
, increase in demand deposits. The growth in lower-cost deposits and the decline in time deposits and wholesale funding resulted in a
30
basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities compared with the same period during 2010. The growth in lower-cost deposits was the result of marketing campaigns, competitive pricing and clients increased preference for more liquid products.
During
2011
, the interest rate environment was characterized by a flattening of the yield curve versus
2010
, as rates at the long end of the curve declined. More specifically, the Fed funds target rate averaged 0.25%, unchanged from last year. The Prime rate averaged 3.25%, unchanged from
2010
. During 2011, benchmark rates were as follows compared with 2010; one-month LIBOR averaged 0.23%, a decrease of 4 basis points, three-month LIBOR averaged 0.34%, unchanged from
2010
, five-year swaps averaged 1.79%, a decrease of 37 basis points, and ten-year swaps averaged 2.90%, a decrease of 35 basis points.
Foregone Interest
Foregone interest income from NPLs reduced net interest margin by
15
basis points during 2011, compared with
20
basis points during 2010, as average nonaccrual loans decreased by
$1.2 billion
during the period ended
December 31, 2011
. See additional discussion of our expectations for future levels of credit quality in the Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets sections of this MD&A. Tables 1 and 2 contain more detailed information concerning average balances, yields earned, and rates paid.
 
9
Noninterest income decreased by $
308 million
, or
8%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
, due to lower mortgage-related income, lower deposit service charges due primarily to Regulation E, and lower net gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by higher trading income/(loss), trust and investment management income, and retail investment services income.
Mortgage servicing related income decreased by $
134 million
, or
37%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The decline was due to less favorable net hedge performance and lower MSR valuations resulting from an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to increased refinancing activity. Furthermore, during the fourth quarter of 2011, mortgage servicing related income was impacted by a decline in fair value of MSRs of $38 million due to the HARP 2.0 program, which is anticipated to result in higher refinance activity. See the Other Market Risk section of this MD&A for further information regarding the risks pertaining to the valuation of our MSRs. The remaining decrease is due to a decline in service fees attributable to a decrease in the servicing portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, the balance of mortgages serviced was
$157.8 billion
compared with
$167.2 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
.
Mortgage production related (loss)/income was a loss of
$5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with income of
$127 million
for the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The decline was predominantly due to declines in loan production volume. Loan production volume of $23.1 billion in 2011 was down $6.2 billion, or 21%, from the prior year, coupled with lower margins, which resulted in lower gain on sale and fee income. Additionally, the mortgage repurchase provision for the year ended December 31, 2011 was
$502 million
compared with
$456 million
for the year ended
December 31, 2010
, an increase of $46 million due to the increase in agency-related repurchase requests (see below for additional discussion). The reserves for mortgage repurchases was
$320 million
as of December 31, 2011, an increase of $55 million from prior year.
Repurchase requests can vary significantly from period to period based on the timing of requests from the GSEs. Mortgage repurchase demands were elevated during 2011 compared to 2010. The majority of our demands are from loans in the 2006-2008 vintages that have been 120 days past due at some point in their life cycle. In addition, the majority of the demands that we have received have been from loans that were delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria does not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we will receive demands could be stabilizing, given that any performing loans from the 2006-2008 vintages have now been outstanding beyond 36 months. This pattern is expected to result in a decline in the mortgage repurchase provision in the second half of 2012.
However, we believe that demands will continue to be volatile and may remain elevated in 2012. A continued sluggish economy and any further declines in housing values could impact the future amount of demands. If demands do not decline from levels seen in the latter half of 2011, we may see an increase in the repurchase provision in 2012, which would result in lower mortgage production income. As a result of the continued uncertainty and our expectation of elevated demands in the near term, our mortgage repurchase reserve remains at historically high levels. For additional information on the mortgage repurchase reserve, see Note
18
, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this MD&A, and "Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K.
10
Service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $
75 million
, or
10%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The decrease was attributable to Regulation E changes and a voluntary decision to eliminate fees on transactions where the overdrafted amount is small, as well as reducing the maximum number of daily overdraft fees charged to our clients. The voluntary changes and the Regulation E impact began during the third quarter of 2010.
Net securities gains decreased by $
74 million
, or
39%
, compared with the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011 and 2010, we repositioned the securities AFS portfolio in response to market conditions, which caused sales and the resulting gains. See Securities Available for Sale in this MD&A for further discussion regarding our repositioning activity.
Trading income/(loss) increased by $
75 million
, or
43%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increase was primarily attributable to valuation gains on our fair value debt, net of hedges, and index-linked CDs of $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared with valuation losses of $25 million for the year
December 31, 2010
driven by the widening of financial institutions' credit spreads amidst market volatility during the year. Additionally, we experienced lower valuation losses associated with the deterioration of collateral on previously securitized loans. These were partially offset by lower valuation gains on illiquid securities and a decline in core trading revenue due to market volatility during the second half of the year caused by the U.S. debt downgrade by S&P and the low interest rate environment.
Trust and investment management income increased by $
28 million
, or
6
%, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increase was primarily due to higher revenue from our RidgeWorth mutual fund complex and higher market valuations on managed equity assets.
Retail investment services income increased by $
25 million
, or
12%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increases were driven by higher recurring brokerage revenue and annuity income.
Other charges and fees decreased by $27 million, or 5%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2010. Premium income related to reinsurance services declined due to paydowns in underlying loans' principal balances and the termination of contracts during the year. Fee income was also impacted by a decline in letter of credit fees due to a reduction of $1.2 billion in outstanding letters of credit.
Card fees decreased by $
5 million
, or
1%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The decline was a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of fourth quarter 2011. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing revised standards that significantly lowered the rates that can be charged on debit card transactions and prohibited network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. We estimated that this rule, effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter 2011, would reduce our debit interchange income by about 50%, or approximately $50 million per quarter prior to any mitigating actions. As a means to mitigate some of this lost revenue, we have introduced new checking account products which are aligned with clients needs and which we expect will provide additional streams of fee income. Additionally, we also expect to benefit from the discontinuation of our debit card rewards programs, actions taken to reduce the costs related to our debit card program, and the introduction of other value-added deposit product features over the next two years, which we expect will produce additional deposit fee income. Collectively, and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture 50% of the approximate $300 million of combined annual revenue loss attributable to both the newly-issued interchange fee rules and Regulation E. Inherent in this expectation is our ability to charge certain deposit-related fees for value-added services we provide.
Investment banking income increased by $
4 million
, or
1%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increase over 2010 was primarily attributable to strong syndicated finance fees, which resulted from continued market penetration. We note that investment banking income has and will continue to experience volatility due to market factors and client behavior patterns.
Other noninterest income increased by $
7 million
, or
4%
, compared with the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The increase was primarily attributable to current year gains on private equity investments and client leasing transactions.
 
11
Noninterest expense increased by
$323 million
, or
5%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The increase in expense was driven predominantly by higher operating losses, potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense, personnel and other staff, consulting and legal, and regulatory assessments. These higher costs were partially offset by a net gain on the extinguishment of debt compared to a net loss on extinguishment in 2010, as well as a decline in other real estate expense.
Operating losses increased by
$174 million
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The increase was due to compliance-related costs largely attributable to mortgage servicing and litigation expenses tied to specific claims.
The potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense was due to the accrual of our estimated costs to address certain mortgage servicing claims. See additional discussion in Note 20, "Contingencies" and Note 25, "Subsequent Event," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Personnel expenses increased by
$55 million
, or
2%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The
$130 million
, or
5%
, increase in employee compensation expense related to higher compensation from improved business performance and increases in client-facing full-time equivalent employees. The increase was largely offset by a
$75 million
, or
16%
decrease in employee benefits, predominantly due to a $60 million gain related to curtailment of our pension plan net of a discretionary 401(k) contribution. During the year we made the decision to curtail the pension plan and concurrent with the curtailment, we made a contribution to our longer-tenured teammates' 401(k) accounts.
Other staff expense increased by
$40 million
, or
73%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
, predominantly due to an increase in severance-related expenses. The severance-related expenses were associated with our PPG Expense Program. The severance-related expenses reflect the progress that we made during the year on the design and implementation of the PPG Expense Program, and we believe the expenses recorded in 2011 to be a majority of the severance expense that will be incurred over the life of the Program.
Consulting and legal expenses increased by
$36 million
, or
43%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The increase was attributable to consulting costs associated with specific business initiatives, as well as costs to address the Consent Order with the Federal Reserve. For additional information regarding the Consent Order, see Note
20
, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and the Nonperforming Assets section of this MD&A.
12
Regulatory assessments expense increased by
$35 million
, or
13%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The increase was the result of the change in the assessment base for FDIC insurance premiums that took effect at the beginning of the second quarter of 2011.
Net losses on debt extinguishment decreased by
$73 million
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. Net losses on debt extinguishment in the prior year were primarily due to early termination fees on the extinguishment of $1.7 billion in FHLB borrowings, as well as the fees paid to repurchase $750 million of our debt in a tender offer.
Other real estate expense decreased by
$36 million
, or
12%
, compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The decrease was predominantly due to less loss provisioning as sales of owned properties increased while inflows of new properties decreased. Over time, as the economic environment improves, we expect that other real estate expense will continue to improve, but will likely remain elevated compared with the levels realized prior to the economic recession.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes. For the
year ended
December 31, 2011
, the provision for income taxes was
$79 million
, resulting in an effective tax rate of
10.9%
. The effective tax rate was primarily a result of positive pre-tax earnings adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities. For the year ended
December 31, 2010
, we had an income tax benefit of
$185 million
which was primarily driven by the net favorable permanent tax items significantly exceeding positive pre-tax earnings. See additional discussion related to the provision for income taxes in Note
15
, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
LOANS
In 2010, we adopted accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of our loan portfolios and the credit reserves held against them. These disclosures are intended to 1) describe the nature of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, 2) provide information on how we analyze and assess that risk in arriving at an adequate and appropriate ALLL, and 3) explain the changes in the ALLL and reasons for those changes. Additionally, the disclosures are required to be made on a disaggregated basis by loan portfolio segment and/or by type of loan. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which we develop and document our method for determining our ALLL. Loan types are further categorizations of our portfolio segments. In conjunction with adopting the accounting guidance, we adjusted 2009 loan classifications to align with post-adoption loan classifications. While the reclassification had no effect on the carrying value of our LHFI or LHFS, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre-adoption loan classifications due to the inability to restate all prior periods under the post-adoption loan classifications.
Under the post-adoption classification, we report our loan portfolio in three segments: commercial, residential, and consumer. Loans are assigned to these segments based upon the type of borrower, collateral, and/or our underlying credit management processes. Additionally, within each segment, we have identified loan types, or classes, which further identify loans based upon common risk characteristics.
The commercial and industrial loan type includes loans secured by owner-occupied properties, corporate credit cards and other wholesale lending activities. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loan types are based on investor exposures where repayment is largely dependent upon the operation, refinance, or sale of the underlying real estate. Commercial and construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties are classified as commercial and industrial loans, as the primary source of loan repayment for owner-occupied properties is business income and not real estate operations.
Residential mortgages consist of loans secured by 1-4 family homes, mostly prime first-lien loans, both guaranteed and nonguaranteed. Residential construction loans include residential lot loans and construction-to-perm loans. Home equity products consist of equity lines of credit and closed-end equity loans that may be in either a first lien or junior lien position. At
December 31, 2011
,
30%
of our home equity products were in a first lien position and
70%
were in a junior lien position. For home equity products in a junior lien position, we service
32%
of the loans that are senior to the home equity product.
Only a small percentage of home equity lines are scheduled to convert to amortizing in 2012 and 2013, with 90% of home equity line balances scheduled to convert to amortization in 2014 or later. It should be noted that  a majority of accounts do not convert to amortizing. Based on historical trends, within 12 months of the end of their draw period, more than 75% of accounts, and approximately 65% of accounts with a balance, closed or refinanced before, or soon after converting.We perform credit management activities on home equity accounts to limit our loss exposure. These activities result in the suspension of available credit of most
13
home equity junior lien accounts when the first lien position is delinquent, including when the junior lien is still current. We do not actively monitor the first lien delinquency status on an on-going basis when we do not own or service the first lien position beyond the initial notification of the first lien becoming delinquent. However, we actively monitor refreshed credit bureau scores, which are highly sensitive to first lien mortgage delinquency, of borrowers with junior liens. At
December 31, 2011
, our home equity junior lien loss severity was approximately 90%.
The loan types comprising our consumer loan segment include guaranteed student loans, other direct, consisting primarily of private student loans, indirect, consisting of loans secured by automobiles or recreational vehicles, and credit cards.
The composition of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31 is shown in the following tables:
1
Includes
$431 million
,
$488 million
, and $437 million of loans carried at fair value at
December 31, 2011
,
2010
, and 2009, respectively.
Loans Held for Investment
Our loan growth performance was strong, with LHFI increasing
$6.5 billion
, up
6%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. Growth was driven by increases in the commercial and industrial and government-guaranteed student and guaranteed residential mortgage loans. We continued to make progress in our loan portfolio diversification strategy, as we have been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer areas, and in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction areas that we consider to be higher risk. Continuing to manage down our commercial and residential construction portfolios has resulted in a combined
$1.6 billion
decline in these portfolios during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, and a $7.8 billion decrease since the end of 2008. At the same time that we have been managing these and other higher risk balances down, we have also been reducing our risk by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. These efforts have driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. Our strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth and, if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category. Government-guaranteed loans increased this year by about $5.1 billion, and they now total $13.9 billion, or 11% of our loan portfolio.
Commercial loans increased
$2.4 billion
, up
4%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. Growth was driven by a
$4.8 billion
increase in commercial and industrial loans, largely offset by decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans. Our larger corporate borrowers drove much of the
11%
increase in commercial and industrial loans. Growth came across most industry verticals, with healthcare and energy contributing the most. Meanwhile, commercial construction loans decreased by
$1.3 billion
, down
52%
, primarily as a result of our efforts to reduce risk levels by aggressively managing existing construction exposure.
14
Residential loans remained relatively flat during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. Government-guaranteed mortgages grew $2.2 billion, up 48%, as we added to this portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2011, and thereby continued to make progress on diversifying and de-risking the overall balance sheet. We experienced declines across all other residential loan classes, especially home equity and residential construction. The overall decline was predominantly driven by payoffs, with current year net charge-offs and transfers to OREO also contributing to the decline.
Consumer loans increased
$4.0 billion
, up
25%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. Growth occurred across all consumer loan classes, with government-guaranteed student loans being the largest driver, increasing by
$2.9 billion
, up
69%
, due to portfolio acquisitions.
Loans Held for Sale
LHFS decreased
$1.1 billion
, down
33%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The decline was attributable to a reduction in closed mortgage loan volume, coupled with increased delivery volume to our LHFI portfolio.

Asset Quality
Our overall asset quality improved steadily throughout 2011, with net charge-offs, NPLs, and nonperforming assets all declining, as compared with the prior year. The total delinquency ratio remained flat during 2011 compared with December 31, 2010, but increased 13 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was due to the purchase of government-guaranteed student loan portfolios, which have higher delinquency rates, although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee. Early stage delinquencies excluding government-guaranteed loans continued to trend lower, down 22 basis points during the year, driven by improvements in nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity loans. Commercial and consumer early stage delinquencies reached relatively low levels of 0.17% and 0.68% of total loans at December 31, 2011, respectively, while residential early stage delinquencies declined to 1.38%. Any further improvement in overall delinquencies will be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment and to a lesser extent, home values.
NPLs totaled $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2011, and compared to December 31, 2010, NPLs decreased $1.2 billion, down 29%. Approximately $1.0 billion of the overall decline came from commercial construction NPLs as a result of continuing risk mitigation activities. We continue to be proactive in our credit monitoring and management processes to provide early warning of problem loans. For example, we use an expanded liquidity and contingency analysis to provide a thorough view of borrowers' capacity and their ability to service their debt obligations. We also have strict limits and exposure caps on specific projects and borrowers for risk diversification. Due to the lack of new construction projects and the completion of many that were previously started, the aggregate amount of interest reserves that we are obligated to fund has declined from prior periods and are not considered significant relative to total loans outstanding.
Overall asset quality trends for residential loans showed improvement throughout 2011. For the year, net charge-offs decreased by over $800 million, or about 30%, with residential loans being the largest driver, contributing $459 million towards the decline. Residential NPLs also declined modestly, down 11%, driven by improvements in residential construction and nonguaranteed mortgages. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we expect to see a further decline in NPLs, with net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down.
Net charge-offs and early stage delinquencies for the home equity portfolio declined, while NPLs remained relatively stable, showing slight decreases during the year. Runoff in this portfolio has been concentrated in the higher LTV loans, where a very limited amount of production has occurred during 2011. While these higher LTV loans have additional availability on their home equity lines at
December 31, 2011
, 99% of already outstanding borrowings on the lines are accruing and current on interest and principal.
Commercial net charge-offs declined $325 million during 2011, down 33% compared to the prior year, led by decreases in our commercial construction and commercial and industrial portfolios. Given the stresses in the commercial real estate market, we have performed a thorough analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio to identify loans with an increased risk of default. We believe that our investor-owned portfolio is appropriately diversified by borrower, geography, and property type. We typically underwrite commercial projects to credit standards that are more stringent than historical commercial MBS guidelines. Where appropriate, we have taken prudent actions with our client to strengthen our credit position. These actions reflect market terms and structures and are intended to improve the clients financial ability to perform. Impaired loans are assessed relative to the clients and guarantors, if any, ability to service the debt, the loan terms, and the value of the property. These factors are taken into consideration when formulating our ALLL through our credit risk rating and/or specific reserving processes. For the consumer portfolios, asset quality modestly improved, including early stage delinquencies, excluding guaranteed student loans, that declined during the year. Additionally, the level of nonperforming consumer loans and net charge-offs declined compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
We believe that our loan portfolio is well diversified by product, client, and geography throughout our footprint. However, our loan portfolio may be exposed to certain concentrations of credit risk which exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, certain loan products, or certain regions of the country.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
At
December 31, 2011
, the allowance for credit losses was
$2.5 billion
, which consists of both the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, as well as the Allowance for Credit Losses section within Critical Accounting Policies in this MD&A for further information regarding our ALLL accounting policy, determination, and allocation. As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types in 2010 had no effect on total loan charge-offs and loan recoveries, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre-adoption charge-off and recovery classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the post-adoption classifications.
17
A rollforward of our allowance for credit losses, along with our summarized credit loss experience for the years ended December 31, is shown in the tables below:
1
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Given the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
2
The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
3
$433 million
,
$492 million
, and $449 million, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans in the calculation.
4
Excluding government-guaranteed loans of
$13.9 billion
,
$8.8 billion
, and $3.7 billion, respectively, from period-end loans in the calculation results in ratios of
2.27%
,
2.79%
, and 2.84%, respectively.
5
$25 million
,
$28 million
, and $46 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.
Charge-offs
Net charge-offs declined
$815 million
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, down
29%
compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The decline in net charge-offs occurred across each segment of our loan portfolio and was particularly notable for residential loans. As a percentage of average loans, net charge-offs were
1.75%
and
2.51%
during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The improvements in net charge-offs were the result of improved asset quality. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we expect to see a stable to modest decline in net charge-offs from fourth quarter levels.
Provision for Credit Losses
The total provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan losses as well as the provision for unfunded commitments. The provision for loan losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate an appropriate and adequate ALLL. For the
year ended December 31, 2011
, the provision for loan losses declined
$1.2 billion
, down
44%
compared with the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The decline in the provision for loan losses was attributable to significantly lower net charge-offs and the decline in the ALLL resulting from improved credit quality.
18
For the
year ended December 31, 2011
, the benefit for unfunded commitments was
$10 million
, compared with
$57 million
for the
year ended December 31, 2010
. The benefit for the year was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers.
1
Amount removed from the ALLL related to our election to record $4.1 billion of residential mortgages at fair value.
2
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, SunTrust began recording the provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Given the immateriality of this provision, prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
3
Prior to 2009, borrower misrepresentation and denied insurance claim losses were recorded as operating losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). These credit-related operating losses totaled $160 million and $78 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009, credit-related operating losses charged-off against previously established reserves within other liabilities total $195 million.
4
For this ratio,
$433 million
, $492 million, $449 million, $270 million, and $221 million at December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, of LHFI carried at fair value were excluded from period-end loans.
5
$25 million
,
$28 million
, $46 million, $46 million, and $172 million, respectively, of NPLs carried at fair value were excluded from NPLs in the calculation.
19
ALLL and Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types in 2010 had no effect on total loans or total ALLL, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre-adoption ALLL by loan segment classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the post-adoption classifications.
The allocation of our ALLL by loan segment at December 31 is shown in the tables below:
 
 
1
Beginning in 2008, the unallocated reserve is reflected in our homogeneous pool estimates.
The ALLL decreased by
$517 million
, down
17%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, with commercial, residential, and consumer loans-related ALLL declining
$339 million
,
$144 million
, and
$34 million
, respectively. The decrease in ALLL was commensurate with the continued improvement in credit quality of each segment as evidenced by lower delinquency rates, reductions in higher-risk balances, and lower NPLs. Our risk profile continues to improve, as the amount of certain higher-risk loans continue to decline, while lower-risk government guaranteed loans grew to
11%
of the portfolio. The variables most impacting the ALLL continue to be unemployment, residential real estate property values, and the variability and relative strength of the housing market. At this point in the cycle, we expect the ALLL to trend at a pace consistent with improvements in credit quality and overall economic conditions. As of
December 31, 2011
, the allowance to period-end loans ratio was
2.01%
, down from
2.58%
at
December 31, 2010
, consistent with our continued actions to reduce the risk of our loan portfolio during the period coupled with an increase in total loans during 2011. The ratio of the ALLL to total NPLs improved to
85%
as of
December 31, 2011
from
73%
as of
December 31, 2010
. The improvement in this ratio was primarily attributable to the
$1.2 billion
decrease in NPLs, partially offset by the decline in ALLL.
The reserve for unfunded commitments was
$48 million
as of
December 31, 2011
, a decrease of
$10 million
, down
17%
compared to
$58 million
at
December 31, 2010
. The decrease in the reserve was attributed to improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate borrowers.
20
NONPERFORMING ASSETS
As previously noted, while the reclassification of our loan types in 2010 had no effect on total NPLs, SEC regulations require us, in some instances, to present five years of comparable data where trend information may be deemed relevant, in which case we have provided the pre-adoption NPL classifications due to the inability to restate prior periods under the post-adoption classifications.
The following tables present our nonperforming assets at December 31:
1
Does not include foreclosed real estate related to loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed. The receivable amount related to proceeds due from FHA or the VA totaled
$132 million
,
$195 million
, and $113 million at
December 31, 2011
,
2010
, and 2009, respectively.
2
Includes $979 million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from Ginnie Mae and classified as held for sale at December 31, 2009.
3
Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.
Nonperforming assets decreased
$1.4 billion
, down
29%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The decrease was predominantly attributable to a
$1.2 billion
reduction in NPLs as a result of our problem loan resolution efforts. Real estate related loans comprise a significant portion of our overall nonperforming assets as a result of the U.S. housing market correction. The amount of time necessary to obtain control of residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, has remained elevated due to delays in the foreclosure process. These delays may impact the resolution of real estate related loans within the nonperforming
21
assets portfolio. Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial loans, as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced, while the commercial and industrial loans have generally performed well. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we expect the recent quarterly trends to continue, with a continued decline in NPLs.
Nonperforming Loans
Nonperforming commercial loans decreased
$961 million
, down
51%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, driven by a
$671 million
decrease in commercial construction NPLs and a
$236 million
decrease in commercial and industrial NPLs. We expect NPLs to continue to decline in the first quarter of 2012; however, we continue to expect some variability in inflows of commercial real estate NPLs as we move through the current commercial real estate cycle.
Nonperforming residential loans declined
$238 million
, down
11%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, largely due to a
$151 million
decrease in nonguaranteed residential mortgage NPLs, along with a
$70 million
decline in residential construction NPLs. The
$151 million
decrease was partially attributable to the reclassification of certain nonperforming residential mortgages as held for sale to reflect our intention to sell these mortgages. We recorded an incremental charge-off of
$10 million
in the first quarter in connection with the decision to transfer and sell these mortgages. Approximately
$34 million
of these reclassified NPLs were sold during the second quarter; the remaining
$13 million
were transferred back to LHFI as they were no longer deemed marketable for sale. The remaining decrease was attributable to lower net charge-offs and inflows of NPLs. We expect some variability in inflows of nonperforming residential loans during 2012 related to mortgage loan repurchases from investors. See additional discussion of mortgage loan repurchases in Note
18
, "Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Nonperforming consumer loans decreased
$8 million
, down
23%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, largely as a result of a
$5 million
decrease in indirect consumer NPLs. The decrease was driven by net charge-offs of existing nonperforming consumer loans during the year, largely offset by the migration of delinquent consumer loans to nonaccrual status.
Interest income on consumer and residential nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Interest income on commercial nonaccrual loans is not recognized until after the principal has been reduced to zero. We recognized
$34 million
and
$39 million
of interest income related to nonaccrual loans for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of
$246 million
and
$340 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, would have been recognized.
Other Nonperforming Assets
OREO decreased
$117 million
, down
20%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The decline consisted of net decreases of
$124 million
in residential homes and
$24 million
in residential construction related properties, partially offset by a
$31 million
increase in commercial properties. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, sales of OREO resulted in proceeds of
$619 million
and
$769 million
, respectively, and net losses on sales of OREO of
$4 million
and
$25 million
, respectively, inclusive of valuation reserves, primarily attributed to lots and land evaluated under the pooled approach. Sales of OREO and the related gains or losses are highly dependent on our disposition strategy and buyer opportunities. See Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information. Gains and losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other real estate expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Geographically, most of our OREO properties are located in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Residential properties and land comprised
38%
and
40%
, respectively, of OREO; the remainder is related to commercial and other properties. Upon foreclosure, the values of these properties were reevaluated and, if necessary, written down to their then-current estimated value, less costs to sell. Further declines in home prices could result in additional losses on these properties. We are actively managing and disposing of these foreclosed assets to minimize future losses.
Other repossessed assets decreased by
$42 million
, down
81%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The decrease was largely attributable to the sale of repossessed assets during the year.
The majority of our past due accruing loans are residential mortgages and student loans that are fully guaranteed by a federal agency. Accruing loans past due ninety days or more increased by
$463 million
, up
30%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, essentially all of which was attributable to guaranteed residential mortgages and student loans. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
$57 million
and
$84 million
, respectively, of past due accruing loans were not guaranteed.
At the end of 2010, we completed an internal review of STMs residential foreclosure processes. In 2011, we continued to improve upon our processes as a result of our review. In addition, following the Federal Reserve's horizontal review of the nations largest mortgage loan servicers, SunTrust and other servicers entered into Consent Orders with the FRB. We describe the Consent Order in Note
20
, Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and a copy of it is filed as Exhibit 10.25
22
to this Form 10-K. The Consent Order requires us to improve certain processes and to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010 to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and then make any appropriate remediation, reimbursement, or adjustment. Additionally, borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two-year review period have been solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. A direct mail solicitation was completed on November 28, 2011. The deadline for submitting requests for review is July 31, 2012. These requirements prescribed by the Consent Order may result in additional delays in the foreclosure process at a time when the time required for foreclosure upon residential real estate collateral in certain states, primarily Florida, continues to be elevated. These delays in the foreclosure process have adversely affected us by increasing our expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and by exposing us to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral. These delays have also resulted, in some cases, in an inability to meet certain investor foreclosure timelines for loans we service for others, which has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in the assessment of compensatory fees. Noninterest expense in our Mortgage line of business increased in
2011
as a result of the additional resources necessary to perform the foreclosure process assessment, revise affidavit filings and make any other operational changes. Additionally, continued and evolving changes in the regulatory environment and industry standards have increased our default servicing costs. Finally, the time to complete foreclosure sales has increased, and this has resulted in an increase in nonperforming assets and servicing advances, and has adversely impacted the collectability of such advances. Accordingly, additional delays in foreclosure sales, including any delays beyond those currently anticipated, our process enhancements, and any issues that may arise out of alleged irregularities in our foreclosure processes, could further increase the costs associated with our mortgage operations. See additional discussion in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K.
 
1
Does not include foreclosed real estate related to serviced loans insured by the FHA or the VA. Insurance proceeds due from the FHA and the VA are recorded as a receivable in other assets until the funds are received and the property is conveyed.
2
Includes $979 million, $494 million, and $236 million of consolidated loans eligible for repurchase from Ginnie Mae and classified as held for sale at December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
3
Nonaccruing restructured loans are included in total nonaccrual/NPLs.
Restructured Loans
To maximize the collection of loan balances, we evaluate troubled loans on a case-by-case basis to determine if a loan modification would be appropriate. We pursue loan modifications when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow our client to continue servicing the debt. For loans secured by residential real estate, if the client demonstrates a loss of income such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we may pursue short sales and/or deed-in-lieu
23
arrangements. For loans secured by income producing commercial properties, we perform a rigorous and ongoing programmatic review. We review a number of factors, including cash flows, loan structures, collateral values, and guarantees, to identify loans within our income producing commercial loan portfolio that are most likely to experience distress. Based on our review of these factors and our assessment of overall risk, we evaluate the benefits of proactively initiating discussions with our clients to improve a loans risk profile. In some cases, we may renegotiate terms of their loans so that they have a higher likelihood of continuing to perform. To date, we have restructured loans in a variety of ways to help our clients service their debt and to mitigate the potential for additional losses. The primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions of terms. For commercial loans, the primary restructuring method is the extensions of terms.
Accruing loans with modifications deemed to be economic concessions resulting from borrower difficulties are reported as accruing TDRs. Nonaccruing loans that are modified and demonstrate a history of repayment performance in accordance with their modified terms are reclassified to accruing restructured status, typically after six months of repayment performance. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, we expect that the loan will likely continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market. We note that some restructurings may not ultimately result in the complete collection of principal and interest (as modified by the terms of the restructuring), culminating in default, which could result in additional incremental losses. These potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall ALLL estimate through the use of loss forecasting methodologies. Roll rate models used to forecast losses on the residential mortgage and consumer TDRs are calculated and analyzed separately using their own portfolio attributes and history, thereby reflecting an increased PD compared to loans that have not been restructured. The level of re-defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, specific reserves included in the ALLL for residential TDRs were
$401 million
and
$422 million
, respectively. See Note
6
, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information.
The following tables display our residential real estate TDR portfolio by modification type and payment status at December 31. Loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae under an early buyout clause and subsequently modified have been excluded from the table. Such loans totaled
$65 million
and
$82 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
1
TDRs considered delinquent for purposes of this table were those at least thirty days past due.
2
Primarily consists of extensions and deficiency notes.
At
December 31, 2011
, our total TDR portfolio was
$3.6 billion
and was composed of
$3.1 billion
, or
87%
, of residential loans (predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit),
$442 million
, or
12%
, of commercial loans (predominantly income-producing properties), and
$39 million
, or
1%
, of direct consumer loans.
Accruing TDRs increased
$207 million
, up
8%
during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The increase in accruing TDRs was partly attributable to an increase in the number of loan modifications during the year and partly related to the adoption of new accounting guidance during 2011. Applying the new guidance, which required a review and evaluation of loan modifications completed since January 1, 2011, resulted in the identification of
$93 million
of additional TDRs as of July 1, 2011, which is the date the guidance became effective. Nonaccruing TDRs decreased by
$203 million
, down
20%
during the
year ended December
24
31, 2011
, primarily reflecting net charge-offs during the year, as well as returns of commercial TDRs to accrual status and repayments. See additional discussion in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 6, "Loans," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Interest income on restructured loans that have met sustained performance criteria and have been returned to accruing status is recognized according to the terms of the restructuring. Such interest income recorded was
$111 million
and
$92 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. If all such loans had been accruing interest according to their original contractual terms, estimated interest income of
$149 million
and
$125 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, would have been recognized.
SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The following is a discussion of the more significant financial assets and financial liabilities that are currently carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. For a complete discussion of our fair value elections and the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments, refer to Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
1
The current year amount is offset with cash collateral received from or deposited with derivative counterparties when the derivative contracts are subject to ISDA master netting arrangements. We made this change during 2011 due to resolution of certain operational limitations. This presentation is in accordance with applicable accounting standards and applied prospectively.
Trading Assets and Liabilities
Trading assets increased $
104 million
, or
2%
, since
December 31, 2010
. This increase was primarily driven by normal changes in trading portfolio product mix resulting in higher federal agency securities, agency MBS, CP and trading loans. The increase was predominantly offset by a decrease in corporate and other debt securities, a decrease in equity securities due primarily to issuer redemptions of ARS municipal fund preferred shares, and a decrease in derivative contracts due to offsetting cash collateral. Gross derivative assets increased $701 million primarily due to the increase in the fixed income portfolio driven by the declining interest rate environment. This increase was offset by $1.0 billion in cash collateral as a result of our ability to offset the derivatives
25
with the related collateral. In 2010 and 2009, the cash collateral was classified in other short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note
17
, "Derivative Financial Instruments," and Note
19

Certain illiquid securities were purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007 from affiliates, which included SIVs that are collateralized by various domestic and foreign assets, residential MBS, including Alt-A and subprime collateral, CDOs, and commercial loans, as well as senior interests retained from SunTrust-sponsored securitizations. During the first quarter of 2011, we recognized approximately $17 million in net market valuation gains related to these securities and received approximately $77 million in cash from sales and paydowns related to these securities, thereby eliminating our exposure to these distressed assets.
The Company also purchased ARS primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 as a result of FINRA actions and additional ARS in 2011 as a result of claims unrelated to the FINRA actions. See additional discussion related to ARS matters in Note
20
, Contingencies. The fair value of ARS recorded in trading assets and included in
Table 17
above declined to $48 million as of
December 31, 2011
, compared to
$147 million
as of December 31, 2010. The reduction was due predominantly to issuer redemptions of all of the remaining preferred equity ARS, offset by additional purchases and a gain in fair value of the CDO ARS. The remaining ARS includes trading securities purchased as a result of FINRA actions and are predominantly CDOs collateralized by trust preferred bank debt.
Trading liabilities decreased $
872 million
, or
33%
, since
December 31, 2010
, predominantly due to a decrease in corporate and other debt securities as a result of normal changes in trading portfolio product mix and a decrease in derivative contracts due to offsetting cash collateral. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in U.S. Treasury securities due to normal business activity. Gross derivative liabilities increased $452 million primarily due to the increase in the fixed income portfolio driven by the declining interest rate environment. This increase was offset by $1.2 billion in cash collateral as a result of our ability to offset the derivatives with the related collateral.
I
n 2010 and 2009, the cash collateral was classified in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note

Securities Available for Sale
The securities AFS portfolio is managed as part of our overall ALM process to optimize income and portfolio value over an entire interest rate cycle while mitigating the associated risks. The size of the securities portfolio, at fair value, was
$28.1 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
, an increase of $
1.2 billion
, or
5%
, compared with December 31, 2010. Changes in the size and composition of the portfolio during the year reflect our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage our interest rate risk profile. These changes included reducing the size of the U.S. Treasury securities portfolio by $
4.8 billion
, from which the proceeds were partly used to repurchase our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock that we issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. Over the course of the year, we also increased our agency MBS portfolio by
$6.9 billion
in an effort to capture better relative value. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, we recorded
$117 million
in net realized gains predominantly from the sale of securities AFS as a result of the aforementioned activities in our portfolio, compared with net realized gains of
$191 million
during the same period in 2010. For additional information on composition and valuation assumptions related to securities AFS, see Note 5, "Securities Available for Sale", and the Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale section of Note 19, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
At
December 31, 2011
, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $
2.9 billion
in net unrealized gains, comprised of a $
2.1 billion
gross unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $
848 million
net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of securities AFS reflected $2.4 billion in net unrealized gains, which were comprised of a $2.0 billion gross unrealized gain from our 30 million shares of Coke common stock and a $438 million net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio. The net unrealized gain, excluding Coke, increased due to the decline in interest rates experienced during 2011. The Coke common stock is subject to variable forward agreements, which is discussed in the Investment in Common shares of the Coca-Cola Company section below.
28
For the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the average yield on a FTE basis for the securities AFS portfolio increased to
3.26%
compared with
3.21%
for the year ended
December 31, 2010
. The yield increases were predominantly due to reduced holdings of lower yielding U.S. Treasury securities and increased holdings of higher yielding agency MBS securities during 2011.
The portfolios effective duration decreased to
2.3%
as of
December 31, 2011
from 3.3% as of December 31, 2010. Effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in market interest rates, taking into consideration embedded options. An effective duration of
2.3
% suggests an expected price change of
2.3
% for a one percent instantaneous change in market interest rates.
The credit quality of the securities portfolio remained strong at
December 31, 2011
and, consequently, we have the flexibility to respond to changes in the economic environment and take actions as opportunities arise to manage our interest rate risk profile and balance liquidity against investment returns.
Over the longer term, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. Accordingly, we may eventually decrease the size of our securities portfolio in response to loan growth and/or declining deposits.
INVESTMENT IN COMMON SHARES OF THE COCA-COLA COMPANY
Background
We have owned common shares of Coke since 1919, when one of our predecessor institutions participated in the underwriting of Cokes IPO and received common shares of Coke in lieu of underwriting fees. These shares have grown in value over the past 92 years and have been classified as securities AFS, with unrealized gains, net of tax, recorded as a component of shareholders equity. Because of the low accounting cost basis of these shares, we have accumulated significant unrealized gains in shareholders equity. As of
December 31, 2011
, we owned 30 million Coke shares with an accounting cost basis of $69,295 and a fair market value of
$2.1 billion
.
We commenced a comprehensive balance sheet review initiative in early 2007 in an effort to improve liquidity and capital efficiency. As part of this initiative, we began to formally evaluate the capital efficiency of our holdings of Coke common shares, as we were prohibited from including the market value of our investment in Coke common shares in Tier 1 capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy rules. As a result of this initiative, at various times during 2007 and 2008 we sold and made a charitable contribution of all but 30 million shares of our Coke stock. Additionally, during the second half of 2008, we executed The Agreements on the remaining 30 million shares that we owned. Our primary objective in executing these transactions was to optimize the benefits we obtained from our long-term holding of this asset, including the capital treatment by bank regulators.
We entered into The Agreements, which were comprised of two variable forward agreements and share forward agreements effective July 15, 2008 with a major, unaffiliated financial institution (the Counterparty) collectively covering our 30 million Coke shares. Under The Agreements, we must deliver to the Counterparty at settlement of the variable forward agreements either a variable number of Coke common shares or a cash payment in lieu of such shares. The Counterparty is obligated to settle The Agreements for no less than approximately $38.67 per share, or approximately $1.16 billion in the aggregate (the Minimum Proceeds). The share forward agreements give us the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the Counterparty, at prevailing market prices at the time of settlement, any of the 30 million Coke common shares that are not delivered to the Counterparty in settlement of the variable forward agreements. The Agreements effectively ensure that we will be able to sell our 30 million Coke common shares at a price no less than approximately $38.67 per share, while permitting us to participate in future appreciation in the value of the Coke common shares up to approximately $66.02 per share and approximately $65.72 per share, under each of the respective Agreements. The value of The Agreements represent a $189 million liability to us at December 31, 2011.
During the terms of The Agreements, and until we sell the 30 million Coke common shares, we generally will continue to receive dividends as declared and paid by Coke and will have the right to vote such shares. However, the amounts payable to us under The Agreements will be adjusted if actual dividends are not equal to amounts expected at the inception of the derivative.
Contemporaneously with entering into The Agreements, the Counterparty invested in senior unsecured promissory notes issued by the Bank and SunTrust (collectively, the Notes) in a private placement in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Minimum Proceeds. The Notes carry stated maturities of approximately ten years from the effective date and bear interest at one-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. The Counterparty pledged the Notes to us and we pledged the 30 million Coke common shares to the Counterparty, securing each entitys respective obligations under The Agreements. The pledged Coke common shares are held by an independent third party custodian and the Counterparty is prohibited under The Agreements from selling, pledging, assigning, or otherwise using the pledged Coke common shares in its business.
29
We generally may not prepay the Notes. The interest rate on the Notes will be reset upon or after the settlement of The Agreements, either through a remarketing process, or based upon dealer quotations. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of the Notes, we would be required to collateralize the Notes and the maturity of the Notes may accelerate to the first anniversary of the settlement of The Agreements. However, we presently believe that it is substantially certain that the Notes will be successfully remarketed.
The Agreements carry scheduled settlement terms of approximately seven years from the effective date. However, we have the option to terminate The Agreements earlier with the approval of the Federal Reserve. The Agreements may also terminate earlier upon certain events of default, extraordinary events regarding Coke, and other typical termination events. Upon such early termination, there could be exit costs or gains, such as certain breakage fees including an interest rate make-whole amount, associated with both The Agreements and the Notes. Such costs or gains may be material but cannot be determined at the present time due to the unlikely occurrence of such events and the number of variables that are unknown. However, the payment of such costs, if any, will not result in us receiving less than the Minimum Proceeds from The Agreements. We expect to sell all of the Coke common shares upon settlement of The Agreements, either under the terms of The Agreements or in another market transaction. See Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the transactions.
DEPOSITS
 
During 2011, we continued to experience deposit growth as well as improving deposit mix as the relative proportion of lower cost deposit accounts increased. These favorable trends were major drivers of the growth in net interest margin that we were able to achieve during the year. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased during 2011 by $5.5 billion, up 5%, compared with 2010. The growth was concentrated in noninterest bearing DDA, Money Market, and Savings accounts which increased $9.4 billion, up 14%. The increase was partially offset by declines in consumer time and other time deposit account balances which decreased by $4.0 billion, or 17%. These positive trends resulted from our continued marketing efforts, pricing discipline in the context of a low and declining rate environment, improving operational execution, as well as an industry-wide preference for greater liquidity.
Consumer and commercial deposit growth remains one of our key initiatives. During 2011, we continued focus on growing our client base, number of households, and deposit share while managing the rates we pay on our deposits. Overall growth was accomplished through a judicious use of competitive rates in select products and select geographies. We experienced mixed results across our 16 regions due to competitive forces and concentrations of time deposit clients; however, despite increased competition, we are up in eight of our ten largest MSAs. Other initiatives to attract deposits included enhanced product and features offerings, enhanced programs and initiatives, customer-targeted offers, and advanced analytics that leverage product offerings with customer segmentation. Through our Deposit Transformation initiative, we delivered client-focused banking solutions while responding to new regulations, such as the Dodd-Frank Act.  In addition, we provided client-facing teammates with new tools that enhance their focus on providing clients with personalized options and an exceptional client experience. We continued to leverage the Live Solid. Bank Solid. brand to improve our visibility in the marketplace. It is designed to speak to what is important to clients in the current environment and to inspire customer loyalty and capitalize on some of the opportunities presented by the new banking landscape. We continue to manage judiciously through the implications of impending or executed regulatory change and evaluate the impacts to our deposit products and clients. Average brokered time and foreign deposits decreased by $530 million, or 18%, during 2011 compared with 2010. This decrease was due to our ability to grow deposits and, in turn, reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources. As of December 31, 2011 securities pledged as collateral for deposits totaled $6.8 billion.

Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase mature overnight or at a fixed maturity generally not exceeding three months. Rates on overnight funds reflect current market rates. Rates on fixed maturity borrowings are set at the time of borrowings.

Other short-term borrowings includes master notes, dealer collateral, U.S. Treasury demand notes, CP, and other short-term borrowed funds.
Short-Term Borrowings
    
As of December 31, 2011, our period-end short-term borrowings increased by
$5.6 billion
, or
97%
, from
December 31, 2010
, due predominantly to a
$7.0 billion
increase in short-term FHLB advances, partially offset by a $740 million decrease in dealer collateral which was reclassified to offset derivatives, and a $536 million decrease in securities sold under agreement to repurchase.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, our daily average FHLB advances had a significant difference between the maximum monthly outstanding balance and the period-end outstanding balance resulting from our increase in borrowings during the fourth quarter of 2011, which is part of our ordinary balance sheet management practices. Our period-end outstanding balances for funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other short-term borrowings were not materially different from maximum monthly outstanding balances or from the daily averages for the year ended December 31, 2011.
31
Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following:
1
Debt recorded at fair value,
$448 million
and
$460 million
, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
2
Debt recorded at fair value,
$289 million
and
$290 million
, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
3
Debt recorded at fair value.
During the
year ended December 31, 2011
, our long-term debt decreased by $2.7 billion, or 20%. The change was predominantly due to the maturity of
$2.1 billion
, three-year, 3.00% senior notes;
$1.1 billion
, five-year, variable rate foreign denominated senior notes; and
$852 million
of our ten year 6.375% subordinated notes. During 2011, we also repurchased and retired
$395 million
and
$101 million
of junior subordinated notes that were due in 2036 and 2042, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by our issuance of
$1.0 billion
of 3.60% senior notes that mature in 2016, and
$750 million
of 3.50% senior notes that mature in 2017.
In November 2011, SunTrust Preferred Capital I successfully remarketed $102 million of our 5.588% junior subordinated notes due 2042. In connection with the remarketing, we repurchased and retired all of these notes held by the Trust. As part of the stock purchase contract between us and the Trust, we issued $103 million of preferred stock that the Trust purchased with the proceeds from the remarketing. See the "Capital Resources" section below for further discussion of the Series B Preferred Stock issued as part of this transaction.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve, measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies. The guidelines weight assets and off-balance sheet risk exposures (RWA) according to predefined classifications, creating a base from which to compare capital levels. Tier 1 capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments, less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt, ALLL up to a maximum of 1.25% of RWA, and 45% of the unrealized gain on equity securities. Additionally, for purposes of computing regulatory capital, mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt and index linked CDs accounted for at fair value are excluded from regulatory capital.
Both the Company and the Bank are subject to minimum Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of 4% and 8%, respectively, of RWA. To be considered well-capitalized, ratios of 6% and 10%, respectively, are required. Additionally, the Company and the Bank are subject to requirements for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital against average assets, as calculated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. The minimum and well-capitalized leverage ratios are 3% and 5%, respectively.
32
In March 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its CCAR to evaluate capital plans of the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies. Upon completion of their review, the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the CCAR in January 2011. As such, during March 2011, we initiated and completed certain elements of our capital plan, including issuing
$1.0 billion
of common stock and
$1.0 billion
of senior debt. We then used the proceeds from those offerings, as well as other available funds, to repurchase
$3.5 billion
of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, and
$1.4 billion
of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D, that we had issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. As a result of the repurchase of Series C and D Preferred Stock, we incurred a one-time, non-cash charge to net income available to common shareholders of
$74 million
related to accelerating the outstanding discount accretion on the Series C and D Preferred Stock.
On September 22, 2011, the U.S. Treasury sold, in a public auction, warrants to purchase
11.9 million
shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of
$44.15
per share (Series B warrants) and
6 million
shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of
$33.70
per share (Series A warrants). We had issued the warrants to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its investment under the CPP. The warrants have expiration dates of November 2018 (Series B) and December 2018 (Series A). In conjunction with the auction, we reacquired and retired
4 million
of the Series A warrants for
$11 million
.
We terminated certain RCCs in September 2011. We conducted a successful consent solicitation of the holders of our 6% subordinated notes due 2026 which allowed us to terminate all of the RCCs. Previously, the RCCs limited our ability to repurchase certain of our hybrid capital securities which generally do not qualify as Tier 1 common equity.
On December 15, 2011, we issued
1,025
shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, no par value and
$100,000
liquidation preference per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"). The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of SunTrust. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the greater of three-month LIBOR plus 0.65%, or 4.00%. Dividends on the shares are noncumulative. Shares of the Series B Preferred Stock have priority over our common stock with regard to the payment of dividends. As such, we may not pay dividends on or repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of our common stock unless dividends for the Series B Preferred Stock have been declared for that period, and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment. The Series B Preferred Stock was immediately redeemable upon issuance at our option at a redemption price equal to
$100,000
per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Except in certain limited circumstances, the Series B Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights.
During the
year ended
December 31, 2011
, our common equity increased by $1.6 billion, predominantly due to the common stock offering, net income, and an increase in AOCI driven by higher unrealized gains from securities. Conversely, total shareholders equity decreased by
$3.1 billion
from
December 31, 2010
, predominantly due to the repurchase of the Series C and D Preferred Stock.
Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital ratios were
9.22%
,
10.90%
, and
13.67%
, respectively, at
December 31, 2011
compared with
8.08%
,
13.67%
, and
16.54%
, respectively, at
December 31, 2010
. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 Capital ratio excluding preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was 10.08%. At December 31, 2011, our capital ratios remain strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements to be considered "well capitalized" according
33
to the current U.S. regulatory standards. Also, Tier 1 Common and Tier 1 Capital ratios continue to be well above both Basel I and Basel III regulatory requirements.
During the
year ended
December 31, 2011
, we declared and paid common dividends totaling
$64 million
, or $0.12 per common share, compared with
$20 million
, or $0.04 per common share during the same period in
2010
. Additionally, we declared and paid dividends payable of $
7 million
for both
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
on our Series A Preferred Stock. Further, during the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, we declared and paid dividends payable of $
60 million
and $
242 million
, respectively, to the U.S. Treasury on the Series C and D Preferred Stock.
Our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share, which was paid on September 15, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 1, 2011. However, we remain subject to certain restrictions on our ability to increase our dividend. If we increase our quarterly dividend above $0.54 per share prior to the tenth anniversary of our participation in the CPP, then the exercise price and the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our participation in the CPP will be proportionately adjusted. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10-K for additional considerations regarding the level of future dividends. Additionally, limits exist on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. Substantially all of our retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at
December 31, 2011
. However, at January 1, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately
$697 million
.
Basel III
In September 2010, the BCBS announced new regulatory capital requirements (commonly referred to as Basel III) aimed at substantially strengthening existing capital requirements, through a combination of higher minimum capital requirements, new capital conservation buffers, and more stringent definitions of capital and exposure. Basel III would impose a new "Tier 1 common" equity requirement of 7%, comprised of a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The BCBS has also stated that from time to time it may require an additional, counter-cyclical capital buffer on top of Basel III standards. As this would only be included in periods of above-average lending activity, it is not included in our calculations. It is anticipated that U.S. regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the BCBS. We monitor our capital structure as to compliance with current regulatory and prescribed operating levels and take into account these new regulations as they are published and become applicable to us in our capital planning.
The composition of our capital elements is likely to be impacted by the DoddFrank Act in at least two ways over the next several years. First, the DoddFrank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve to enact prudential capital requirements which may require greater capital levels than presently required and which may vary among financial institutions based on size, risk, complexity, and other factors. We expect the Federal Reserve to use this authority to implement the Basel III capital requirements, although this authority is not limited to the Basel III requirements. Second, a portion of the DoddFrank Act (sometimes referred to as the Collins Amendment) directs the Federal Reserve to adopt new capital requirements for certain bank holding companies, including us, which are at least as stringent as those applicable to insured depositary institutions, such as SunTrust Bank. We expect that the Federal Reserve will apply these to us over a 3year period beginning January 1, 2013 and that, as a result, as of December 31, 2015, approximately
$1.9 billion
in principal amount of Parent Company trust preferred and other hybrid capital securities currently outstanding, will no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment at that time. We will consider changes to our capital structure as these new regulations are published and become applicable to us.
The concept of Tier 1 common equity, the portion of Tier 1 capital that is common equity, was first introduced in the 2009 SCAP. Our regulator, rather than GAAP, defines Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio. As a result, our calculation of these measures may be different than those of other financial service companies who calculate them. However, Tier 1 common equity and the Tier 1 common equity ratio continue to be important factors which regulators examine in evaluating financial institutions; therefore, we present these measures to allow for evaluations of our capital.
The transition period for banks to meet the revised common equity requirement will begin in 2013, with full implementation in 2019. Details for estimation of the Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio are as follows:
34
These rules have not been finalized, so certain assumptions regarding their ultimate implementation have been made. Key assumptions are as follows:
Adjustments to RWA for Unrealized Gains/(Losses) on AFS Portfolio:
  Pursuant to its definition of Tier 1 common equity, the Basel III proposals no longer apply an adjustment to remove unrealized gains or losses recognized on the balance sheet, except those specifically mentioned relating to the cash flow hedge reserve. Under Basel I, consistent with the removal of these unrealized gains and losses from Tier 1 capital, the asset account reflecting these gains and losses (though they are reflected pre-tax) is not subject to risk weighting; only the book values of the assets are risk-weighted. The Basel III proposals do not state whether the asset account reflecting the gains should now be risk-weighted, and we make no assumptions or adjustments for this when estimating Basel III RWA.
Risk-weighting for MSR Assets:
  We anticipate that Basel III as applied to U.S. banks will use the current value of the MSR asset net of any associated DTL to calculate the threshold deduction in the estimation of both Basel III Tier 1 common and Basel III RWA. We believe this method of calculation is consistent with other large U.S. banks.
Cash Flow Hedge Reserve Adjustment:
  The Basel III proposals state that the amount of cash flow hedge reserve that relates to the hedging of items that are not fair valued on the balance sheet should not be considered in calculating Tier 1 common.  We hold a portfolio of receive fixed/pay variable swaps, which we use to hedge the cash-flow volatility on pools of floating-rate loans. The unrealized gains on these positions are reflected on the balance sheet within Shareholders' Equity in the AOCI account, and we remove them (as we do under Basel I) in the calculation of Tier 1 common (for Basel III purposes). It is unclear whether the unrealized gains on terminated positions, which are amortized through earnings based on the derivative's original maturity, could be included in Tier 1 common immediately. We exclude all of these unrealized gains when estimating Basel III capital levels.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Our significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K and are integral to understanding our financial performance. We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because (1) they require judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and (2) different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or reducing a liability. Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates are well controlled, applied consistently from period to period, and the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The following is a description of our current critical accounting policies.
Contingencies
We face uncertainty with respect to the ultimate outcomes of various contingencies including the Allowance for Credit Losses, mortgage repurchase reserves, and legal and regulatory matters.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Allowance for Credit Losses is composed of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments.
The ALLL represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The ALLL is increased by the provision for credit losses and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. The ALLL is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans (i.e., loans having similar characteristics) within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk-rating data.
Large commercial nonaccrual loans and certain commercial, consumer, and residential loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR, are individually evaluated to determine
the amount of specific allowance required using the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loan's expected future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition, or the loan's estimated market value. In these measurements, we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and unrealized losses in the portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific ALLL estimates. Key judgments used in determining the ALLL include internal risk ratings, market and collateral values, discount rates, loss rates, and our view of current economic conditions.
General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics, including smaller balance homogeneous loans. The ALLL Committee estimates probable losses by evaluating quantitative and qualitative factors for each loan portfolio segment, including net charge-off trends, internal risk ratings, changes in internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loans, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, industry conditions, and economic trends. In addition to these factors, the consumer and residential portfolio segments consider borrower FICO scores and the commercial portfolio segment considers single name borrower concentration.
Estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals, broker price opinions, recent sales of foreclosed properties, automated valuation models, other property-specific information, and relevant market information, supplemented by our internal property valuation professionals. The value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property. In limited instances, we adjust externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well supported reasons, such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property-specific factors or recent sales information. Appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property.
Our determination of the ALLL for commercial loans and leases is sensitive to the assigned internal risk ratings for PD and LGD. Assuming a downgrade of one level in the PD risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, the ALLL would have increased by approximately $520 million at December 31, 2011. In the event that estimated loss severity rates for the entire commercial loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the ALLL for the commercial portfolio would increase by approximately $90 million at December 31, 2011. Our determination of the allowance for residential and consumer loans is also sensitive to changes in estimated loss severity rates. In the event that estimated loss severity rates for the residential and consumer loan portfolio increased by 10 percent, the ALLL for the residential and consumer portfolios would increase, in total, by approximately $110 million at December 31, 2011. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do
36
not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and estimated loss severity rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed, management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be material to our financial statements.
In addition to the ALLL, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on our internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience, probability of commitment usage, and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.
Our financial results are affected by the changes in and the absolute level of the Allowance for Credit Losses. This process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables, and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity, we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved should we experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period. For example, changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, economic conditions, or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the Allowance for Credit Losses. Such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for credit losses. During the last three years, we have experienced elevated delinquencies and net charge-offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market. These market conditions were considered in deriving the estimated Allowance for Credit Losses; however, given the continued economic challenges and uncertainties, the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate. For additional discussion of the ALLL see the Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets sections in this MD&A as well as Note 6, Loans, and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Mortgage Repurchase Reserve
We sell residential mortgage loans to investors through whole loan sales in the normal course of our business. Prior to 2008 we also sold loans to investors through securitizations. In association with these transactions, we provide representations and warranties to the third party investors that these loans meet certain requirements as agreed to in investor guidelines. In the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in claims from investors regarding material breaches of these representations and warranties resulting in an elevated level in the repurchase liability. The majority of the losses incurred have related to loans sold to investors from 2005 to 2008. We have experienced significantly fewer repurchase claims and losses related to loans sold since 2009 as a result of stronger credit performance, more stringent credit guidelines, and underwriting process improvements.
Repurchase requests received since 2005 have totaled
$5.3 billion
which includes Ginnie Mae repurchase demands. The following table summarizes demand activity for the years ended December 31:
As presented in the table above, repurchase requests increased in 2011 with most of the increase occurring in the latter half of the year. This increase was related to loans sold to FNMA from 2006 to 2008; primarily those sold in 2007. The repurchase requests received continue to be concentrated in loans that are seriously delinquent or have already been through the foreclosure process.
37
The following table summarizes the original principal balance of loans sold from 2006 to 2008, excluding loans sold to Ginnie Mae, as well as the cumulative default rate and repurchase request rate.
As previously noted, repurchase requests received during 2011 primarily related to loans sold in 2007. The volume of repurchase requests from a particular sale vintage is driven by several factors. The primary factor is the volume of defaulted loans. As shown above, the largest volume of defaulted loans is from 2007 due to the volume of sales during that year, combined with the credit guidelines applicable to loans originated during that period. To date, repurchase request volumes were also driven by the inverse relationship between repurchase requests and the amount of time between origination and default. That is, the shorter the timeframe between origination and default, the greater the repurchase request volume; and the longer the timeframe, the lower the repurchase request volume. Because of this relationship, fewer repurchase requests received during 2011 were from loans sold prior to 2006 and, to a lesser extent, 2006 while requests from loans sold in 2007 and 2008 were higher.
Another factor is the investor selection and review process. We believe that the GSEs have primarily focused on defaulted loans that have been through the foreclosure process and have been less focused on outstanding loans that are seriously delinquent. We believe this is because the final resolution of an outstanding delinquent loan is not certain and also due to the backlog of foreclosed loans. However, we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests. The more recent selections, as evidenced by the GSEs' requests for full loan files, have shifted towards outstanding loans that are seriously delinquent. This could suggest that the GSEs are working through the backlog of defaulted loans from prior years and that the repurchase requests in the latter half of 2011 were due to an acceleration of timing of repurchase requests as opposed to an increase in the total population of requests.
Our liability for losses resulting from loan repurchases is initially based upon the fair value of these guarantees. Subsequently, the liability is reduced in proportion to the reduction in risk as actual losses are incurred, and additions to the liability are made for our estimate of incurred losses. The liability is calculated by sales vintage based on various factors including:
38
The previous table presented historical information regarding the population of defaulted loans and repurchase request rates. The following table presents historical information regarding the repurchase rates and loss severity for loans sold between 2006 to 2008.
Some of the assumptions used in the reserve process contain a level of uncertainty since they are largely derived from historical experience that has been limited and highly variable. As such, provision expense will vary as the estimates used to measure the liability continue to be updated based on the level of repurchase requests, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests, and other relevant facts and circumstances. One of the most critical and judgmental assumptions is the repurchase request rate because it requires us to make assessments regarding the actions that will be taken by third party investors in the context of the highly variable history we have experienced with their current volume and timing of requests.
Once we estimate the level of requests that we expect to receive by vintage, we apply factors for the probability that a loan will be repurchased as well as the loss severity expected. Our life-to-date repurchase rates are consistent with future expectations; however, given changes in housing prices over the past several years, we believe the loss severity over the past 12 months will be more indicative of our future loss severity rate.
Our current estimated liability for contingent losses related to loans sold was
$320 million
as of December 31, 2011. The liability is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related repurchase provision is recognized in mortgage production related (loss)/income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Various factors could potentially impact the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our mortgage repurchase reserve estimate. As previously discussed, the level of repurchase requests we receive is dependent upon the actions of third parties and could differ from the assumptions that we have made. Delinquency levels, delinquency roll rates, and our loss severity assumptions are all highly dependent upon economic factors including changes in real estate values and unemployment levels which are, by nature, difficult to predict. Loss severity assumptions could also be negatively impacted by delays in the foreclosure process which is a heightened risk in some of the states where our loans sold were originated. Approximately 16% of the population of total loans sold between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2008 were sold to non-agency investors, some in the form of securitizations. Due to the nature of these structures and the indirect ownership interests, the potential exists that investors, over time, will become more successful in forcing additional repurchase demands. While we have used the best information available in estimating the mortgage repurchase reserve liability, these and other factors, along with the discovery of additional information in the future could result in changes in our assumptions which could materially impact our results of operations.

Legal and Regulatory Matters
We are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits arising in the course of our normal business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts, and the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements.
 
39
We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. In many such proceedings, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates.
Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. However, it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from these claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, will not have a material adverse impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 20, Contingencies, and Note 25, Subsequent Event, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.
Estimates of Fair Value
Fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Certain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of recurring uses of fair value include derivative instruments, AFS and trading securities, certain LHFI and LHFS, certain issuances of long-term debt, and MSRs. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis either when such assets are carried at the LOCOM, to evaluate assets for impairment, or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non-recurring uses of fair value include certain LHFS, OREO, goodwill, intangible assets, nonmarketable equity securities, certain partnership investments, and long-lived assets. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value.
The objective of fair value is to use market-based inputs or assumptions, when available, to estimate the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available, we identify what we believe to be similar assets or liabilities. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities, we look to other techniques by obtaining third party quotes or using modeling techniques, such as discounted cash flows, while attempting to utilize market observable assumptions to the extent available. Absent current market activity in that specific instrument or a similar instrument, the resulting valuation approach may require making a number of significant judgments in the estimation of fair value. Market conditions during the credit crisis led to limited or nonexistent trading in certain of the financial asset classes that we have owned. The lack of liquidity and low level of activity in these markets creates additional challenges when estimating the fair value of related financial instruments.
Generally, the assets and liabilities most affected by the lack of liquidity are those required to be classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result, various processes and controls have been adopted to determine that appropriate methodologies, techniques and assumptions are used in the development of fair value estimates, particularly related to those instruments that require the use of significant, unobservable inputs. We continue to maintain a cross-functional approach when estimating the fair value of these difficult to value financial instruments. This includes input from not only the related line of business, but also from risk management and finance, to ultimately arrive at a consensus estimate of the instrument's fair value after evaluating all available information pertaining to fair value. This process has involved the gathering of multiple sources of information, including broker quotes, values provided by pricing services, trading activity in other similar instruments, market indices, and pricing matrices along with employing various modeling techniques, such as discounted cash flow analyses, in arriving at the best estimate of fair value. Modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including market-based assumptions, such as interest rates, as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset, market liquidity, and the risk of nonperformance. In certain cases, our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine, and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements. We used significant unobservable inputs to fair value, on a recurring basis, for certain trading assets, securities AFS, portfolio loans accounted for at fair value, IRLCs, LHFS, MSRs and certain derivatives. Overall, the financial impact of the level 3 financial instruments did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital. Our exposure to level 3 financial instruments continues to decline due to paydowns, sales and settlements of these instruments and minimal purchases. The following table discloses assets and liabilities that have been impacted by level 3 fair value determinations.
40
The following discussion provides further information on fair value accounting by balance sheet category including the difficult to value assets and liabilities displayed in the table above.
Trading Assets and Liabilities and Securities AFS
In estimating the fair values for the majority of securities AFS and trading instruments, including residual and certain other retained securitization interests, fair values are based on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments. Specifically, the majority of trading assets and liabilities are priced by the respective trading desk and the majority of securities AFS are priced by an independent third party pricing service. The Company has an internal, yet independent validation function in place to evaluate the appropriateness of the marks received from third party pricing services. For trading securities and securities AFS in active trading markets, this can be done by comparing the marks against two to three other widely used third party pricing services or sources. For less liquid instruments, we evaluate third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data such as any recent trades we executed, market information received from outside market participants and analysts, and/or changes in the underlying collateral performance.
We also gather third-party broker quotes or use industry-standard or proprietary models to estimate the fair value of these instruments particularly when pricing service information or observable market trades are not available. In most cases, the current market conditions caused the broker quotes to be indicative and the price indications and broker quotes to be supported by very limited to no recent market activity. In those instances, we weighted the third party information according to our judgment of it being a reasonable indication of the instrument's fair value.
When fair values are estimated based on models, we consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. As liquidity returns to certain markets, we have more pricing information from third parties and a reduction in the need to use internal pricing models to estimate fair value. Even though limited third party pricing has been available, we continued to classify certain assets as level 3 as we believe that this third party pricing relied on significant unobservable assumptions, as evidenced by a persistently wide bid-ask price range and variability in pricing from the pricing services, particularly for the vintages and exposures we hold.
41
As certain markets recover, we are able to reduce our exposure to many of our level 3 instruments through sales, maturities, or other distributions at prices approximating our previous estimates; thereby corroborating the valuation approaches used. Many of our remaining level 3 securities, however, will be held until final distribution or maturity. While it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cash value of these securities, we believe the amount that would be ultimately realized if the securities were held to settlement or maturity will generally be similar to or greater than the current fair value of the securities classified as level 3. This assessment is based on the current performance of the underlying collateral, which is experiencing elevated losses but generally not to the degree that correlates to current market values, which reflect downward pressure due to liquidity issues and other broader macro-economic conditions. It is reasonably likely that market volatility for certain instruments will continue as a result of a variety of external factors. This lack of liquidity has caused us to evaluate the performance of the underlying collateral and to use a discount rate commensurate with the rate a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction, but that also acknowledges illiquidity premiums and required investor rates of return that would be demanded under current market conditions. The discount rate considered the capital structure of the instrument, market indices, and the relative yields of instruments for which third party pricing information and/or market activity was available. In certain instances, the interest rate and credit risk components of the valuation indicated a full return of expected principal and interest; however, the lack of liquidity resulted in wide ranges of discounts in valuing certain level 3 instruments. The illiquidity that continues to persist in certain markets requires discounts of this degree to drive a market competitive yield, as well as to account for the anticipated extended tenor. The discount rates selected derived reasonable prices when compared to (i) observable transactions, when available, (ii) other securities on a relative basis, (iii) the bid/ask spread of non-binding broker indicative bids and/or (iv) our professional judgment.
All of the techniques used and information obtained in the valuation process provides a range of estimated values, which were evaluated and compared in order to establish an estimated value that, based on management's judgment, represented a reasonable estimate of the instrument's fair value. It was not uncommon for the range of value of these instruments to vary widely; in such cases, we selected an estimated value that we believed was the best indication of value based on the yield a market participant in this current environment would expect. Due to the continued illiquidity and credit risk of level 3 securities, these market values are highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility. Improvements may be made to our pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis as observable and relevant information becomes available to us. See Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a detailed discussion regarding level 2 and 3 securities and valuation methodologies for each class of securities.
Most derivative instruments are level 1 or level 2 instruments, except for the IRLCs, the Visa litigation related derivative, discussed below, and The Agreements we entered into related to our investment in Coke common stock, which are level 3 instruments. Because the value of The Agreements is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the Coke common shares, a Black-Scholes model is the appropriate valuation model. Most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market, such as the per share market price of Coke common stock, interest rates, and the dividend rate on Coke common stock. Volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement. The Agreements carry scheduled terms of approximately six and a half and seven years from the effective date, and as such, the observable and active options market on Coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments. As a result, we receive estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about Coke equity derivatives and is active in the market. Based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures as well as our own valuation assessment procedures, we have satisfied ourselves that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in arriving at the fair value of The Agreements. At
December 31, 2011
, the Coke derivative liability was valued at
$189 million
and was included within the level 3 trading liabilities portfolio.
 
At
December 31, 2011
, level 3 trading assets and level 3 securities AFS totaled
$49 million
and
$1.0 billion
, respectively. Our level 3 securities AFS portfolio included FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock, as well as certain municipal bond securities, some of which are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market; as such, no significant observable market data for these instruments is available. These nonmarketable securities AFS totaled approximately $770 million at
December 31, 2011
. The remaining level 3 securities, both trading assets and securities AFS, are predominantly private ABS and MBS and CDOs, including interests retained from Company-sponsored securitizations or purchased from third party securitizations. We also have exposure to bank trust preferred CDOs, student loan ABS, and municipal securities due to our purchase of certain ARS as a result of failed auctions. For all level 3 securities, little or no market activity exists for either the security or the underlying collateral and therefore the significant assumptions used to value the securities are not market observable.
Level 3 trading assets declined by
$160 million
, or
77%
, during the year ended
December 31, 2011
, primarily due to sales, paydowns, redemptions, and maturities of securities, partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of purchases. Level 3 securities AFS declined by
$95 million
, or
8%
, during the year ended
December 31, 2011
, due to continued paydowns and redemptions by issuers of securities, partially offset by net unrealized mark to market gains and a small amount of FHLB of Atlanta stock purchases. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, we recognized through earnings $44 million in net gains related to trading assets and liabilities and securities AFS classified as level 3.
42
Loans
The fair values of LHFI and LHFS are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade, as either whole loans or as ABS. When securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market, we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs, loan servicing fees, and various other transformation costs, when material. The fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity. Level 3 loans are predominantly mortgage loans that have been deemed not marketable, largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects. When estimating fair value for these loans, we use a discounted cash flow approach based on assumptions that are generally not observable in the current markets, such as prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and liquidity discounts. Absent comparable current market data, we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive upon sale of the loans.
Other Intangible Assets and Other Assets
Beginning January 1, 2010, we began recording all MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of MSRs is based on discounted cash flow analyses and can be highly variable quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. We provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure MSRs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. This sensitivity analysis does not take into account hedging activities discussed in the Other Market Risk section of this MD&A.
The fair values of OREO and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information. Our OREO properties are concentrated in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina. Further deterioration in property values in those states or changes to our disposition strategies could cause our estimates of OREO values to decline which would result in further write-downs. Estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. For long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. In determining the fair value, management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates, the life of the asset, and/or the market value of the assets. We test long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Other Liabilities
During the second quarter of 2009, in connection with our sale of Visa Class B shares, we entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid, if any, under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving Visa. The value of the derivative is estimated based on our expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation, which involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. As a result, the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level 3 instrument. At
December 31, 2011
, the Visa derivative liability was valued at $22 million and was included within other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note
18
, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion.
The fair value methodology and assumptions related to our IRLCs is described in Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Goodwill
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our reporting units with goodwill balances are Branch Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CIB, and W&IM. Branch Banking is a component of the Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reportable segment, Diversified Commercial Banking and CIB are components of the Wholesale Banking reportable segment, and W&IM has components in both the Wholesale Banking and Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reportable segments. See Note
21
, "Business Segment Reporting," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for a further discussion of our reportable segments.
We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of September 30
th
, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. The goodwill impairment analysis estimates the fair value of equity using discounted cash flow analyses which require assumptions, as well as guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available. The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities, and applicable valuation multiples based on the guideline
43
information. We assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by giving consideration to our market capitalization over a reasonable period of time; however, supplemental information is applied based on observable multiples from guideline transactions, adjusted to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of September 30, 2011, we determined there is no goodwill impairment as the fair value for all reporting units is in excess of the respective reporting unit's carrying value by the following percentages:
We monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2011 and performed an interim impairment test for Branch Banking. We found that its fair value had not changed since performing our annual test.
Valuation Techniques
In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which require assumptions about short and long-term net cash flow, growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. Additionally, we consider guideline company and guideline transaction information, where available, to aid in the valuation of certain reporting units.
Growth Assumptions
Multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, client service and retention standards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, forward interest rates, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was estimated at 4% as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product and inflation.
Discount Rate Assumptions
Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. In the annual analysis as of September 30, 2011, the discount rates ranged from 13% to 17%.
Estimated Fair Value and Sensitivities
The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is analyzed in relation to numerous market and historical factors, including current economic and market conditions, company-specific growth opportunities, and guideline company and guideline transaction information.
Economic and market conditions can vary significantly which may cause increased volatility in a company's stock price, resulting in a temporary decline in market capitalization. In those circumstances, current market capitalization may not be an accurate indication of a market participant's estimate of entity-specific value measured over a reasonable period of time. We believe that recent volatility may be tied to concerns related to a rating agency downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, market sentiment pertaining to the overall banking sector and concerns regarding the global economy, rather than the result of company-specific adjustments to cash flows, guideline multiples, or asset values which would have influenced the fair value of our reporting units. As a result, the use of market capitalization is a less relevant measure to assess the reasonableness of the aggregate value of the reporting units. Therefore, we supplement the market capitalization information with other observable market information that provided benchmark valuation multiples from transactions over a reasonable period.
The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions; therefore, in some instances, changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value of equity could change based on market conditions and the risk profile of those reporting units.
44
If there is a situation where the carrying value of equity exceeds the estimated fair value, an additional goodwill impairment evaluation is performed that involves calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, which is determined in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination.
The value of the implied goodwill is highly sensitive to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit's net assets. The fair value of the reporting unit's net assets is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques including the following:
Observable market information is utilized to the extent available and relevant. The estimated fair values reflect management's assumptions regarding how a market participant would value the net assets and includes appropriate credit, liquidity, and market risk premiums that are indicative of the current environment.
If the implied fair value of the goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill for the respective reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Changes in the estimated fair value of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the potential ranges of implied goodwill.
Income Taxes
We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities where we conduct business. We estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense or benefit is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future and are reported in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results. We review our tax positions quarterly and make adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. We regularly evaluate the realizability of DTAs. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, we consider the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. We currently maintain a valuation allowance associated with DTAs for certain state carryforwards. We expect to realize our remaining DTAs over the allowable carryback and/or carryforward periods. Therefore, no valuation allowance is deemed necessary against our federal or remaining state DTAs as of December 31, 2011. For additional information, refer to Note 15, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
Pension Accounting
Several variables affect the annual cost for our retirement programs. The main variables are: (1) size and characteristics of the employee population, (2) discount rate, (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, (4) recognition of actual asset returns, (5) other actuarial assumptions and (6) healthcare cost. Below is a brief description of each variable and the effect it has on our pension costs. See Note
16
, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.
45
Size and Characteristics of the Employee Population
Pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans, and other factors including salary, age, years of employment, and benefit terms. On November 14, 2011, we announced the curtailment of all pension benefit accruals as of December 31, 2011. The pension curtailment led to a remeasurement of pension obligations as of November 14, 2011 and adjustment of pension costs accrued after that date. Prior to the pension curtailment, most employees who had 20 or more years of service as of December 31, 2007 received benefits based on a traditional pension formula with benefits linked to employees' final average pays and years of service. Most other employees received a traditional pension for periods prior to 2008 plus a cash balance benefit based on annual compensation and interest credits earned after 2007.
Discount Rate
The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the date obligations are measured. The discount rate for each plan is reset annually or upon occurrence of a triggering event on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions. As mentioned above, the pension curtailment on November 14, 2011 caused a remeasurement and a reset of the discount rates. See Note
16
, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for discussion of the rate resets.
If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans, and keep all other assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/increase by less than $1 million.
Expected Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets
Expected returns on plan assets are computed using long-term rate of return assumptions which are selected after considering plan investments, historical returns, and potential future returns. Our 2011 pension costs reflect an assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% up to the November 14, 2011 remeasurement date, and 7.25% for the period November 14, 2011 to December 31, 2011, and 7.00% after December 31, 2011 for the impacted plans.
Any differences between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount. We amortize gains/losses in pension expense when the total unamortized amount exceeds 10% of plan assets or the projected benefit obligations, whichever is greater. Effective with the November 14, 2011 plan curtailment announcement, all pension gains or losses are being amortized over participants' average expected future lifetime, which is approximately 36 years. Prior to November 14, 2011, the amortization period for pension plan with ongoing benefit accruals was based on the average expected future service of active employees, which is approximately 8 years. See Note 16, Employee Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets.
If we were to assume a 0.25% increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans, holding all other actuarial assumptions constant, the benefit cost would decrease/increase by approximately $6 million.
Recognition of Actual Asset Returns
Accounting guidance allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years. However, we have elected to use a preferable method in determining pension cost. This method uses the actual market value of the plan assets. Therefore, we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost, as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience.
Other Actuarial Assumptions
To estimate the projected benefit obligation, actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate, and the rate of compensation increases. These factors do not tend to change significantly over time, so the range of assumptions, and their impact on pension cost, is generally limited. We annually review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience.
Healthcare Cost
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. Due to changing medical inflation, it is important to understand the effect of a one percent change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates. If we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be an $11 million and $1 million increase, respectively. If we were to assume
46
a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates, the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a $10 million and $1 million decrease, respectively.
To estimate the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011, we projected forward the benefit obligations from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, adjusting for benefit payments, expected growth in the benefit obligations, changes in key assumptions and plan provisions, and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year, including (where appropriate) subsidized early retirements, salary changes different from expectations, entrance of new participants, changes in per capita claims cost, Medicare Part D subsidy, and retiree contributions.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various risks. We have established an enterprise risk governance framework to manage these risks and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved. Underlying this framework are limits, policies, processes, and procedures designed to effectively identify, monitor, and manage risk.
The Board is wholly responsible for oversight of enterprise risk governance. The Risk Committee of the Board assists the Board in executing this responsibility. Administration of the framework and governance process is the responsibility of the CRO, who executes this responsibility through the CRM organization. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer, and provides overall vision, direction, and leadership regarding our enterprise risk management framework. In addition, the CRO provides regular risk assessments to Executive Management, the Risk Committee of the Board, Audit Committee of the Board, and the full Board, and provides other information to Executive Management and the Board, as requested.
Our risk governance structure and processes are founded upon three lines of defense, each of which is critical to ensuring that risk and reward in all activities are properly identified, assessed, and managed. The three lines of defense require effective teamwork combined with individual accountability within defined roles. The first line of defense is comprised of all teammates within our lines of business, geographies, and functional areas. The first line owns and is accountable for business strategy, performance, management, and controls within their business units and for the identification, management, and reporting of existing and emerging risks. The second line of defense is comprised of Corporate Functions, including CRM, with independent oversight responsibilities. Oversight includes governance, guidance, establishment of policy, and oversight of execution. The third line of defense is comprised of the Bank's assurance functions - Audit Services and Risk Review, which independently test, verify, and evaluate management controls and provide risk-based advice and counsel to management to help develop and maintain a risk management culture that supports business objectives.
Enterprise risk governance is supported by a number of senior management risk-related committees. These committees are responsible for ensuring effective risk measurement and management within their respective areas of authority. These committees include: CRC, ALCO, and the EAPMC. The CRC is chaired by the CRO and supports the CRO in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile. ALCO is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, and provides management and oversight of market-related risks, and has the responsibility to optimize those risks in relation to the profitability of the underlying businesses. EAPMC is chaired by the Wholesale Banking Executive and provides oversight of balance sheet allocations to ensure that new asset originations and assets available for purchase in the secondary market meet our risk and business objectives. It also oversees progress towards long-term balance sheet objectives. These management committees consist of key senior executives.The CRO is an active member of ALCO and EAPMC.
The CRO and, by extension CRM, establishes sound corporate risk processes that focus on identifying, measuring, analyzing, managing, and reporting the risks that we face. At its core, CRMs objective is to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities throughout SunTrust that:
To achieve this objective, we continually refine our risk governance and management limits, policies, processes, and procedures to reflect changes in external conditions and/or corporate goals and strategies. In terms of underwriting, we seek to mitigate risk through analysis of such things as a borrower's credit history, financial statements, tax returns, cash flow projections and liquidity, and collateral value. Additionally, our loan products and underwriting elements are continuously reviewed and refined. Examples include: client eligibility requirements, documentation requirements, loan types, collateral types, LTV ratios, and minimum credit scores. Prior reviews have resulted in more stringent documentation standards, lower maximum LTV ratios, and channel and
47
client type restrictions. These actions have contributed to material reductions in higher-risk exposures, such as higher-risk mortgage, home equity, and commercial construction loans since 2008. These higher-risk segments have produced the majority of our net charge-offs between 2009 and 2011. These actions have also contributed to a decline in early stage delinquencies and non-performing loans.
Organizationally, CRM measures and manages risk along four dimensions: credit risk, market risk (including liquidity risk), operational risk, and compliance/regulatory risk (including legal risk and reputational risk), which can be influenced by any of the other risk disciplines. Credit risk programs are overseen by the Chief Wholesale Credit Officer and the Chief Retail Credit Officer; market risk programs are overseen by the Chief Market Risk Officer; operational risk programs are overseen by the CORO; and compliance/regulatory risk programs are overseen by the Corporate Compliance and Regulatory Liaison Officer. Other activities overseen by CRM include risk information and reporting; risk analytics, including stress testing and the ALLL; Model Risk Management; asset quality/credit process assurance (Risk Review) and risk administration functions.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments, including on-balance sheet exposures from loans and leases, investment securities, contingent exposures from unfunded commitments, letters of credit, credit derivatives, and counterparty risk under derivative products. As credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients, the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long-run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy.
CRM establishes credit risk management governance frameworks and policies, and oversees adherence. It also independently measures, analyzes, and reports on portfolio and risk trends, and actively participates in the formulation of the Company's credit strategies. Credit risk officers and supporting teammates within our lines of business are direct participants in the origination, underwriting, and ongoing management of credit. They promote an appropriate balance between our risk management and business objectives through adherence to established policies, procedures, and standards. Risk Review, one of our independent assurance functions, regularly assesses and reports on business unit and enterprise asset quality, and the integrity of our credit processes.  In addition, total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored. Credit risk is partially mitigated through purchase of credit loss protection via third party insurance and use of credit derivatives such as CDS.
Borrower/counterparty (obligor) risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology, which has been implemented in all lines of business. We use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses. These models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience. To the extent possible, we collect internal data to ensure the validity, reliability, and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation.
We have made a commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to meet business requirements and comply with evolving regulatory standards. As part of a continuous improvement process, Credit Risk Management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools, implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures.
Operational Risk Management
We face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products. Coupled with external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, security risks, country risk, and legal risk, the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased.
We believe that effective management of operational risk  defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events  plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution. Our Operational Risk Management function oversees an enterprise-wide framework intended to identify, assess, control, monitor, and report on operational risks Company-wide. These processes support our goals in seeking to minimize future operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation.
Operational Risk Management is overseen by our CORO, who reports directly to the CRO. The operational risk governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function. These risk managers are responsible for execution of risk management within their areas in compliance with CRM's policies and procedures.
48
Market Risk Management
Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates or prices. Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and MVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is our primary market risk and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet, which includes all loans. Variable rate loans, prior to any hedging related actions, are approximately
55%
of total loans and after giving consideration to hedging related actions, are approximately
43%
of total loans.
We are also exposed to market risk in our trading instruments carried at fair value. ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. The policies established by ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board.
Market Risk from Non-Trading Activities
The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, both within policy limits approved by the Board and within narrower guidelines established by ALCO. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons.
The major sources of our non-trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, changes in the shape of the yield curve, and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models.
One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which is used to model net interest income from assets, liabilities, and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures. This analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis (and in the valuation analysis discussed below) relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities.
As the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance, we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve twists. Each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about client behavior in an interest rate scenario. Specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities.
The sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous
100
basis point move in benchmark interest rates. Estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed. The net interest income profile reflects a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position with respect to an instantaneous
100
basis point change in rates.
1
Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.
The recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective (above) is different from a financial reporting perspective (below) due to certain interest rate swaps that are used as economic hedges for fixed rate debt. The above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps, while the profile below does not include the net interest payments. The swaps are accounted for as trading assets and therefore, the benefit to income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading income(loss) from a financial reporting perspective.
1
Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.
The slight difference from
December 31, 2010
to
December 31, 2011
seen above in both the economic and financial reporting perspectives related to the
+100
basis point shock scenario is primarily due to a slight increase in asset sensitivity from projected balance sheet growth of floating rate assets funded with low cost deposits.
We also perform valuation analysis, which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis above. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as MVE. The sensitivity of MVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. Similar to the net interest income simulation, MVE uses instantaneous changes in rates. MVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the MVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the MVE profile indicates changes with respect to an instantaneous
100
basis point change in rates. MVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. However, results at
December 31, 2011
in the downward rate shock is significantly less meaningful than the upward rate shock. In a -100 shock scenario, current interest rate levels that are already at or near 0% are adversely impacting discounted cash flow analysis causing the short end of the discount curve to be zero bound and therefore, the shock behaves more like a curve flattener than a parallel shock.
1
Given the inherent limitations of certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.
While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario, we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since MVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in MVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current fiscal year). Further, MVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The net interest income simulation and valuation analyses do not include actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.
Market Risk from Trading Activities
Under established policies and procedures, we manage market risk associated with trading, capital markets, and foreign exchange activities using a VAR approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, spread risk, and volatility risk. For trading portfolios, VAR measures the estimated maximum loss from a trading position, given a specified confidence level and time horizon. VAR exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio.
49
Our VAR calculation measures the potential losses using a 99% confidence level with a one day holding period. This means that, on average, losses are expected to exceed VAR two or three times per year. We had no backtest exceptions to our overall VAR for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The following table presents high, low, and average VAR for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
.
Average VAR during the
year ended December 31, 2011
was lower compared to the
year ended December 31, 2010
primarily due to sales, paydowns, and maturities of illiquid trading assets. This is a result of continuing to manage down illiquid asset holdings where possible, as they are not part of our core business activities. While VAR can be a useful risk management tool, it does have inherent limitations including the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance. As such, VAR is only one of several tools used to manage trading risk. Specifically, scenario analysis, stress testing, profit and loss attribution, and stop loss limits are among other tools also used to actively manage trading risk.
Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, averaged
$3.9 billion
and
$3.5 billion
for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. Trading assets, net of trading liabilities, were
$4.5 billion
and
$3.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The increase in average and as of trading balances was primarily a result of an increase in the TRS portfolio and growth in fixed income trading, but partially offset by reductions in illiquid trading asset holdings.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost. We mitigate this risk by structuring our balance sheet prudently and by maintaining diverse borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs. For example, we structure our balance sheet so that we fund less liquid assets, such as loans, with stable funding sources, such as retail and wholesale deposits, long-term debt, and capital. We primarily monitor and manage liquidity risk at the Parent Company and Bank levels as the non-bank subsidiaries are relatively small and these subsidiaries ultimately rely upon the Parent Company as a source of liquidity in adverse environments.
The Banks primary liquid assets consist of excess reserves and free and liquid securities in its investment portfolio. The Bank manages its investment portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity, maintaining the strong majority of its securities in liquid and high-grade asset classes such as agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Banks AFS investment portfolio contained
$12.6 billion
of free and liquid securities at book value, of which approximately
94%
consisted of agency MBS, agency debt, and U.S. Treasury securities.
Some fair value assets are pledged for corporate borrowings or other liquidity purposes. Most of these arrangements provide for advances to be made based on the market value and not the principal balance of the assets, and therefore
,
whether or not we have elected fair value accounting treatment does not impact our liquidity. If the fair value of assets posted as collateral declines, we will be required to post more collateral under our borrowing arrangements which could negatively impact our liquidity position on an overall basis. For purposes of computing regulatory capital, mark to market adjustments related to our own creditworthiness for debt and index linked CDs
,
accounted for at fair value
,
are excluded from regulatory capital.
We manage the Parent Company to maintain most of its liquid assets in cash and securities that could be quickly converted to cash. Unlike the Bank, it is not typical for the Parent Company to maintain a portfolio of publicly traded securities. However, prior to retiring the preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in March 2011, the Parent Company invested approximately
$5 billion
of cash in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities. We manage the Parent Company cash balance to provide sufficient liquidity to fund all forecasted obligations (primarily debt and capital related) for an extended period of months in accordance with Company risk limits.
We assess liquidity needs that may occur in both the normal course of business and times of unusual events, considering both on and off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments that may impact liquidity in certain business environments. We have contingency funding plans that assess liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events such as credit rating downgrades,
50
severe economic recessions, and financial market disruptions. Our contingency plans also provide for continuous monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of contingent liquidity. These sources of contingent liquidity include available cash reserves; the ability to sell, pledge, or borrow against unencumbered securities in the Banks investment portfolio; capacity to borrow from the FHLB system; and the capacity to borrow at the Federal Reserve discount window. The table below presents period-end and average balances from these four sources as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2011
and
2010
. We believe these contingent liquidity sources exceed any contingent liquidity needs.
1
Average based upon month-end data, except excess reserves, which is based upon a daily average.
Uses of Funds.
Our primary uses of funds include the extension of loans and credit, the purchase of investment securities, working capital, and debt and capital service. The Bank and the Parent Company borrow in the money markets using instruments such as Fed funds, Eurodollars, and CP. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Parent Company had
no
CP outstanding and the Bank retained a material cash position in the form of excess reserves in its Federal Reserve account. In the absence of robust loan demand, we have chosen to deploy some of this excess liquidity to purchase and retire certain high-cost debt securities or other borrowings. During the
year ended December 31, 2011
, pursuant to a capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve, we repurchased high-cost Tier 1 capital securities, including certain Trust Preferred Securities and
$4.9 billion
of our Series C and Series D Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARPs CPP. Despite these transactions, the Parent Company retains a material cash position, in accordance with Company policies and risk limits discussed in greater detail below.
Additionally, contingent uses of funds may arise from events such as financial market disruptions or credit rating downgrades. Factors that affect our credit ratings include, but are not limited to, the credit risk profile of our assets, the adequacy of our ALLL, the level and stability of our earnings, the liquidity profile of both the Bank and the Parent Company, the economic environment, and the adequacy of our capital base. As of
December 31, 2011
, Moodys, S&P, and DBRS all maintained a Stable outlook on our credit ratings, while Fitch maintained a Positive outlook, citing improved credit and earnings trends. Future credit rating downgrades are possible, although not currently anticipated given the Stable and Positive credit rating outlooks.
Sources of Funds.
Our primary source of funds is a large, stable retail deposit base. Core deposits, predominantly made up of consumer and commercial deposits, are primarily gathered from our retail branch network and are our largest, most cost-effective source of funding. Core deposits increased to
$125.6 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
, from
$120.0 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
.
We also maintain access to a diversified collection of both secured and unsecured wholesale funding sources. These uncommitted sources include Fed funds purchased from other banks, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, negotiable CDs, offshore
51
deposits, FHLB advances, Global Bank Notes, and CP. Aggregate wholesale funding decreased to
$17.5 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
, from
$22.9 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
. Approximately
$4.1 billion
of wholesale debt matured during the
year ended December 31, 2011
and was redeemed at par. Net short-term unsecured borrowings, which includes wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and Fed funds purchased, decreased to
$5.1 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
, from
$7.1 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
.
As mentioned above, the Bank and Parent Company maintain programs to access the debt capital markets. The Parent Company maintains an SEC shelf registration statement from which it may issue senior or subordinated notes and various capital securities such as common or preferred stock. Our Board has authorized the issuance of up to
$5 billion
of such securities, of which approximately
$2.2 billion
of issuance capacity remains available. The most recent issuance from this shelf occurred on October 27, 2011, when we issued
$750 million
of
3.50%
senior Parent Company notes due January 20,
2017
. The Bank also maintains a Global Bank Note program under which it may issue senior or subordinated debt with various terms. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Bank had
$33.8 billion
of remaining board authority to issue notes under the program. Our issuance capacity under these programs refers to authorization granted by our Board and does not refer to a commitment to purchase by any investor. Debt and equity securities issued under these programs are designed to appeal primarily to domestic and international institutional investors. Institutional investor demand for these securities is dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to our credit ratings and investor perception of financial market conditions and the health of the banking sector.
Parent Company Liquidity.
Our primary measure of Parent Company liquidity is the length of time the Parent Company can meet its existing and certain forecasted obligations using its present balance of cash and liquid securities without the support of dividends from the Bank or new debt issuance. In accordance with risk limits established by ALCO and the Board, we manage the Parent Companys liquidity by structuring its maturity schedule to minimize the amount of debt maturing within a short period of time. During the
year ended December 31, 2011
, we had
no
Parent Company debt that matured, and approximately
$1 billion
of Parent Company debt is scheduled to mature in
2012
. Also during 2011, we repurchased
$395 million
of Parent Company junior subordinated notes that were due in 2036. A majority of the Parent Companys liabilities are long-term in nature, coming from the proceeds of our capital securities and long-term senior and subordinated notes.
The primary uses of Parent Company liquidity include debt service, dividends on capital instruments, the periodic purchase of investment securities, and loans to our subsidiaries. We fund corporate dividends primarily with dividends from our banking subsidiary. We are subject to both state and federal banking regulations that limit our ability to pay common stock dividends in certain circumstances.
Recent Developments.
Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals currently outstanding may have an effect on our liquidity if they become effective, the potential impact of which cannot be presently quantified. However, we believe that we will be well positioned to comply with new standards as they become effective as a result of our strong core banking franchise and liquidity management practices. See discussion of certain current legislative and regulatory proposals within the Executive Overview section of this MD&A.
On December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve published proposed measures to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, pursuant to sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act. These proposed regulations include a number of requirements related to liquidity that would be instituted in phases. The first phase encompasses largely qualitative liquidity risk management practices, including internal liquidity stress testing. The second phase would include certain quantitative liquidity requirements related to the proposed Basel III liquidity standards. We believe that the Company is well positioned to demonstrate compliance with these new requirements and standards if and when they are adopted.
Other Liquidity Considerations.
As presented in
Table 36
, we had an aggregate potential obligation of
$62.0 billion
to our clients in unused lines of credit at

. Commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to clients who have complied with predetermined contractual obligations. We also had
$5.2 billion
in letters of credit as of
December 31, 2011
, most of which are standby letters of credit, which require that we provide funding if certain future events occur. Approximately
$3.1 billion
of these letters as of
December 31, 2011
supported variable rate demand obligations.
As of
December 31, 2011
, our liability for UTBs was
$133 million
. The liability for interest related to these UTBs was
$21 million
as of
December 31, 2011
. The UTBs represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. The UTBs are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions, and if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid, the payments would be made from our normal operating cash flows, likely over multiple years.

Other Market Risk
Other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market, commitments to clients to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market, and our investment in MSRs. We manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale (i.e., the warehouse) and our IRLCs on residential loans intended for sale. The warehouses and IRLCs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate. The risk associated with the warehouses and IRLCs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market, which is typically 60-150 days.
We manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps, futures, and forward sale agreements, where the changes in value of the instruments substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the IRLCs. The IRLCs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedge accounting relationships.
MSRs are the present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio. The value of MSRs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio which is driven by the level of certain key interest rates, primarily the 30-year current coupon par mortgage rate. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. The average prepayment speed for 2011 remained relatively unchanged compared with 2010. There was a slight increase in prepayments toward the end of the year as mortgage interest rates declined.
MSRs, which are carried at fair value, totaled
$921 million
and
$1.4 billion
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, are managed within established risk limits and are monitored as part of various governance processes. We recorded decreases of
$733 million
and
$513 million
in the fair value of our MSRs for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. Increases or decreases in fair value include the decay resulting from the realization of expected monthly net servicing cash flows. For the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, we originated MSRs with fair values at the time of origination of
$224 million
and
$289 million
, respectively. New originations during 2011 more than offset the decrease in MSR value attributed to decay. An all-time low in mortgage rates accounted for the majority of the decline in fair value of our MSRs during 2011. Also contributing $38 million to the decline in the fair value of MSRs was an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to anticipated refinancing activity from the HARP 2.0 program.
For the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, we recorded losses related to MSRs of
$161 million
and
$69 million
(including decay of
$200 million
and
$240 million
), respectively, inclusive of the mark to market adjustments on the related hedges. We continue to evaluate the impact that the Consent Order may have, and we currently do not expect the impact to be material unless third party price indications reflect lower market valuations.
53
Recent changes to the U.S. Government's Making Homes Affordable Program will likely increase the number of borrowers that are eligible for mortgage refinance opportunities. We expect that prepayment rates for a portion of the loans in our servicing portfolio will increase and result in a decline in the value of our MSR asset in future quarters. Program terms, such as seller representations and warranties, will influence the impact on prepayment rates and those details have yet to be published.

We also have market risk from capital stock we hold in the FHLB of Atlanta and from capital stock we hold in the Federal Reserve Bank. In order to be an FHLB member, we are required to purchase capital stock in the FHLB. In exchange, members take advantage of competitively priced advances as a wholesale funding source and access grants and low-cost loans for affordable housing and community-development projects, amongst other benefits. As of
December 31, 2011
, we held a total of
$342 million
of capital stock in the FHLB. During 2011, we increased our capital stock holding in the FHLB by
$44 million
. In order to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, regulations require that we hold a certain amount of capital stock as either a percentage of the Banks capital or as a percentage of total deposit liabilities. As of
December 31, 2011
, we held
$398 million
of Federal Reserve Bank stock. During
2011
, we added
$7 million
to our position.
For a detailed overview regarding actions taken to address the risk from changes in equity prices associated with our investment in Coke common stock, see Investment in Common Shares of the Coca-Cola Company, in this MD&A. We also hold, as of
December 31, 2011
, a total net book value of approximately $192 million of private equity investments that predominantly include direct investments and limited partnerships. We hold these investments as long-term investments and make additional contributions based on our contractual commitments but have decided to limit investments into new private equity investments.
Impairment charges could occur if deteriorating conditions in the market persist, including, but not limited to, goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges and increased charges with respect to OREO.
We also have risk related to holdings of foreign debt, securities, and commitments to lend to foreign countries and corporations, both funded and unfunded. Specifically, the risk is higher for exposure to countries that are experiencing significant economic, fiscal, and/or political strains. At December 31, 2011, we identified five countries in Europe that we believe are experiencing strains such that the likelihood of default is higher than would be anticipated if current economic, fiscal, and political strains were not present. The countries we identified were Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and were chosen based on the economic situation experienced in these countries during 2011 and continuing to exist as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding exposure to sovereign debt of these countries. Although, at December 31, 2011, we had direct exposure to corporations and individuals in these countries of $10 million, that comprised securities held, unfunded commitments to lend, and a nominal amount of funded loans. Indirect exposure to these countries was $58 million at December 31, 2011 and consisted primarily of double default risk exposure. The majority of the exposure is the notional amount of letters of credit issued on behalf of our role as an agent bank under the terms of a syndicated corporate loan agreement, wherein other participant banks in the syndicate are located in the identified higher risk countries. Overall, gross exposure to these countries is less than 1% of our total assets as of December 31, 2011.

FOURTH QUARTER 2011 RESULTS
We reported net income available to common shareholders of
$71 million
for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of
$43 million
compared with the same period of the prior year. Earnings per average common diluted share were
$0.13
for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with
$0.23
for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter of 2011 results were adversely impacted by the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense of $81 million, after tax, and a decline in fee income related to mortgage and debit card fees, partially offset by higher net interest income, a lower provision for credit losses, and the reduction of preferred dividends as a result of repurchasing the Series C and D preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury on March 30, 2011.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, net interest income on a FTE basis was
$1.3 billion
, an increase of $30 million, or 2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. Net interest income growth was driven by increased earning assets, lower rates on deposits, and a continued shift in the deposit mix toward low-cost deposits, largely offset by lower earning asset yields. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 3.46% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with 3.44% for the same period of 2010, primarily driven by a 25 basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which more than offset a 20 basis point decline in earning asset yields.
For the fourth quarter of 2011, the provision for credit losses was
$327 million
compared with
$512 million
in the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline was due to lower net charge-offs and improved credit quality.
Total noninterest income was
$723 million
for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of
$309 million
, or
30%
, from the fourth quarter of 2010. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, the impact of HARP 2.0 on MSR valuations, and lower card fees with additional declines occurring across most other fee income categories. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, mortgage-production related (loss)/income decreased by
$103 million
, predominantly due to a $130 million increase in mortgage repurchase provision partially offset by higher income from loan production activities. Mortgage servicing income decreased by
$46 million
compared with the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to anticipated refinancing activity arising from the HARP 2.0 program. This resulted in a $38 million decline in the fair value of the MSRs. Card fee-based income decreased by
$37 million
during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010, as as a result of regulations on debit card interchange fee income that became effective at the beginning of this quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we also recorded $19 million of net gains from the sale of securities AFS compared to $64 million of net gains from the sale of securities AFS in the fourth quarter of 2010 that were realized in conjunction with the repositioning of our investment portfolio. Trading income/(loss) decreased by
$16 million
, compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The decline was largely driven by lower valuation gains on illiquid securities. Other noninterest income declined
$31 million
, which included a $13 million gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the sale of the MMMF business.
Total noninterest expense was
$1.7 billion
during the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of
$119 million
, or
8%
, from the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase was predominantly due to the
$120 million
potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense related to mortgage servicing claims. See Note 20, "Contingencies" and Note 25, "Subsequent Event," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional discussion. Additionally, operating losses increased by
$70 million
, which was predominantly due to specific legal accruals and operating losses associated with mortgage servicing. Partially offsetting these increases, was a decrease of
$114 million
in employee compensation and benefits compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline was largely driven by a
$88 million
gain recorded in connection with the decision to curtail our defined benefit pension plans, partially offset by a
$28 million
discretionary 401(k) contribution. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits
57
declined due to a fourth quarter 2011 reduction in incentive expense based upon our full year financial performance. Other noninterest expense increased by $53 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase included a $27 million accrual in other staff expense, which was related to severance expense associated with our PPG Expense Program, a $14 million increase in consulting fees associated with the Consent Order, and a $7 million increase in mortgage insurance expense.
The income tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2011 was
$57 million
, compared with the income tax provision of
$45 million
for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease in the income tax provision was primarily the result of a decline in pre-tax income adjusted for net favorable permanent tax items, such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and federal tax credits from community reinvestment activities in addition to favorable discrete items.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010
Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management
Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reported net income of $275 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $116 million, or 73%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in net income was attributable to a decline in provision for credit losses combined with higher net interest income, partially offset by a decline in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense.
Net interest income was $2.5 billion, an increase of $51 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by higher average loan and deposit balances and higher loan spreads, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Average loan balances increased $2.2 billion, or 6%, driven by higher indirect auto originations and the acquisition of student loan portfolios, partially offset by decreases in home equity lines, consumer direct installment loans, and consumer mortgage loans. Loan-related net interest income increased $68 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year driven by increased loan volume, while net interest income related to LHFS declined $5 million, or 100%, and funding costs related to non-earning assets decreased $20 million, or 11%.
58
Net interest income related to deposits was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $30 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2010. The decline was due to the lower value of deposits in the current rate environment. This was partially offset by higher balances, as average deposit balances increased $2.1 billion, or 3%. This increase was driven by an increase of $3.4 billion in money market accounts, $0.9 billion in demand deposits, $0.5 billion in interest bearing transaction accounts and $0.5 billion in savings accounts, largely offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in higher-cost time deposit balances.
Provision for credit losses was $722 million, a decrease of $173 million, or 19%, compared to the same period during 2010. The decrease was driven by declines in net charge-offs related to home equity lines, consumer mortgage loans and credit cards.
Total noninterest income was $1.4 billion, a decrease of $30 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2010. Service charges on deposits decreased $71 million, or 16%, driven by lower NSF/overdraft fees resulting from Regulation E changes that became effective in 2010
.
Other income decreased $19 million, or 24%, predominantly due to a gain from the sale of our Money Market Mutual Fund business in 2010.
These declines
were partially offset by increases in trust income of $35 million, due to higher market valuations on managed equity assets, and $27 million in retail investment income driven by increased recurring brokerage and annuity income.
Total noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increase of $8 million compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was predominantly driven by decreases in shared corporate expenses, partially offset by higher processing costs.
Wholesale Banking
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $361 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $120 million, or 50%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was driven by higher net interest income and a decline in provision for credit losses, which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and a decline in noninterest income.
Net interest income was $1.7 billion, a $169 million, or 11%, increase from the same period in 2010. Average loan balances increased $90 million, with increases in commercial domestic loans and tax exempt loans, offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans and nonaccrual loans. Loan-related net interest income increased $104 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased loan spreads.  Average customer deposit balances increased $3.4 billion, or 9%, compared to the same period in 2010. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as higher-cost time deposits declined $0.7 billion, or 22%, while lower cost commercial demand deposits increased $3.9 billion, or 24%, and money market account average balances increased $627 million, or 6%.
Provision for credit losses was $625 million, a decrease of $152 million, or 20%, from the prior year.   The decrease was driven by lower net charge-offs predominantly in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, leasing, and consumer mortgage loans.
Total noninterest income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $42 million, or 3%, from the prior year predominantly due to declines in performance in Three Pillars, equity and fixed income derivatives, and taxable fixed income sales and trading, partially offset by improved performance in loan syndications and structured lending, lower derivative counterparty reserves, and a decline in valuation-related losses associated with the deterioration of collateral on previously securitized loans. Decreases in letter of credit fees and trust and investment income were partly offset by higher gains on leased equipment sales.
Total noninterest expense was $2.2 billion, an increase of $91 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The increase was predominantly due to higher operating losses tied to increased legal-related expenses. Additionally, increases in staff expense and allocated corporate expenses were partially offset by decreases in collection services and other real estate expenses.
Mortgage Banking
Mortgage Banking reported a net loss of $727 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an improvement of $87 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2010. The improvement was driven by lower provision for credit losses that was partially offset by lower production income, lower MSR net hedge performance, and higher expenses.
Net interest income was $471 million, up $33 million, or 8%, over the prior year. The increase was predominantly due to higher net interest income on loans, which increased $55 million, due to improved spreads. Total average loans, primarily residential mortgages were relatively consistent with prior year, increasing $85 million. The improvement in net interest income on loans was partially offset by lower income on LHFS, which declined $31 million due to lower volumes and spreads.
Provision for credit losses was $693 million, a decrease of $490 million, or 41%, from the same period in 2010. The decline was driven by a $404 million decline in residential mortgage net charge-offs. Net charge-offs included $10 million and $51 million of
59
charge-offs related to NPL sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Noninterest income was $241 million in 2011, down $280 million, or 54%, from 2010. Total mortgage production income for the year was a loss of $19 million, down $133 million from the prior year as loan production volume of $23.1 billion was down $6.2 billion, or 21%, from the prior year resulting in lower gain on sale and fee income. Mortgage loan repurchase provision was up $46 million over the prior year due to higher agency-related repurchase requests.
Mortgage servicing income was down $134 million, or 37%, compared to 2010 due to less favorable net hedge performance, which was negatively impacted by $38 million due to an increase in prepayment assumptions attributable to anticipated refinancing activity arising from the HARP 2.0 program. Total loans serviced at December 31, 2011 were $157.8 billion compared with $167.2 billion the prior year, down 6%.
Total noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, an increase of $117 million, or 11%. The predominant drivers of the higher expense were regulatory compliance, operating losses related to mortgage servicing, and collection costs that were partially offset by certain lower volume-related expenses, and lower other real estate.
Corporate Other
Corporate Other's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was $443 million, a decrease of $19 million, or 4%, compared with the same period in 2010. The decrease was predominantly due to the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense and partially offset by increased net interest income and favorable mark-to-market valuations on our public debt and index-linked CDs carried at fair value.
Net interest income was $501 million, an increase of $35 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to an increase in income from hedges employed as part of our interest rate risk management strategies. Total average assets decreased $1.2 billion, or 4%, predominantly due to a reduction in investment securities in conjunction with the repurchase of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in the first quarter of 2011. Total average deposits remained consistent with the prior year at $1.5 billion. Average long-term debt decreased by $2.9 billion, or 19%, compared with 2010 as we repaid FHLB advances and senior and subordinated bank debt in conjunction with strong overall consumer and commercial deposit growth.
Total noninterest income was $297 million, an increase of $40 million, or 16%, compared with the same period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to favorable mark-to-market valuation on our public debt and index linked CDs carried at fair value and partially offset by a $74 million decrease in net gains on the sale of investment securities.
Total noninterest expenses increased $105 million compared with the same period in 2010. The increase is mainly due to the potential mortgage servicing settlement and claims expense, implementation expenses associated with our PPG expense initiative and lower net recovery of allocated corporate administrative expenses. Due to the uncertainty regarding the final terms of the potential mortgage servicing settlement, the entire expense accrual was recorded at the Parent Company within the Corporate Other segment.
Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 vs. 2009
Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management
Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management reported net income of $159 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $331 million, compared to a net loss of $172 million in the same period in 2009. The increase in net income was predominantly due to higher net interest income, lower provision for credit losses, and lower expenses due to the recognition of a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2009.
Net interest income was $2.5 billion, an increase of $273 million, or 13%, predominantly due to increased loan and deposit spreads, as well as higher deposit balances. Average loan balances increased $0.4 billion, or 1%, with increases in indirect auto loans partly due to the purchase of a $741 million high-quality consumer auto loan portfolio in the third quarter and $934 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and growth in guaranteed student loans. Partially offsetting those increases were decreases in home equity lines and consumer mortgages. Loan-related net interest income increased $94 million, or 11%, compared with the prior year driven by increased loan spreads. Average deposit balances increased $2.3 billion, or 3%, resulting in an increase in deposit-related net interest income of $114 million, or 7%, as a result of both the increase in overall average deposit balances and higher deposit spreads. Favorable mix trends continued as relatively low cost demand, money market and savings balances increased a combined $7.2 billion, or 23%. These increases were partially offset by a $4.9 billion, or 19%, decline in average time deposits.
60
Provision for credit losses was $895 million, a decrease of $237 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was predominantly driven by lower net charge-offs related to equity lines, indirect installment loans, and consumer loans.
Total noninterest income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $36 million, or 2%, predominantly due to a decrease in service charges on deposits of $78 million, or 15%, partially offset by an increase in interchange fees of $45 million, or 15%, resulting from increased transaction volume and the launch of a new check card option for clients. The decline in service charges on deposits was due to lower NSF/overdraft fees from Regulation E changes requiring clients to opt in to certain account transaction services that went into effect in August 2010 and the revised overdraft fee structure that went into effect in July 2010. Other income increased predominantly due to a gain from the company's Money Market Mutual Fund business in 2010.
Total noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, a decrease of $50 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was predominantly driven by a $173 million reduction in non-cash charges taken in the first quarter of 2009 related to the impairment of goodwill. Total expenses excluding the 2009 impairment of goodwill increased $124 million, or 4%, driven by increases in allocated corporate expenses, other expense related to the new check card offered to clients, and outside processing expense.
Wholesale Banking
Wholesale Banking reported net income of $241 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $433 million, compared to a net loss of $192 million for the same period in 2009. Net income increased due to lower provision for credit losses, higher net interest income and noninterest income, combined with lower noninterest expense.
Net interest income was $1.6 billion, a $33 million, or 2%, increase from the same period in 2009. Average loan balances decreased $6.9 billion or 13%, with decreases in commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and leases, partially offset by increases in tax-exempt loans.  Loan-related net interest income increased $60 million, or 7%, compared to the prior year as increased loan spreads more than offset decreased average loan balances. Average customer deposit balances increased $1.7 billion, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2009. Favorable trends in deposit mix continued as higher cost time deposits declined $1.4 billion, or 33%, while lower cost commercial demand deposits increased $1.4 billion, or 10%. Interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts combined average balances increased $1.7 billion, or 9%. Customer deposit-related net interest income decreased $6 million, or 1%, as the benefit from the improved deposit mix was offset by lower deposit spreads.
Provision for credit losses was $777 million, a decrease of $203 million, or 21%, from the prior year.   The decrease was predominantly driven by lower net charge-offs in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and leasing.
Total noninterest income was $1.5 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 8%, from the prior year predominantly driven by increases in trust and investment income, investment banking income, higher loan commitment fees earned on loan syndications/bond originations and trading account income. These increases were partially offset by decreases in operating lease revenue, letter of credit fees and deposit account service charges.
Total noninterest expense was $2.1 billion, a decrease of $147 million, or 7%, over the same period in 2009. The decline was predominantly driven by a $299 million reduction in non-cash charges taken in the first quarter of 2009 related to the impairment of goodwill. Total expenses excluding the 2009 impairment of goodwill increased $151 million, or 7%, driven by a $94 million increase in other real estate costs, a $20 million increase in indirect expense and a $39 million increase in staff expense.
Mortgage Banking
Mortgage Banking reported a net loss of $814 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an improvement of $175 million, or 18%, compared with the prior year. The improvement was predominantly due to a $279 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2009 and higher servicing income. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower mortgage production income, lower net interest income and higher provision for credit losses.
Net interest income was $438 million, down $62 million, or 12%. Net interest income on total average loans of $29.0 billion was up $54 million, or 25%, due to higher spreads. Offsetting this positive variance was a decline in income from LHFS of $93 million due to a decline in average LHFS of $2.1 billion, or 46%.
Provision for credit losses increased $58 million, or 5%. The increase was predominantly due to specific actions taken in the first quarter of 2010 which resulted in additional charge-offs recognized on severely delinquent residential mortgage NPLs, predominantly in Florida, as well as $51 million in additional charge-offs related to $211 million loans that were reclassified to LHFS and subsequently sold.
61
Total noninterest income was $521 million, down $166 million, or 24%. The decline was predominantly due to lower production income. Mortgage loan production income declined $251 million, or 69%, predominantly due to lower loan production. Loan originations were $29.3 billion in 2010, a 42% decrease from the prior year. Mortgage servicing income was up $66 million driven by lower decay due to slower prepayments on MSR values. Total loans serviced at December 31, 2010 were $167.2 billion compared with $178.9 billion at December 31, 2009, a 7% decline predominantly due to the sale of MSRs on residential loans with unpaid principal balances of $7.0 billion.
Total noninterest expense declined $323 million, or 23%, predominantly due to a $279 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in first quarter of 2009. Total staff expense declined $75 million, or 16%, due to lower commission expense resulting from lower loan production. Captive reinsurance reserve expense also decreased as a result of trust reserve limits being reached. These decreases were partially offset by higher allocated credit and technology costs.
Corporate Other
Corporate Other's net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 was $462 million, an increase of $123 million, or 36%, compared with the same period in 2009. The increase was predominantly due to increased net interest income, securities gains, and a decrease in noninterest expense due to a special FDIC insurance assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Net interest income was $466 million, an increase of $43 million, or 10%. An increase in income from hedges employed as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy was mostly offset by a decrease in net earnings on the investment portfolio and increase in funding cost related to the prepaid FDIC assessment. Total average assets increased $6.0 billion, or 23%, predominantly due to net purchases of investment securities and an increase in other assets due to the prepaid FDIC assessment. Total average deposits decreased $3.4 billion, or 67%, due to a decrease in brokered deposits, as we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources in conjunction with solid consumer and commercial deposit growth.
Total noninterest income was $257 million, an increase of $103 million, or 67%. Trading gains increased $156 million predominantly due to favorable mark-to-market valuation gains on our debt instruments carried at fair value compared to mark-to-market valuation losses in 2009. Net gains on the sale of securities increased $63 million compared with 2009. These increases were offset by a $112 million gain on Visa Class B shares recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Total noninterest expense decreased $132 million compared with the same period in 2009. The decrease in expense was predominantly due to the $78 million FDIC special assessment in 2009 and higher net recovery of allocated administrative expenses. This decrease was partially offset by a $31 million increase in debt extinguishment costs.

We present net income/(loss) available to common shareholders that excludes the portion of the impairment charges on goodwill and intangible assets other than MSRs allocated to the common shareholders and net income/(loss) to common shareholders that excludes the accelerated accretion associated with the repurchase of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. We believe these measures are useful to investors, because removing the non-cash impairment charge and non-cash accelerated accretion provides a more representative view of normalized operations and the measure also allows better comparability with peers in the industry who also provide a similar presentation when applicable. In addition, we use this measure internally to analyze performance.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

We present a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization/impairment of goodwill/intangible assets other than MSRs. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by us to assess our efficiency and that of our lines of business.

We present a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. We believe this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by us to analyze capital adequacy.

 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General
SunTrust, one of the nation's largest commercial banking organizations, is a financial services holding company with its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Through its principal subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, the Company offers a full line of financial services for consumers and businesses including deposit, credit, and trust and investment services. Additional subsidiaries provide mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, capital market services, and credit-related insurance. SunTrust operates primarily within Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. SunTrust provides clients with a selection of technology-based banking channels, including the internet, ATMs, and twenty-four hour telebanking. SunTrusts client base encompasses a broad range of individuals and families, businesses, institutions, and governmental agencies. Within its geographic footprint, SunTrust operated under the following business segments during 2011 and 2010: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CRE, CIB, Mortgage, and W&IM, with the remainder in Corporate Other and Treasury. During the first quarter of 2012, SunTrust revised its segment structure from six segments to three: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. See additional discussion of this change in Note 21, Business Segment Reporting.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The Company holds VIs, which are contractual ownership or other interests that change with changes in the fair value of a VIE's net assets. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary, which is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the financial performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive benefits through its VIs that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a VI held by the Company could potentially be significant to the VIE, both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size, and form of our involvement with the VIE are considered. The assessment of whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is performed on an on-going basis. The Company consolidates VOEs, which are entities that are not VIEs that are controlled through the Company's equity interests.
Investments in companies which are not VIEs, or where SunTrust is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets at cost, adjusted to reflect the Company's portion of income, loss or dividends of the investee. Unconsolidated equity investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method. Cost method investments are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and dividends received or receivable from these investments are included as a component of other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
Results of operations of companies purchased are included from the date of acquisition. Results of operations associated with companies or net assets sold are included through the date of disposition. The Company reports any noncontrolling interests in its subsidiaries in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and separately presents the income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of a consolidated subsidiary in its Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Assets and liabilities of purchased companies are initially recorded at estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date its financial statements were issued. For additional information on the Company's subsequent events, see Note
25
, "Subsequent Event."
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other banks, Fed funds sold, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Cash and cash equivalents have maturities of three months or less, and accordingly, the carrying amount of these instruments is deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
5
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Securities and Trading Activities
Securities are classified at trade date as trading or securities AFS. Trading account assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized within noninterest income. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Securities AFS are used as part of the overall asset and liability management process to optimize income and market performance over an entire interest rate cycle. Interest income and dividends on securities are recognized in interest income on an accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the security. Securities AFS are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of any tax effect, included in AOCI as a component of shareholders equity. Realized gains and losses, including OTTI, are determined using the specific identification method and are recognized as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
On a quarterly basis, securities AFS are reviewed for possible OTTI. In determining whether OTTI exists for securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether it has the intent to sell the security or, for debt securities, the Company assesses the likelihood of selling the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company intends to sell the debt security or it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to fair value, and the full amount of any impairment charge is recognized as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, only the credit component of any impairment of a debt security is recognized as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss), with the remaining impairment recorded in OCI.
The OTTI review for equity securities includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment and focuses on the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security's performance, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and management's intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value of an equity security that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recognized as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews nonmarketable equity securities, which include venture capital equity and certain mezzanine securities that are not publicly traded as well as equity investments acquired for various purposes. These securities are accounted for under the cost or equity method and are included in other assets. The Company reviews nonmarketable securities accounted for under the cost method on a quarterly basis and reduces the asset value when declines in value are considered to be other-than-temporary. Equity method investments are recorded at cost, adjusted to reflect the Companys portion of income, loss or dividends of the investee. Realized income, realized losses and estimated other-than-temporary unrealized losses on cost and equity method investments are recognized in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
For additional information on the Companys securities activities, see Note
5
, Securities Available for Sale.
Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold, plus accrued interest. The fair value of collateral pledged is continually monitored and additional collateral is pledged or requested to be returned to the Company as deemed appropriate. For additional information on the collateral pledged to secure repurchase agreements, see Note 4, "Trading Assets and Liabilities," and Note 5, "Securities Available for Sale."
Loans Held for Sale
The Companys LHFS generally includes certain residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, and student loans. Loans are initially classified as LHFS when they are identified as being available for immediate sale and a formal plan exists to sell them. LHFS are recorded at either fair value, if elected, or the lower of cost or fair value on an individual loan basis. Origination fees and costs for LHFS recorded at LOCOM are capitalized in the basis of the loan and are included in the calculation of realized gains and losses upon sale. Origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings at the time of origination for LHFS that are recorded at fair value. Fair value is derived from observable current market prices, when available, and includes loan servicing value. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models, in which the Company uses its best estimates of assumptions it believes would be used by market participants in estimating fair value. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are classified as noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
6
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The Company may transfer certain residential mortgage loans, commercial loans, and student loans to a held-for-sale classification at LOCOM. At the time of transfer, any credit losses are recorded as a reduction in the ALLL. Subsequent credit losses, as well as incremental interest rate or liquidity related valuation adjustments are recorded as a component of noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). The Company may also transfer loans from held for sale to held for investment. At the time of transfer, any difference between the carrying amount of the loan and its outstanding principal balance is recognized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method, unless the loan was elected upon origination to be accounted for at fair value. If a held for sale loan is transferred to held for investment for which fair value accounting was elected, it will continue to be accounted for at fair value in the held for investment portfolio. For additional information on the Companys LHFS activities, see Note
6
, Loans.
Loans
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are considered LHFI. The Companys loan balance is comprised of loans held in portfolio, including commercial loans, consumer loans, and residential loans. Interest income on all types of loans, except those classified as nonaccrual, is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amounts using the effective yield method.
Commercial loans (commercial & industrial, commercial real estate, and commercial construction) are considered to be past due when payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date. The Company typically classifies commercial loans as nonaccrual when one of the following events occurs: (i) interest or principal has been past due 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection; (ii) collection of recorded interest or principal is not anticipated; or (iii) income for the loan is recognized on a cash basis due to the deterioration in the financial condition of the debtor. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized after the principal has been reduced to zero. If and when commercial borrowers demonstrate the ability to repay a loan in accordance with the contractual terms of a loan classified as nonaccrual, the loan may be returned to accrual status upon meeting all regulatory, accounting, and internal policy requirements.
Consumer loans (guaranteed and private student loans, other direct, indirect, and credit card) are considered to be past due when payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date. Guaranteed student loans continue to accrue interest regardless of delinquency status because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. Other direct and indirect loans are typically placed on nonaccrual when payments have been past due for 90 days or more except when the borrower has declared bankruptcy, in which case, they are moved to nonaccrual status once they become 60 days past due. Credit card loans are never placed on nonaccrual status but rather are charged off once they are 180 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Nonaccrual consumer loans are typically returned to accrual status once they are no longer past due.
Residential loans (guaranteed and nonguaranteed residential mortgages, home equity products, and residential construction) are considered to be past due when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for one month. Guaranteed residential mortgages continue to accrue interest regardless of delinquency status because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured. Nonguaranteed residential mortgages and residential construction loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when three payments are past due. Home equity products are generally placed on nonaccrual when payments are 90 days past due. The exception for nonguaranteed residential mortgages, residential construction loans, and home equity products is when the borrower has declared bankruptcy, in which case, they are moved to nonaccrual status once they become 60 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual, unpaid interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans, if recognized, is recognized on a cash basis. Nonaccrual residential loans are typically returned to accrual status once they no longer meet the delinquency threshold that resulted in them initially being moved to nonaccrual status.
TDRs are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time of restructure, and the Company has granted an economic concession to the borrower. To date, the Companys TDRs have been predominantly first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Prior to modifying a borrowers loan terms, the Company performs an evaluation of the borrowers financial condition and ability to service under the potential modified loan terms. The types of concessions generally granted are extensions of the loan maturity date and/or reductions in the original contractual interest rate. If a loan is accruing at the time of modification, the loan remains on accrual status and is subject to the Companys charge-off and nonaccrual policies. See the Allowance for Credit Losses section within this Note for further information regarding these policies. If a loan is on nonaccrual before it is determined to be a TDR then the loan remains on nonaccrual. TDRs may be returned to accrual status if there has been at least a six month sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower. Generally, once a residential loan becomes a TDR, the Company expects that the loan will likely continue to be reported as a TDR for its remaining life even after returning to accruing status as the modified rates and terms at the time of modification were typically more favorable than those generally available in the market. Interest income recognition on impaired loans is dependent upon nonaccrual status, TDR designation, and loan type as discussed above.
7
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
For loans accounted for at amortized cost, fees and incremental direct costs associated with the loan origination and pricing process, as well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms. Premiums for purchased credit cards are amortized on a straight-line basis over one year. Fees received for providing loan commitments that result in funded loans are recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment of the yield. If a loan is never funded, the commitment fee is recognized into noninterest income at the expiration of the commitment period. Origination fees and costs are recognized in noninterest income and expense at the time of origination for newly-originated loans that are accounted for at fair value. For additional information on the Company's loans activities, see Note
6
, Loans.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Allowance for Credit Losses is composed of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The Companys ALLL is the amount considered adequate to absorb probable losses within the portfolio based on managements evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. In addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes, the Company employs a variety of modeling and estimation techniques to measure credit risk and construct an appropriate and adequate ALLL. Numerous asset quality measures, both quantitative and qualitative, are considered in estimating the ALLL. Such evaluation considers numerous factors for each of the loan portfolio segments, including, but not limited to net charge-off trends, internal risk ratings, changes in internal risk ratings, loss forecasts, collateral values, geographic location, delinquency rates, nonperforming and restructured loan status, origination channel, product mix, underwriting practices, industry conditions, and economic trends. Additionally, refreshed FICO scores are considered for consumer and residential loans and single name borrower concentration is considered for commercial loans. These credit quality factors are incorporated into various loss estimation models and analytical tools utilized in the ALLL process and/or are qualitatively considered in evaluating the overall reasonableness of the ALLL.
Large commercial (all loan classes) nonaccrual loans and certain consumer (other direct and credit card), residential (nonguaranteed residential mortgages, home equity products, and residential construction), and commercial (all classes) loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually identified for evaluation of impairment. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement. If necessary, a specific allowance is established for individually evaluated impaired loans. The specific allowance established for these loans is based on a thorough analysis of the most probable source of repayment, including the present value of the loans expected future cash flows, the loans estimated market value, or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral depending on the most likely source of repayment. Any change in the present value attributable to the passage of time is recognized through the provision for credit losses.
General allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools based on similar characteristics. In this process, general allowance factors are based on an analysis of historical charge-off experience, portfolio trends, regional and national economic conditions, and expected LGD derived from the Companys internal risk rating process. Other adjustments may be made to the ALLL after an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or other risk rating data. These influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting, concentration risk, macroeconomic conditions, and/or recent observable asset quality trends.
The Companys charge-off policy meets regulatory minimums. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of 120 days past due. Losses, as appropriate, on secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically recognized between 120 and 180 days past due, depending on the collateral type, in compliance with the FFIEC guidelines. Loans that have been partially charged-off remain on nonperforming status, regardless of collateral value, until specific borrower performance criteria are met.
The Company uses numerous sources of information in order to make an appropriate evaluation of a propertys value. Estimated collateral valuations are based on appraisals, broker price opinions, recent sales of foreclosed properties, automated valuation models, other property-specific information, and relevant market information, supplemented by the Companys internal property valuation professionals. The value estimate is based on an orderly disposition and marketing period of the property. In limited instances, the Company adjusts externally provided appraisals for justifiable and well-supported reasons, such as an appraiser not being aware of certain property-specific factors or recent sales information. Appraisals generally represent the as is value of the property but may be adjusted based on the intended disposition strategy of the property.
For commercial real estate loans secured by property, an acceptable third-party appraisal or other form of evaluation, as permitted by regulation, is obtained prior to the origination of the loan and upon a subsequent transaction involving a material change in terms. In addition, updated valuations may be obtained during the life of a transaction, as appropriate, such as when a loan's performance materially deteriorates. In situations where an updated appraisal has not been received or a formal evaluation performed, the Company monitors factors that can positively or negatively impact property value, such as the date of the last valuation, the volatility of property values in specific markets, changes in the value of similar properties, and changes in the
8
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
characteristics of individual properties. Changes in collateral value affect the ALLL through the risk rating or impaired loan evaluation process. Charge-offs are recognized when the amount of the loss is quantifiable and timing is known. The charge-off is measured based on the difference between the loans carrying value, including deferred fees, and the estimated net realizable value of the loan, net of estimated selling costs. When assessing property value for the purpose of determining a charge-off, a third-party appraisal or an independently derived internal evaluation is generally employed.
For mortgage loans secured by residential property where the Company is proceeding with a foreclosure action, a new valuation is obtained prior to the loan becoming 180 days past due and, if required, the loan is written down to net realizable value, net of estimated selling costs. In the event the Company decides not to proceed with a foreclosure action, the full balance of the loan is charged-off. If a loan remains in the foreclosure process for 12 months past the original charge-off, typically at 180 days past due, the Company obtains a new valuation annually. Any additional loss based on the new valuation is either charged-off or provided for through the ALLL. At foreclosure, a new valuation is obtained and the loan is transferred to OREO at the new valuation less estimated selling costs; any loan balance in excess of the transfer value is charged-off. Estimated declines in value of the residential collateral between these formal evaluation events are captured in the ALLL based on changes in the house price index in the applicable MSA or other market information.
In addition to the ALLL, the Company also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are analyzed and segregated by risk similar to funded loans based on the Companys internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in combination with an analysis of historical loss experience, probability of commitment usage, existing economic conditions, and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other liabilities and through the third quarter of 2009, the provision associated with changes in the unfunded lending commitment reserve was reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) in noninterest expense. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company began recording changes in the unfunded lending commitment reserve in the provision for credit losses. For additional information on the Company's Allowance for Credit Loss activities, see Note

, Allowance for Credit Losses.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated predominantly using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or the lease term, depending on whether the lease meets the transfer of ownership or bargain-purchase option criterion. Certain leases are capitalized as assets for financial reporting purposes and are amortized using the straight-line method of amortization over the assets estimated useful lives or the lease terms, depending on the criteria that gave rise to the capitalization of the assets. Construction and software in process includes in process branch expansion, branch renovation, and software development projects. Upon completion, branch related projects are maintained in premises and equipment while completed software projects are reclassified to other assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life. Premises and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. For additional information on the Companys premises and equipment activities, see Note 8, Premises and Equipment.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which are operating segments or one level below an operating segment, as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assigned to the Companys reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment, at least annually, at the reporting unit level. The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. The first step is used to identify potential impairment and the second step, if required, measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value. If the implied fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.
Identified intangible assets that have a designated finite life are amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. For additional information on the Companys activities related to goodwill and other intangibles, see Note 9, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
MSRs
The Company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSRs when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained. Effective January 1, 2009, MSRs related to loans originated and sold after January 1, 2008 were accounted for at fair value. Effective January 1, 2010, the Company elected to record MSRs related to loans originated and sold before January 1, 2008, at fair value. These MSRs were previously carried at LOCOM. The Company now records all MSRs at fair value. Fair value is determined by projecting net servicing cash flows, which are then discounted to estimate the fair value. The Company actively hedges its MSRs.The fair values of MSRs are impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, servicing costs and underlying portfolio characteristics. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties. The carrying value of MSRs is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other intangible assets. Servicing fees are recognized as they are received and changes in fair value are also reported in mortgage servicing related income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). For additional information on the Companys servicing fees, see Note
9
, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Other Real Estate Owned
Assets acquired through, or in lieu of loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the lower of the loans cost basis or the assets fair value at the date of foreclosure, less estimated selling costs. To the extent fair value, less cost to sell, is less than the loans cost basis, the difference is charged to the ALLL at the date of transfer into OREO. The Company estimates market values primarily based on appraisals and other market information. Subsequent changes in value of the assets are reported as adjustments to the assets carrying amount. Subsequent to foreclosure, changes in value along with gains or losses from the disposition on these assets are reported in noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). For additional information on the Company's activities related to OREO, see Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement.
Loan Sales and Securitizations
The Company sells and at times may securitize loans and other financial assets. When the Company securitizes assets, it may hold a portion of the securities issued, including senior interests, subordinated and other residual interests, interest-only strips, and principal-only strips, all of which are considered retained interests in the transferred assets. Previously when the Company retained securitized interests, the cost basis of the securitized financial assets were allocated between the sold and retained portions based on their relative fair values. The gain or loss on sale was then calculated based on the difference between proceeds received, which includes cash proceeds and the fair value of MSRs, if any, and the cost basis allocated to the sold interests. The retained interests were subsequently carried at fair value. Since January 1, 2010, retained securitized interests are recognized and initially measured at fair value. The interests in securitized assets held by the Company are typically classified as either securities AFS or trading assets and carried at fair value, which is based on independent, third-party market prices, market prices for similar assets, or discounted cash flow analyses. If market prices are not available, fair value is calculated using managements best estimates of key assumptions, including credit losses, loan repayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For additional information on the Companys securitization activities, see Note
11
, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities.
Income Taxes
The provision/(benefit) for income taxes is based on income and expense reported for financial statement purposes after adjustment for permanent differences such as interest income from lending to tax-exempt entities and tax credits from community reinvestment activities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax return purposes. These assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. Subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the provision/(benefit) for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is recognized for a DTA if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In computing the income tax provision/(benefit), the Company evaluates the technical merits of its income tax positions based on current legislative, judicial and regulatory guidance. Interest and penalties related to the Companys tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax provision/(benefit). For additional information on the Companys activities related to income taxes, see Note 15, Income Taxes.
Earnings Per Share
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income/(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders
10
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus common share equivalents calculated for stock options and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method. In periods of a net loss, diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner as basic EPS.
The Company has issued certain restricted stock awards, which are unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. These restricted shares are considered participating securities. Accordingly, the Company calculated net income available to common shareholders pursuant to the two-class method, whereby net income is allocated between common shareholders and participating securities. In periods of a net loss, no allocation is made to participating securities as they are not contractually required to fund net losses.
Net income available to common shareholders represents net income/(loss) after preferred stock dividends, accretion of the discount on preferred stock issuances, gains or losses from any repurchases of preferred stock, and dividends and allocation of undistributed earnings to the participating securities. For additional information on the Companys EPS, see Note
13
, Net Income/(Loss) Per Share.
Guarantees
The Company recognizes a liability at the inception of a guarantee, at an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. A guarantee is defined as a contract that contingently requires a company to make payment to a guaranteed party based upon changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party, or upon failure of a third-party to perform under a specified agreement. The Company considers the following arrangements to be guarantees: certain asset purchase/sale agreements, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements and certain derivative contracts. For additional information on the Companys guarantor obligations, see Note
18
, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company records all contracts that satisfy the definition of a derivative at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative is dependent upon its classification as either a freestanding derivative or a derivative that has been designated as a hedging instrument. The Company offsets cash collateral paid to and received from derivatives counterparties when the derivative contracts are subject to ISDA master netting arrangements and meet derivatives accounting guidance.
Changes in the fair value of freestanding derivatives are recorded in noninterest income. Freestanding derivatives include derivatives that the Company enters into in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions and as a risk management tool to economically hedge certain identified market risks, along with certain IRLCs on residential mortgage loans that are a normal part of the Companys operations. The Company also evaluates contracts, such as brokered deposits and short-term debt, to determine whether any embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated and separately accounted for as freestanding derivatives. For certain contracts containing embedded derivatives, the Company has elected not to bifurcate the embedded derivative and instead carry the entire contract at fair value.
Certain derivatives are also used as risk management tools and designated as accounting hedges of the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates or other identified market risks. The Company prepares written hedge documentation for all derivatives which are designated as hedges of (1) changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge) attributable to a specified risk or (2) a forecasted transaction, such as the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). The written hedge documentation includes identification of, among other items, the risk management objective, hedging instrument, hedged item and methodologies for assessing and measuring hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness, along with support for managements assertion that the hedge will be highly effective. Methodologies related to hedge effectiveness and ineffectiveness are consistent between similar types of hedge transactions and have included (i) statistical regression analysis of changes in the cash flows of the actual derivative and a perfectly effective hypothetical derivative, and (ii) statistical regression analysis of changes in the fair values of the actual derivative and the hedged item.
For designated hedging relationships, the Company performs retrospective and prospective effectiveness testing using quantitative methods and does not assume perfect effectiveness through the matching of critical terms. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of hedge ineffectiveness are performed at least quarterly for ongoing effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge are recorded in current period earnings, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk. The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that has been designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are initially recorded in AOCI and reclassified to earnings in the same period that the hedged item impacts earnings; any ineffective portion is recorded in current period earnings.
11
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Hedge accounting ceases on transactions that are no longer deemed effective, or for which the derivative has been terminated or de-designated. For discontinued fair value hedges where the hedged item remains outstanding, the hedged item would cease to be remeasured at fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk and any existing basis adjustment would be recognized as an adjustment to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item. For discontinued cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI would be reclassified to earnings in the period when the previously designated hedged cash flows occur unless it was determined that transaction was probable to not occur, whereby any unrealized gains and losses in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to earnings. For additional information on the Companys derivative activities, see Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company sponsors stock plans under which incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted stock may be granted periodically to certain employees. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions whereby the fair value of the award at grant date is expensed over the awards vesting period. Additionally, the Company estimates the number of awards for which it is probable that service will be rendered and adjusts compensation cost accordingly. Estimated forfeitures are subsequently adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures. For additional information on the Companys stock-based employee compensation plans, see Note
16
, Employee Benefit Plans.
Employee Benefits
Employee benefits expense includes the net periodic benefit costs associated with the pension, supplemental retirement, and other postretirement benefit plans, as well as contributions under the defined contribution plan, the amortization of restricted stock, stock option awards, and costs of other employee benefits. For additional information on the Company's employee benefit plans, see Note
16
, Employee Benefit Plans.
Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign denominated assets and liabilities resulting from foreign currency transactions are valued using period end foreign exchange rates and the associated interest income or expense is determined using approximate weighted average exchange rates for the period. The Company may elect to enter into foreign currency derivatives to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. The derivative contracts are accounted for at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from such valuations are included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
Fair Value
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Examples of these include derivative instruments, AFS and trading securities, certain LHFI and LHFS, certain issuances of long-term debt, brokered deposits, and MSR assets. Fair value is used on a non-recurring basis as a measurement basis either when assets are evaluated for impairment, the basis of accounting is LOCOM or for disclosure purposes. Examples of these non-recurring uses of fair value include certain LHFS and LHFI, OREO, goodwill, intangible assets, nonmarketable equity securities, certain partnership investments and long-lived assets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value.
The Company applied the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1  Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments or futures contracts.
Level 2  Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.
Level 3  Assets or liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
To determine the fair value measurement for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. If available, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, the Company uses alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement for those assets and liabilities that are either not actively traded in observable markets or for which market observable inputs are
12

not available. For additional information on the Companys valuation of its assets and liabilities held at fair value, see Note

Accounting Policies Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditors Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring. The ASU provides additional guidance to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a TDR, both for purposes of recognizing loan losses and additional disclosures regarding TDRs. A modification of a credit arrangement constitutes a TDR if the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and the Company grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The clarifications for classification apply to all restructurings occurring on or after January 1, 2011. The measurement of impairment for those newly identified TDRs was applied prospectively beginning on July 1, 2011. The related disclosures, which were previously deferred by ASU 2011-01, were required for the interim reporting period ending September 30, 2011 and subsequent reporting periods. The required disclosures and impact as a result of adoption are included in Note
6
, Loans. The adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or EPS.
In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which a company sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. The determination of whether the transaction is accounted for as a sale or a collateralized financing is determined by assessing whether the seller retains effective control of the financial instrument. The ASU changes the assessment of effective control by removing the criterion that requires the seller to have the ability to repurchase or redeem financial assets with substantially the same terms, even in the event of default by the buyer and the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. The Company will apply the new guidance to repurchase agreements entered into or amended after January 1, 2012. The adoption of the ASU did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or EPS.
In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The primary purpose of the ASU is to conform the language in the fair value measurements guidance in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The ASU also clarifies how to apply existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. Further, the ASU requires additional disclosures about transfers between level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, quantitative information for level 3 inputs, and the level of the fair value measurement hierarchy for items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but for which the fair value is required to be disclosed. The ASU is effective for the interim reporting period ending March 31, 2012. The Company has adopted the standard as of January 1, 2012. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or EPS.
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The ASU requires presentation of the components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements. The update does not change the items presented in OCI and does not affect the calculation or reporting of EPS. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassification of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards update No. 2011-05," which deferred the effective date for the amendments to the reclassification of items out of AOCI. The guidance, with the exception of reclassification adjustments, is effective on January 1, 2012 and must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company has adopted the standard as of January 1, 2012. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or EPS.
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The ASU amends interim and annual goodwill impairment testing requirements. Under the ASU, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests beginning January 1, 2012. The Company has adopted the standard as of January 1, 2012 and will apply the new guidance to future goodwill impairment testing, but the Company does not expect the standard to have a substantive impact on its goodwill impairment evaluation.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, "Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." The ASU requires additional disclosures about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The ASU is effective for the interim reporting period ending March 31, 2013 with retrospective disclosure for all comparative periods presented. The Company is evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, it is not expected to materially impact the Company's financial position, results of operations, or EPS.

Securities in an Unrealized Loss Position
The Company held certain investment securities having unrealized loss positions. Market changes in interest rates and credit spreads will result in temporary unrealized losses as the market price of securities fluctuates. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company did not intend to sell these securities nor was it more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery or maturity. The Company has reviewed its portfolio for OTTI in accordance with the accounting policies outlined in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies.
1
Includes OTTI securities for which credit losses have been recorded in earnings in current or prior periods.
The Company adopted the updated accounting guidance for determining OTTI on securities on April 1, 2009, and in conjunction therewith, analyzed the securities for which it had previously recognized OTTI and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment, representing the non-credit component of OTTI of
$8 million
, net of tax. The Company had previously recorded the non-credit component as impairment through earnings; therefore, this amount was reclassified from retained earnings to AOCI.
Unrealized losses on securities that have been in a temporarily impaired position for longer than twelve months include municipal ARS and one ABS collateralized by 1999 vintage home equity loans. The municipal securities are backed by investment grade rated obligors; however, the fair value of these securities continues to be impacted by the lack of a functioning ARS market and
18
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
the extension of time for expected refinance and repayment. No credit loss is expected on these securities. The ABS is also highly-rated, continues to receive timely principal and interest payments, and is evaluated quarterly for credit impairment. Cash flow analysis shows that the underlying collateral can withstand highly stressed loss assumptions without incurring a credit loss.
The portion of unrealized losses on securities that have been other-than-temporarily impaired that relates to factors other than credit are recorded in AOCI. Losses related to credit impairment on these securities is determined through estimated cash flow analyses and have been recorded in earnings in current or prior periods. The unrealized OTTI loss relating to private MBS as of
December 31, 2011
, includes purchased and retained interests from 2007 vintage securitizations. The unrealized OTTI loss relating to ABS is related to
four
securities within the portfolio that are 2003 and 2004 vintage home equity issuances. The expectation of cash flows for the previously impaired ABS securities has improved such that the amount of expected credit losses was reduced, and the expected increase in cash flows will be accreted into earnings as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the securities.
Realized Gains and Losses and Other-than-Temporarily Impaired Securities
The securities that gave rise to the
$6 million
credit impairment recognized during the
year ended
December 31, 2011
consisted of private MBS with a fair value of
$167 million
at
December 31, 2011
. The securities impacted by credit impairment during the
year ended
December 31, 2010
, consisted of private MBS with a fair value of
$1 million
as of
December 31, 2010
, and
$311 million
as of December 31, 2009. Credit impairment that is determined through the use of cash flow models is estimated using cash flows on security specific collateral and the transaction structure. Future expected credit losses are determined by using various assumptions, the most significant of which include current default rates, prepayment rates, and loss severities. For the majority of the securities that the Company has reviewed for credit-related OTTI, credit information is available and modeled at the loan level underlying each security, and the Company also considers information such as loan to collateral values, FICO scores, and geographic considerations such as home price appreciation/depreciation. These inputs are updated on a regular basis to ensure the most current credit and other assumptions are utilized in the analysis. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, the expected cash flows are then discounted at the securitys initial effective interest rate to arrive at a present value amount. OTTI credit losses reflect the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of these securities. During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
, and 2009, all OTTI recognized in earnings on private MBS have underlying collateral of residential mortgage loans securitized in 2007. The majority of the OTTI was taken on private MBS which were originated by the Company and, therefore, have geographic concentrations in the Companys primary footprint. Additionally, the Company has not purchased new private MBS during the
year ended
December 31, 2011
, and continues to reduce existing exposure primarily through paydowns.
 
1
The initial OTTI amount represents the excess of the amortized cost over the fair value of AFS debt securities. For subsequent impairments of the same security, amount represents additional declines in the fair value subsequent to the previously recorded OTTI, if applicable, until such time the security is no longer in an unrealized loss position.
The Company held stock in the FHLB of Atlanta totaling
$342 million
and
$298 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. The Company accounts for the stock based on relevant accounting guidance, which requires the investment be carried at cost and be evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. The Company evaluated its holdings in FHLB stock at
December 31, 2011
and believes its holdings in the stock are ultimately recoverable at par. Additionally, the Company does not have operational or liquidity needs that would require a redemption of the stock in the foreseeable future and therefore determined that the stock was not other-than-temporarily impaired.

- LOANS
Composition of Loan Portfolio
The composition of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31 is shown in the following table:
1
Includes
$431 million
and
$488 million
of loans carried at fair value at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company had pledged
$51.4 billion
and
$50.2 billion
of net eligible loan collateral to support
$34.8 billion
and
$31.2 billion
in available borrowing capacity at either the Federal Reserve discount window or the FHLB of Atlanta, respectively. Of the available borrowing capacity,
$7.0 billion
and
$34 million
of FHLB advances were outstanding and
$1.8 billion
and
$6.1 billion
of undrawn FHLB letters of credit were outstanding as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
During the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company transferred
$63 million
and
$213 million
, respectively, in LHFS to LHFI. During the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company transferred
$754 million
and
$346 million
, respectively, in LHFI to LHFS. Additionally, during the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company sold
$725 million
and
$740 million
in loans and leases that had been held for investment at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
for gains of
$22 million
and
$6 million
, respectively.
Credit Quality Evaluation
The Company evaluates the credit quality of its loan portfolio by employing a dual internal risk rating system, which assigns both PD and LGD ratings to derive expected losses. Assignment of PD and LGD ratings are predicated upon numerous factors, including consumer credit risk scores, rating agency information, borrower/guarantor financial capacity, LTV ratios, collateral type, debt service coverage ratios, collection experience, other internal metrics/analysis and qualitative assessments.
For the commercial portfolio, the Company believes that the most appropriate credit quality indicator is the individual loans risk assessment expressed according to regulatory agency classification, Pass or Criticized. The Company's risk rating system is granular, with multiple risk ratings in both the Pass and Criticized categories. Pass ratings reflect relatively low expectations of default. The granularity in Pass ratings assists in the establishment of pricing, loan structures, approval requirements, reserves and ongoing credit management requirements.
21
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Criticized assets have a higher PD. The Company conforms to the following regulatory classifications for Criticized assets: Other Assets Especially Mentioned (or Special Mention), Adversely Classified, Doubtful, and Loss. However, for the purposes of disclosure, management believes the most meaningful distinction within the Criticized categories is between Accruing Criticized (which includes Special Mention and a portion of Adversely Classified) and Non-Performing (which includes a portion of Adversely Classified, Doubtful, and Loss). This distinction identifies those higher risk loans for which there is a basis to believe that the Company will collect all amounts due from those where full collection is less certain.
Risk ratings are refreshed at least annually, or more frequently as appropriate, based upon considerations such as market conditions, loan characteristics and portfolio trends. In addition, management routinely reviews portfolio risk ratings, trends and concentrations to support risk identification and mitigation activities.
For consumer and residential loans, the Company believes that consumer credit risk, as assessed by the FICO scoring method, is a relevant credit quality indicator. FICO scores are obtained at origination as part of the Companys formal underwriting process, and refreshed FICO scores are obtained by the Company at least quarterly. However, for government guaranteed student loans, the Company monitors the credit quality based primarily on delinquency status, as it is a more relevant indicator of credit quality due to the government guarantee. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
79%
and
77%
, respectively, of the guaranteed student loan portfolio was current with respect to payments; however, the loss exposure to the Company was mitigated by the government guarantee.
LHFI by credit quality indicator at December 31 are shown in the tables below:
1
For substantially all loans with refreshed FICO scores below 620, the borrowers FICO score at the time of origination exceeded 620 but has since deteriorated as the loan has seasoned.
2
Excludes
$6.7 billion
and
$4.5 billion
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, of guaranteed residential loans. At both

Impaired Loans
A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the agreement. Commercial nonaccrual loans greater than
$4 million
and certain consumer, residential, and commercial loans whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually evaluated for impairment. Smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are not included in the following tables. Additionally, the tables below exclude guaranteed student loans and guaranteed residential mortgages for which there was nominal risk of principal loss.

$132 million
and
$195 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Restructured Loans
TDRs are loans in which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company has granted an economic concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. When loans are modified under the terms of a TDR, the Company typically offers the borrower an extension of the loan maturity date and/or a reduction in the original contractual interest rate. In certain limited situations, the Company may offer to restructure a commercial loan in a manner that ultimately results in the forgiveness of contractually specified principal balances.
As a result of adopting newly issued accounting guidance during 2011 that clarifies a creditor's determination of whether a restructuring is a TDR, the Company reassessed all loan restructurings that occurred between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2011 for identification as TDRs. The reassessment resulted in the identification of
$93 million
of additional TDRs as of the adoption date of July 1, 2011. During the third quarter, these loans were evaluated for impairment and an incremental allowance of
$4 million
was recognized.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company had
$5 million
and
$15 million
, respectively, in commitments to lend additional funds to debtors owing receivables whose terms have been modified in a TDR.
The number and amortized cost of loans modified under the terms of a TDR during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, by type of modification, are shown in the following tables:
1
Restructured loans which had forgiveness of amounts contractually due under the terms of the loan typically have had multiple concessions including rate modifications and/or term extensions. The total amount of charge-offs associated with principal forgiveness for the Commercial segment during the
year ended December 31, 2011
was $
14 million
, substantially all of which related to Commercial construction. There was no principal forgiveness for Residential or Consumer loans during the
year ended December 31, 2011
.
2
Restructured loans which had a modification of the loan's contractual interest rate may also have had an extension of the loan's contractual maturity date and/or other concessions. The financial effect of modifying the interest rate on the loans modified as a TDR was immaterial to the financial statements during the
year ended December 31, 2011
.
26
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The preceding table represents loans modified under the terms of a TDR during the
year ended December 31, 2011
, whereas the following table represents loans modified as a TDR over a longer time period between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011 that became 90 days or more delinquent during the
year ended December 31, 2011
.
The majority of loans that were modified and subsequently became 90 days or more delinquent have remained on nonaccrual status since the time of modification.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company does not have a significant concentration of risk to any individual client except for the U.S. government and its agencies. However, a geographic concentration arises because the Company operates primarily in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. The Company engages in limited international banking activities. The Companys total cross-border outstanding loans were
$630 million
and
$446 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
The major concentrations of credit risk for the Company arise by collateral type in relation to loans and credit commitments. The only significant concentration that exists is in loans secured by residential real estate. At
December 31, 2011
, the Company owned
$46.7 billion
in residential loans, representing
38%
of total LHFI, and had
$12.7 billion
in commitments to extend credit on home equity lines and
$7.8 billion
in mortgage loan commitments. Of the residential loans owned at
December 31, 2011
,
14%
were guaranteed by a federal agency or a GSE. At
December 31, 2010
, the Company owned
$46.5 billion
in residential real estate loans, representing
40%
of total LHFI, and had
$13.6 billion
in commitments to extend credit on home equity lines and
$9.2 billion
in mortgage loan commitments. Of the residential loans owned at
December 31, 2010
,
10%
were guaranteed by a federal agency or a GSE.
Included in the residential mortgage portfolio were
$14.7 billion
and
$16.1 billion
of mortgage loans at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, that included terms such as an interest only feature, a high LTV ratio, or a junior lien position that may increase the Companys exposure to credit risk and result in a concentration of credit risk. Of these mortgage loans,
$9.4 billion
and
$11.0 billion
were interest only loans, primarily with a ten year interest only period. Approximately
$1.9 billion
of those interest only loans as of
December 31, 2011
and
$2.2 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
, were loans with no mortgage insurance and were either first liens with combined original LTV ratios in excess of 80% or were junior liens. Additionally, the Company owned approximately
$5.3 billion
and
$5.0 billion
of amortizing loans with no mortgage insurance as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, comprised of first liens with combined original LTV ratios in excess of 80% and junior liens. Despite changes in underwriting guidelines that have curtailed the origination of high LTV loans, the balances of such loans with no mortgage insurance have increased as the benefits of mortgage insurance covering certain junior lien mortgage loans have been exhausted, resulting in the loans effectively no longer being insured.

- ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
The allowance for credit losses consists of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. Activity in the allowance for credit losses at December 31 is summarized in the table below:
1
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recognized the (benefit)/provision for unfunded commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Considering the immateriality of this provision prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, the (benefit)/provision for unfunded commitments remains classified within other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
2
The unfunded commitments reserve is separately recognized in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Activity in the ALLL by segment at December 31 is presented in the tables below:
As further discussed in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, the ALLL is composed of both specific allowances for certain nonaccrual loans and TDRs, and general allowances grouped into loan pools based on similar characteristics. No allowance is required for loans carried at fair value. Additionally, the Company does not record an allowance for loan products that are guaranteed by government agencies, as there is nominal risk of principal loss.

 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative. As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Company's reporting units with goodwill balances were Branch Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, CIB, and W&IM. Based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of September 30, 2011, we determined there is no goodwill impairment as the fair value for all reporting units is in excess of the respective reporting unit's carrying value by the following percentages:
Branch Banking            
12%
        
Diversified Commercial Banking    
27%
CIB                
36%
W&IM                
150%
The Company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2011, and it determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2011. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the year ended December 31 are as follows:
Other Intangible Assets
Changes in the carrying amounts of other intangible assets for the year ended December 31 are as follows:
 
1
Primarily reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, due to changes in interest rates.
2
Represents changes due to the collection of expected cash flows, net of accretion, due to the passage of time.
The estimated future amortization expense for intangible assets is as follows:
 
Mortgage Servicing Rights
The Company retains MSRs from certain of its sales or securitizations of residential mortgage loans. MSRs on residential mortgage loans are the only servicing assets capitalized by the Company and are classified within intangible assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Income earned by the Company on its MSRs is derived primarily from contractually specified mortgage servicing fees and late fees, net of curtailment costs. Such income earned for the year ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
was
$364 million
,
$399 million
, and
$354 million
, respectively. These amounts are reported in mortgage servicing related income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
As of
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, the total unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced was
$157.8 billion
,
$167.2 billion
, and
$178.9 billion
, respectively. Included in these amounts were
$124.1 billion
,
$134.1 billion
, and
$146.7 billion
as of
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively, of loans serviced for third parties. During the year ended
December 31, 2011
, the Company sold MSRs on residential loans with an unpaid principal balance of
$2.3 billion
. Because MSRs are reported at fair value, the sale did not have a material impact on mortgage servicing related income.
A summary of the key characteristics, inputs, and economic assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Companys MSRs as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, and the sensitivity of the fair values to immediate
10%
and
20%
adverse changes in those assumptions are shown in the table below. Approximately
80%
of the decrease in fair value during the year ended December 31, 2011 was driven by an assumed increase in prepayment speeds as a result of lower interest rates.
Additionally, the balance of loans serviced for others declined
7%
during 2011.
 
The above sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Additionally, the sensitivities above do not include the effect of hedging activity undertaken by the Company to offset changes in the fair value of MSRs. See Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further information regarding these hedging transactions.

- CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and related Variable Interest Entities
The Company has transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans, student loans, commercial and corporate loans, and CDO securities in sale or securitization transactions in which the Company has, or had, continuing involvement. All such transfers have been accounted for as sales by the Company. The Companys continuing involvement in such transfers includes owning certain beneficial interests, including senior and subordinate debt instruments as well as equity interests, servicing or collateral manager responsibilities, and guarantee or recourse arrangements. Except as specifically noted herein, the Company is not required to provide additional financial support to any of the entities to which the Company has transferred financial assets, nor has the Company provided any support it was not otherwise obligated to provide. In accordance with the accounting guidance related to transfers of financial assets that became effective on January 1, 2010, upon completion of transfers of assets that satisfy the conditions to be reported as a sale, the Company derecognizes the transferred assets and recognizes at fair value any beneficial interests in the transferred financial assets such as trading assets or securities AFS as well as servicing rights retained and guarantee liabilities incurred. See Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, for further discussion of the Companys fair value methodologies.
When evaluating transfers and other transactions with VIEs for consolidation, the Company first determines if it has a VI in the VIE. A VI is typically in the form of securities representing retained interests in the transferred assets and, at times, servicing rights and collateral manager fees. If the Company has a VI in the entity, it then evaluates whether or not it has both (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE to determine if the Company should consolidate the VIE.
Below is a summary of transfers of financial assets to VIEs for which the Company has retained some level of continuing involvement.
Residential Mortgage Loans
The Company typically transfers first lien residential mortgage loans in conjunction with Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac securitization transactions whereby the loans are exchanged for cash or securities that are readily redeemed for cash proceeds and servicing rights. The securities issued through these transactions are guaranteed by the issuer and, as such, under seller/servicer agreements the Company is required to service the loans in accordance with the issuers servicing guidelines and standards. The Company sold residential mortgage loans to these entities, which resulted in pre-tax gains of
$397 million
,
$588 million
, and
$707 million
, including servicing rights for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively. These gains are included within mortgage production related (loss)/income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). These gains include the change in value of the loans as a result of changes in interest rates from the time the related IRLCs were issued to the borrowers but do not include the results of hedging activities initiated by the Company to mitigate this market risk. See Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion of the Companys hedging activities. As seller, the Company has made certain representations and warranties with respect to the originally transferred loans, including those transferred under Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac programs, which are discussed in Note
18
, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees.
In a limited number of securitizations, the Company has transferred loans to trusts, which previously qualified as QSPEs, sponsored by the Company. These trusts issue securities which are ultimately supported by the loans in the underlying trusts. In these transactions, the Company has received securities representing retained interests in the transferred loans in addition to cash and servicing rights in exchange for the transferred loans. The received securities are carried at fair value as either trading assets or securities AFS. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of securities received totaled
$104 million
and were valued using a third party pricing service. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of securities received was
$193 million
. At December 31, 2010, securities with a fair value of
$175 million
were valued using a third party pricing service. The remaining
$18 million
in securities consisted of subordinate interests from a 2003 securitization of prime fixed and floating rate loans and were valued using a discounted cash flow model that uses historically derived prepayment rates and credit loss assumptions along with estimates of current market discount rates. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company exercised its clean up call rights from the 2003 securitization and repurchased the remaining residential mortgage loans. The exercise of the clean up call was not material to the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
The Company evaluated these securitization transactions for consolidation under the VIE consolidation guidance. As servicer of the underlying loans, the Company is generally deemed to have power over the securitization. However, if a single party, such as the issuer or the master servicer, effectively controls the servicing activities or has the unilateral ability to terminate the Company as servicer without cause, then that party is deemed to have power. In almost all of its securitization transactions, the Company does not have power over the VIE as a result of these rights held by the master servicer. In certain transactions, the Company does have power as the servicer; however, the Company does not also have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the securitization. The absorption of losses and the receipt of benefits would generally manifest itself through the retention of senior or subordinated interests. No events occurred during the
year ended December 31, 2011
that would change the Companys previous conclusion that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of these securitization entities. Total assets as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
of the unconsolidated trusts in which the Company has a VI are
$529 million
and
$651 million
, respectively.
The Companys maximum exposure to loss related to the unconsolidated VIEs in which it holds a VI is comprised of the loss of value of any interests it retains and any repurchase obligations it incurs as a result of a breach of its representations and warranties.
Commercial and Corporate Loans
In 2007, the Company completed a
$1.9 billion
structured sale of corporate loans to multi-seller CP conduits, which are VIEs administered by unrelated third parties. From the sale, the Company retained a
3%
residual interest in the pool of loans transferred, which does not constitute a VI in the third party conduits as it relates to the unparticipated portion of the loans. In conjunction with the transfer of the loans, the Company also provided commitments in the form of liquidity facilities to these conduits. In January 2010, the administrator of the conduits drew on these commitments in full, resulting in a funded loan to the conduits that was recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 31, 2010
, the market value of the residual interest was
$13 million
. During the first quarter of
2011
, the Company exercised its clean up call rights on the structured participation and repurchased the remaining corporate loans. In conjunction with the clean up call, the outstanding amount of the liquidity facilities and the residual interest were paid off. The exercise of the clean up call was not material to the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
The Company has involvement with CLO entities that own commercial leveraged loans and bonds, certain of which were transferred by the Company to the CLOs. In addition to retaining certain securities issued by the CLOs, the Company also acts as collateral manager for these CLOs. The securities retained by the Company and the fees received as collateral manager represent a VI in the CLOs, which are considered to be VIEs.
In accordance with the VIE consolidation guidance beginning January 1, 2010, the Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of, and thus, would consolidate one of these CLOs as it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the CLO. In addition to fees received as collateral manager, including eligibility for performance incentive fees, and owning certain preference shares, the Companys multi-seller conduit, Three Pillars, owns a senior interest in the CLO, resulting in economics that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On January 1, 2010, the Company consolidated
$307 million
in total assets and
$279 million
in net liabilities of the CLO entity. The Company elected to consolidate the CLO at fair value and to carry the financial assets and financial liabilities of the CLO at fair value subsequent to adoption. The initial consolidation of the CLO did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the CLO are loans and issued debt, respectively. The loans are classified within LHFS at fair value and the debt is included within long-term debt at fair value on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 19, Fair Value Election and Measurement, for a discussion of the Companys methodologies for estimating the fair values of these financial instruments). At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected
$315 million
and
$316 million
, respectively, of loans held by the CLO and
$289 million
and
$290 million
, respectively, of debt issued by the CLO. The Company is not obligated, contractually or otherwise, to provide financial support to this VIE nor has it previously provided support to this VIE. Further, creditors of the VIE have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, as the liabilities of the CLO are paid only to the extent of available cash flows from the CLOs assets.
For the remaining CLOs, which are also considered to be VIEs, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entities that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company was able to liquidate a number of its positions in these CLO preference shares during 2010. Its remaining preference share exposure was valued at
$2 million
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Upon liquidation of the preference shares, the Companys only remaining involvement with these VIEs was through its collateral manager role. The Company receives fees for managing the assets of these vehicles; these fees are considered adequate compensation and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide such services. The fees received by the Company from these entities are recorded as trust and investment management income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss). Senior fees earned by the Company are generally not considered at risk; however, subordinate fees earned by the Company are subject to the availability of cash flows and to the priority of payments. The estimated assets and liabilities of these entities that were not included on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets were
$2.0 billion
and
$1.9 billion
, respectively, at
December 31, 2011
, and
$2.1 billion
and
$2.0 billion
, respectively, at
December 31, 2010
. The Company is not obligated to provide any support to these entities, nor has it previously provided support to these entities. No events occurred during the year ended
December 31, 2011
that would change the Companys previous conclusion that it is not the primary beneficiary of any of these securitization entities.
Student Loans
In 2006, the Company completed a securitization of government-guaranteed student loans through a transfer of loans to a securitization SPE, which previously qualified as a QSPE, and retained the related residual interest in the SPE. The Company, as master servicer of the loans in the SPE, has agreed to service each loan consistent with the guidelines determined by the applicable government agencies in order to maintain the government guarantee. The Company and the SPE have entered into an agreement to have the loans subserviced by an unrelated third party.
The Company concluded that this securitization of government-guaranteed student loans (the Student Loan entity) should be consolidated as it has both power over the entity through its role as master servicer and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits through the retention of the residual interest. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the Student Loan entity at its unpaid principal amount as of September 30, 2010, resulting in incremental total assets and total liabilities of approximately
$490 million
and an immaterial impact on shareholders equity. The consolidation of the Student Loan entity had no impact on the Companys earnings or cash flows that results from its involvement with this VIE. The primary balance sheet impacts from consolidating the Student Loan entity were increases in LHFI, the related ALLL, and long-term debt. Additionally, the Companys ownership of the residual interest in the SPE, previously classified in trading assets, was eliminated upon consolidation and the assets and liabilities of the Student Loan entity are recorded on a cost basis. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets reflected
$438 million
and
$479 million
, respectively, of assets held by the Student Loan entity and
$433 million
and
$474 million
, respectively, of debt issued by the Student Loan entity.
Payments from the assets in the SPE must first be used to settle the obligations of the SPE, with any remaining payments remitted to the Company as the owner of the residual interest. To the extent that losses occur on the SPEs assets, the SPE has recourse to the federal government as the guarantor up to a maximum guarantee amount of
97%
. Losses in excess of the government guarantee reduce the amount of available cash payable to the Company as the owner of the residual interest. To the extent that losses result from a breach of the master servicers servicing responsibilities, the SPE has recourse to the Company; the SPE may require the Company to repurchase the loan from the SPE at par value. If the breach was caused by the subservicer, the Company has recourse to seek reimbursement from the subservicer up to the guaranteed amount. The Companys maximum exposure to loss related to the SPE is represented by the potential losses resulting from a breach of servicing responsibilities. To date, all loss claims filed with the guarantor that have been denied due to servicing errors have either been cured or reimbursement has been provided to the Company by the subservicer. The Company is not obligated to provide any noncontractual support to this entity, and it has not provided any such support.
CDO Securities
The Company has transferred bank trust preferred securities in securitization transactions. The majority of these transfers occurred between 2002 and 2005 with one transaction completed in 2007. The Company retained equity interests in certain of these entities and also holds certain senior interests that were acquired during 2008 and 2011 in conjunction with its acquisition of assets from the ARS transactions discussed in Note
20
, Contingencies. The Company is not obligated to provide any support to these entities and its maximum exposure to loss at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
includes current senior interests held in trading securities, which had a fair value of
$43 million
as of
December 31, 2011
and
$29 million
as of
December 31, 2010
.
The assumptions and inputs considered by the Company in valuing this retained interest include prepayment speeds, credit losses, and the discount rate. While all the underlying collateral is currently eligible for repayment by the obligor, given the nature of the collateral and the current repricing environment, the Company assumed no prepayment would occur before the final maturity, which is approximately
22
years on a weighted average basis. Due to the seniority of the interests in the structure, current estimates of credit losses in the underlying collateral could withstand a
20%
adverse change in the default assumption without the securities incurring a valuation loss assuming all other assumptions remain constant. Therefore, the key assumption in valuing these securities was the assumed discount rate, which was estimated to range from
8%
to
12%
over
LIBOR
at
December 31, 2011
compared to
14%
to
16%
over
LIBOR
at
December 31, 2010
. This significant change in the discount rate was supported by a return to liquidity in the market for similar interests. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, a
20%
adverse change in the assumed discount rate results in declines of approximately
$8 million
and
$5 million
, respectively, in the fair value of these securities. Although the impact of each assumption change in isolation is minimal, the underlying collateral of the VIEs is highly concentrated and as a result, the default or deferral of certain large exposures may have a more dramatic effect on the discount rate than the
20%
discussed above. Due to this, we estimate that if each of the retained positions experienced two additional large deferrals or default of an underlying collateral obligation, the fair value of the retained ARS would decline approximately
$14 million
.
The total assets of the trust preferred CDO entities in which the Company has remaining exposure to loss was
$1.2 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
$1.3 billion
at
December 31, 2010
. The Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any of these VIEs as the Company lacks the power to direct the significant activities of any of the VIEs. No events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2011 that changed either the Companys sale accounting or the Companys conclusions that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
The following tables present certain information related to the Companys asset transfers in which it has continuing economic involvement for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
:
 
Portfolio balances and delinquency balances based on accruing loans 90 days or more past due and all nonaccrual loans as of December 31 and net charge-offs related to managed portfolio loans (both those that are owned or consolidated by the Company and those that have been transferred) for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
are as follows:

Excludes loans that have completed the foreclosure or short sale process (i.e., involuntary prepayments).
Other Variable Interest Entities
In addition to the Companys involvement with certain VIEs related to transfers of financial assets, the Company also has involvement with VIEs from other business activities.
Three Pillars Funding, LLC
SunTrust assists in providing liquidity to select corporate clients by directing them to a multi-seller CP conduit, Three Pillars. Three Pillars provides financing for direct purchases of financial assets originated and serviced by SunTrusts corporate clients by issuing CP.
The Company has determined that Three Pillars is a VIE as Three Pillars has not issued sufficient equity at risk. In accordance with the VIE consolidation guidance, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of Three Pillars as certain subsidiaries have both the power to direct its significant activities and own potentially significant VIs. The assets and liabilities of Three Pillars were consolidated by the Company at their unpaid principal amounts at January 1, 2010; upon consolidation, the Company recorded an allowance for loan losses on
$1.7 billion
of secured loans that were consolidated at that time, resulting in an immaterial transition adjustment, which was recorded in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity.
The Companys involvement with Three Pillars includes the following activities: services related to the administration of Three Pillars activities and client referrals to Three Pillars; the issuing of letters of credit, which provide partial credit protection to the CP holders; and providing liquidity arrangements that would provide funding to Three Pillars in the event it can no longer issue CP or in certain other circumstances. The Companys activities with Three Pillars generated total revenue for the Company, net of direct salary and administrative costs, of
$65 million
,
$68 million
, and
$59 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively.
At
December 31, 2011
, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets included approximately
$2.9 billion
of secured loans held by Three Pillars, which are included within commercial loans. Other assets and liabilities were not material to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no CP was outstanding at
December 31, 2011
. At December 31, 2010, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets included commercial loans and short-term borrowings of
$2.4 billion
and
$99 million
, respectively. Short-term borrowings, excluding intercompany liabilities, consisted of the CP issued by Three Pillars to third parties.
No
losses on any of Three Pillars assets were incurred during the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
.
Funding commitments extended by Three Pillars to its customers totaled
$4.1 billion
with outstanding receivables totaling
$2.9 billion
at
December 31, 2011
; the majority of which generally carry initial terms of
one
to
three
years and may be repaid or refinanced at any time. At
December 31, 2010
, Three Pillars had funding commitments and outstanding receivables totaling
$4.1 billion
and
$2.4 billion
, respectively. The majority of the commitments are backed by trade receivables and commercial loans that have been originated by companies operating across a number of industries. Trade receivables and commercial loans collateralize
40%
and
20%
, respectively, of the outstanding commitments, as of
December 31, 2011
, compared to
48%
and
14%
, respectively, as of
December 31, 2010
. Total assets supporting outstanding commitments have a weighted average life of
2.8
years and
2.3
years at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
Each transaction added to Three Pillars is typically structured to a minimum implied A/A2 rating according to established credit and underwriting policies as approved by credit risk management and monitored on a regular basis to ensure compliance with each transactions terms and conditions. Typically, transactions contain dynamic credit enhancement features that provide increased credit protection in the event asset performance deteriorates. If asset performance deteriorates beyond predetermined covenant levels, the transaction could become ineligible for continued funding by Three Pillars. This could result in the transaction being amended with the approval of credit risk management, or Three Pillars could terminate the transaction and enforce any rights or remedies available, including amortization of the transaction or liquidation of the collateral. Three Pillars also has the option to fund under the liquidity facility provided by the Bank in connection with the transaction and may be required to fund under the liquidity facility if the transaction remains in breach. In addition, each commitment renewal requires credit risk management approval. The Company is not aware of unfavorable trends related to Three Pillars assets for which the Company expects to suffer material losses. For the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, there were no writedowns of Three Pillars' assets.
The assets of Three Pillars generally provide the sources of cash flows for the CP. However, the Company has issued commitments in the form of liquidity facilities and other credit enhancements to support the operations of Three Pillars. Due to the Companys consolidation of Three Pillars as of January 1, 2010, these commitments are eliminated in consolidation for U.S. GAAP purposes. The liquidity commitments are revolving facilities that are sized based on the current commitments provided by Three Pillars to its customers. The liquidity facilities may generally be used if new CP cannot be issued by Three Pillars to repay maturing CP. However, the liquidity facilities are available in all circumstances, except certain bankruptcy-related events with respect to Three Pillars. Draws on the facilities are subject to the purchase price (or borrowing base) formula that, in many cases, excludes defaulted assets to the extent that they exceed available over-collateralization in the form of non-defaulted assets, and may also provide the liquidity banks with loss protection equal to a portion of the loss protection provided for in the related securitization agreement. Additionally, there are transaction specific covenants and triggers that are tied to the performance of the assets of the relevant seller/servicer that may result in a transaction termination event, which, if continuing, would require funding through the related liquidity facility. Finally, in a termination event of Three Pillars, such as if its tangible net worth falls below
$5,000
for a period in excess of
15
days, Three Pillars would be unable to issue CP, which would likely result in funding through the liquidity facilities. Draws under the credit enhancement are also available in all circumstances, but are generally used to the extent required to make payment on any maturing CP if there are insufficient funds from collections of receivables or the use of liquidity facilities. The required amount of credit enhancement at Three Pillars will vary from time to time as new receivable pools are purchased or removed from its asset portfolio, but is generally equal to
10%
of the aggregate commitments of Three Pillars.
Due to the consolidation of Three Pillars, the Companys maximum exposure to potential loss was
$4.3 billion
and
$4.2 billion
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, which represents the Companys exposure to the lines of credit that Three Pillars had extended to its clients. The Company did not recognize any liability on its Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the liquidity facilities and other credit enhancements provided to Three Pillars as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, as no amounts had been drawn, nor were any draws probable to occur, such that a loss should have been accrued.
In January 2012, the Company initiated the process of liquidating Three Pillars. The commitments and outstanding loans of Three Pillars will be transferred to the Bank. The Bank will fund the loans through wholesale funding sources, and Three Pillars' CP will be repaid in full. The liquidation is expected to be complete by the second quarter of 2012, and upon completion, the Bank will terminate the liquidity arrangements and standby letter of credit. The liquidation is not expected to have a material impact to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Total Return Swaps
The Company recommenced involvement with various VIEs related to its TRS business during 2010. Under the matched book TRS business model, the VIEs purchase assets (typically loans) from the market, which are identified by third party clients, that serve as the underlying reference assets for a TRS between the VIE and the Company and a mirror TRS between the Company and its third party clients. The TRS contracts between the VIEs and the Company hedge the Companys exposure to the TRS contracts with its third party clients. These third parties are not related parties to the Company, nor are they and the Company de facto agents of each other. In order for the VIEs to purchase the reference assets, the Company provides senior financing, in the form of demand notes, to these VIEs. The TRS contracts pass through interest and other cash flows on the assets owned by the VIEs to the third parties, along with exposing the third parties to depreciation on the assets and providing them with the rights to appreciation on the assets. The terms of the TRS contracts require the third parties to post initial collateral, in addition to ongoing margin as the fair values of the underlying assets change. Although the Company has always caused the VIEs to purchase a reference asset in response to the addition of a reference asset by its third party clients, there is no legal obligation between the Company and its third party clients for the Company to purchase the reference assets or for the Company to cause the VIEs to purchase the assets.
The Company considered the VIE consolidation guidance, which requires an evaluation of the substantive contractual and non-contractual aspects of transactions involving VIEs established subsequent to January 1, 2010. The Company and its third party clients are the only VI holders. As such, the Company evaluated the nature of all VIs and other interests and involvement with the VIEs, in addition to the purpose and design of the VIEs, relative to the risks they were designed to create. The purpose and design of a VIE are key components of a consolidation analysis and any power should be analyzed based on the substance of that power relative to the purpose and design of the VIE. The VIEs were designed for the benefit of the third parties and would not exist if the Company did not enter into the TRS contracts with the third parties. The activities of the VIEs are restricted to buying and selling reference assets with respect to the TRS contracts entered into between the Company and its third party clients and the risks/benefits of any such assets owned by the VIEs are passed to the third party clients via the TRS contracts. The TRS contracts between the Company and its third party clients have a substantive effect on the design of the overall transaction and the VIEs. Based on its evaluation, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, as the design of the TRS business results in the Company having no substantive power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs.
At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company had
$1.7 billion
and
$972 million
, respectively, in senior financing outstanding to VIEs, which were classified within trading assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and carried at fair value. These VIEs had entered into TRS contracts with the Company with outstanding notional amounts of
$1.6 billion
and
$969 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, and the Company had entered into mirror TRS contracts with its third parties with the same outstanding notional amounts. At
December 31, 2011
, the fair values of these TRS assets and liabilities were
$20 million
and
$17 million
, respectively, and at
December 31, 2010
, the fair values of these TRS assets and liabilities were
$34 million
and
$32 million
, respectively, reflecting the pass-through nature of these structures. The notional amounts of the TRS contracts with the VIEs represent the Companys maximum exposure to loss, although such exposure to loss has been mitigated via the TRS contracts with the third parties. The Company has not provided any support to the VIE that it was not contractually obligated to for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
. For additional information on the Companys TRS with these VIEs, see Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments.
Community Development Investments
As part of its community reinvestment initiatives, the Company invests almost exclusively within its footprint in multi-family affordable housing developments and other community development entities as a limited and/or general partner and/or a debt provider. The Company receives tax credits for various investments. The Company has determined that the related partnerships are VIEs. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company did not provide any financial or other support to its consolidated or unconsolidated investments that it was not previously contractually required to provide.
For partnerships where the Company operates strictly as the general partner, the Company consolidates these partnerships on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the general partner, the Company typically guarantees the tax credits due to the limited partner and is responsible for funding construction and operating deficits. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, total assets, which consist primarily of fixed assets and cash attributable to the consolidated partnerships, were
$5 million
and
$8 million
, respectively, and total liabilities, excluding intercompany liabilities, were
$1 million
. Security deposits from the tenants are recorded as liabilities on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company maintains separate cash accounts to fund these liabilities and these assets are considered restricted. The tenant liabilities and corresponding restricted cash assets were not material as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. While the obligations of the general partner are generally non-recourse to the Company, as the general partner, the Company may from time to time step in when needed to fund deficits. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company did not provide any significant amount of funding as the general partner or to cover any deficits the partnerships may have generated.
For other partnerships, the Company acts only in a limited partnership capacity. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships and accounts for its limited partner interests in accordance with the accounting guidance for investments in affordable housing projects. The general partner or an affiliate of the general partner provides guarantees to the limited partner, which protects the Company from losses attributable to operating deficits, construction deficits and tax credit allocation deficits. Partnership assets of
$1.2 billion
and
$1.1 billion
in these partnerships were not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. These limited partner interests had carrying values of
$194 million
and
$202 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, and are recorded in other assets on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys maximum exposure to loss for these limited partner investments totaled
$472 million
and
$458 million
at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The Companys maximum exposure to loss would be borne by the loss of the limited partnership equity investments along with
$249 million
and
$222 million
of loans, interest-rate swaps or letters of credit issued by the Company to the limited partnerships at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The difference between the maximum exposure to loss and the investment and loan balances is primarily attributable to the unfunded equity commitments. Unfunded equity commitments are amounts that the Company has committed to the partnerships upon the partnerships meeting certain conditions. When these conditions are met, the Company will invest these additional amounts in the partnerships.
Additionally, the Company invests in funds whose purpose is to invest in affordable housing developments as the limited partner investor. The Company owns minority and noncontrolling interests in these funds. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company's investment in these funds totaled
$68 million
and
$62 million
, respectively, and the Company's maximum exposure to loss on its equity investments, which is comprised of its investments in the funds plus any additional unfunded equity commitments, was
$108 million
and
$80 million
, respectively.
When the Company owns both the limited partner and general partner interests or acts as the indemnifying party, the Company consolidates the partnerships. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, total assets, which consist primarily of fixed assets and cash, attributable to the consolidated, non-VIE partnerships were
$360 million
and
$394 million
, respectively, and total liabilities, excluding intercompany liabilities, primarily representing third party borrowings, were
$107 million
and
$123 million
, respectively. See Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement, for further discussion on the impact of impairment charges on affordable housing partnership investments.
Registered and Unregistered Funds Advised by RidgeWorth
RidgeWorth, a registered investment advisor and majority owned subsidiary of the Company, serves as the investment advisor for various private placement, common and collective funds, and registered mutual funds (collectively the Funds). The Company evaluates these Funds to determine if the Funds are VIEs. In February 2010, the FASB issued guidance that defers the application of the existing VIE consolidation guidance for investment funds meeting certain criteria. All of the registered and unregistered Funds advised by RidgeWorth meet the scope exception criteria and thus are not evaluated for consolidation under the guidance. Accordingly, the Company continues to apply the consolidation guidance in effect prior to the issuance of the existing guidance to interests in funds that qualify for the deferral.
The Company has concluded that some of the Funds are VIEs. However, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of these funds as the Company does not absorb a majority of the expected losses nor expected returns of the funds. The Companys exposure to loss is limited to the investment advisor and other administrative fees it earns and if applicable, any equity investments. The total unconsolidated assets of these funds as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
were
$1.1 billion
and
$1.9 billion
, respectively.
The Company does not have any contractual obligation to provide monetary support to any of the Funds. The Company did not provide any significant support, contractual or otherwise, to the Funds during the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
.

$576 million
and
$2.7 billion
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively.
Restrictive provisions of several long-term debt agreements prevent the Company from creating liens on, disposing of, or issuing (except to related parties) voting stock of subsidiaries. Further, there are restrictions on mergers, consolidations, certain leases, sales or transfers of assets, minimum shareholders equity, and maximum borrowings by the Company. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company was in compliance with all covenants and provisions of long-term debt agreements. As currently defined by federal bank regulators, long-term debt of $
1.9 billion
and $
2.4 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively, qualified as Tier 1 capital, and long-term debt of $
1.6 billion
and $
1.8 billion
as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively, qualified as Tier 2 capital. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company had collateral pledged to the FHLB of Atlanta to support $
10.8 billion
of available borrowing capacity with
$27 million
of long-term debt and
$7.0 billion
of short-term debt outstanding at
December 31, 2011
.
The Company does not consolidate certain wholly-owned trusts which had been formed for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. The proceeds from the trust preferred securities issuances were invested in junior subordinated debentures of the Parent Company. The obligations of these debentures constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Parent Company of the trust preferred securities.
During 2011, the Company issued
$1.0 billion
of
3.60%
senior notes that will mature in
2016
, and
$750 million
of
3.50%
senior notes that will mature in
2017
. During the year, a
$2.1 billion
senior note,
$1.1 billion
of foreign denominated debt, and
$852 million
of subordinated debt matured.
Additionally, the Company repurchased and retired
$395 million
and
$101 million
of junior subordinated notes that were due in
2036
and
2042
, respectively,
and recognized a net gain of
$3 million
.
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include obligations to make future payments on lease arrangements, contractual commitments for capital expenditures, and service contracts. As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company had the following in unconditional obligations:
 
1
Amounts do not include accrued interest.

 CAPITAL
In March 2011, the Federal Reserve completed its review of the Companys capital plan in connection with the CCAR. Upon completion of the review, the Federal Reserve did not object to the Companys capital plan as originally submitted in January 2011. As a result, during the first quarter of 2011, the Company completed a
$1.0 billion
common stock offering and a
$1.0 billion
senior debt offering, which pays
3.60%
interest and is due in
2016
.
On March 30, 2011, the Company used the proceeds from these offerings as well as from other available funds to repurchase
$3.5 billion
of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, and
$1.4 billion
of Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D, that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARPs CPP in 2008. As a result of the repurchase of Series C and D Preferred Stock, the Company incurred a one-time non-cash charge to net income/(loss) available to common shareholders of
$74 million
related to accelerating the outstanding discount accretion on the Series C and D Preferred Stock. The discount associated with the Series C and D Preferred Stock was being amortized over a
five
-year period from each respective issuance date using the effective yield method and totaled
$6 million
,
$25 million
and
$23 million
during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
On January 9, 2012, the Company submitted its latest CCAR capital plan which is currently under review by the Federal Reserve.
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements which involve quantitative measures of the Companys assets.
 
Capital Ratios
Capital ratios at December 31, consisted of the following:
Substantially all of the Companys retained earnings are undistributed earnings of the Bank, which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities. There was no capacity for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. At January 1, 2012, retained earnings of the Bank available for payment of cash dividends to the Parent Company under these regulations totaled approximately
$697 million
. Additionally, the Federal Reserve requires the Company to maintain cash reserves. As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, these reserve requirements totaled
$1.7 billion
and
$1.4 billion
, respectively and were fulfilled with a combination of cash on hand and deposits at the Federal Reserve.
Preferred Stock
Preferred stock at December 31 consisted of the following:
On September 12, 2006, the Company issued depositary shares representing ownership interests in
5,000
shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A,
no
par value and
$100,000
liquidation preference per share (the Series A Preferred Stock). The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
three-month LIBOR
plus
0.53%
, or
4.00%
. Dividends on the shares are noncumulative. Shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have priority over the Companys common stock with regard to the payment of dividends. As such, the Company may not pay dividends on or repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of its common stock unless dividends for the Series A Preferred Stock have been declared for that period and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment. On
September 15, 2011
, the Series A Preferred Stock became redeemable at the Companys option at a redemption price equal to
$100,000
per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Except in certain limited circumstances, the Series A Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights. During 2009, the Company repurchased
3,275
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.
On December 15, 2011, the Company issued depositary shares representing ownership interests in
1,025
shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B,
no
par value and
$100,000
liquidation preference per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"). The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
three-month LIBOR
plus
0.65%
, or
4.00%
. Dividends on the shares are noncumulative. Shares of the Series B Preferred Stock have priority over the Company's common stock with regard to the payment of dividends. As such, the Company may not pay dividends on or repurchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of its common stock unless dividends for the Series B Preferred Stock have been declared for that period, and sufficient funds have been set aside to make payment. The Series B Preferred Stock were immediately redeemable upon issuance at the Company's option at a redemption price equal to
$100,000
per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. Except in certain limited circumstances, the Series B Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights.
On November 14, 2008, as part of the CPP established by the U.S. Treasury under the EESA, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Treasury pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury
35,000
shares of the Companys Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, having a liquidation preference of
$100,000
per share (the Series C Preferred Stock), and a
ten
-year warrant to purchase up to
11,891,280
shares of the Companys common stock, par value
$1.00
per share, at an initial exercise price of
$44.15
per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
$3.5 billion
in cash.
On December 31, 2008, as part of the CPP established by the U.S. Treasury under the EESA, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the U.S. Treasury dated December 31, 2008, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury
13,500
shares of the Companys Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, having a liquidation preference of
$100,000
per share (the Series D Preferred Stock), and a
ten
-year warrant to purchase up to
6,008,902
shares of the Companys common stock, par value
$1.00
per share, at an initial exercise price of
$33.70
per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
$1.4 billion
in cash.
The Company repurchased the aforementioned Series C and D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock on March 30, 2011. On September 22, 2011, the U.S. Treasury auctioned a total of
17.9 million
of the Company's warrants to purchase
11.9 million
shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of
$44.15
per share (Series B warrants) and
6
million shares of SunTrust common stock at an exercise price of
$33.70
per share (Series A warrants). The warrants were issued by SunTrust to the U.S. Treasury in connection with its investment in SunTrust Banks, Inc. under the CPP and have expiration dates of November 2018 (Series B) and December 2018 (Series A). In conjunction with the U.S. Treasury's auction, the Company acquired
4
million of the Series A warrants for
$11 million
and retired them.
Common and Preferred Dividends
The Company remains subject to certain restrictions on its ability to increase the dividend on common shares as a result of participating in the U.S. Treasurys CPP. If the Company increases its dividend above
$0.54
per share per quarter prior to the tenth anniversary of its participation in the CPP, then the anti-dilution provision within the warrants issued in connection with the Companys participation in the CPP will require the exercise price and number of shares to be issued upon exercise to be proportionately adjusted. The amount of such adjustment is determined by a formula and depends in part on the extent to which the Company raises its dividend. The formulas are contained in the warrant agreements which were filed as exhibits to Form 8-As filed on September 23, 2011.
During the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, SunTrust paid cash dividends on perpetual preferred stock totaling
$67 million
,
$239 million
and
$246 million
, respectively. SunTrust also declared and paid common dividends totaling
$64 million
, or
$0.12
per common share,
$20 million
, or
$0.04
per common share, and
$83 million
, or
$0.22
per common share during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

- INCOME TAXES
The components of income tax provision included in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) were as follows:
 
The income tax provision does not reflect the tax effects of unrealized gains and losses and other income and expenses recorded in AOCI. For additional information on AOCI, see Note
22
, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
A reconciliation of the expected income tax expense/(benefit) at the statutory federal income tax rate of
35%
to the Companys actual provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate is as follows:
 
1
"NM" - Calculated percentage was not considered to be meaningful
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from differences between the timing of the recognition of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax return purposes. These assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. The net deferred income tax liability is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The significant components of the DTAs and DTLs as of December 31 were as follows:
 
The DTAs include a federal NOL and other federal carryforwards of
$266 million
and
$280 million
as of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively, the majority of which will expire, if not utilized, by 2031. The DTAs also include state NOLs and other state carryforwards of
$197 million
and
$182 million
as of December 31, 2011 and
2010
, respectively. The state carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in varying amounts from 2012 to 2031. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its state carryforwards and certain state DTAs of
$65 million
and
$50 million
, respectively. The Company determined that a valuation allowance is not required for the federal and the remaining state DTAs because it is more likely than not these assets will be realized against future taxable income.
As of
December 31, 2011
and 2010, the Companys liability for UTBs, excluding interest and penalties, was
$133 million
and
$132 million
, respectively. The amount of UTBs that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate was
$90 million
at December 31, 2011. Additionally, the Company had a liability of
$21 million
for interest related to its UTBs at
December 31, 2011
and 2010. Interest income recognized related to UTBs was less than
$1 million
and approximately
$10 million
for the years ended
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. Interest related to UTBs is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. The Company continually evaluates the UTBs associated with its uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the liability for UTBs could decrease during the next 12 months by up to
$40 million
due to completion of tax authority examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitations.
The Company files consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state jurisdictions. The Company's federal income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the IRS for taxable years prior to 2006. The IRS audit of the 2006 federal income tax return is closed, but the return is still subject to examination to the extent of carryback claims. The Company's 2007 through 2009 federal income tax returns are currently under examination by the IRS. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to examination by state and local taxing authorities for taxable years prior to 2006.
The following table provides a rollforward of the Company's federal and state UTBs for the year ended December 31:

- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors various short-term incentive and LTI plans for eligible employees. The Company delivers LTIs through various incentive programs, including stock options, restricted stock, LTI cash, and salary shares. Awards under the LTI cash plan cliff vest over a period of three years from the date of the award and are paid in cash. MIP is the Company's short-term cash incentive plan for key employees that provides for potential annual cash awards based on the Company's performance and/or the achievement of business unit and individual performance objectives. Compensation expense for the MIP and LTI Cash plans was
$116 million
,
$77 million
and
$28 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively.
The terms related to TARP prohibited the payment of any bonus, incentive compensation or stock option award to our
five
NEOs and certain other highly compensated executives. As a result, until the Company repaid the U.S. government's TARP investment, SunTrust continued the use of salary shares in 2011 as defined in the U.S. Treasurys Interim Final Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance. Specifically, the Company paid additional base salary amounts in the form of stock (salary shares) to the SEOs and some of the other employees who were among the next 20 most highly-compensated employees. The Company did this each pay period in the form of stock units under the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (the "2009 Stock Plan"). The stock units did not include any rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. As required by EESA, each salary share was non-forfeitable upon grant and may not be sold or transferred until the expiration of a holding period (except as necessary to satisfy applicable withholding taxes). As a result, these individuals are at risk for the value of the Company's stock price until the stock unit is settled. The stock units are settled in cash; for the 2010 salary shares, one half was settled on March 31, 2011 and one half will be settled on March 31, 2012, unless settled earlier due to the executives death. The 2011 salary shares were settled on March 30, 2011, the date the Company repaid the U.S. government's TARP investment. The amount to be paid on settlement of the stock units will be equal to the value of a share of SunTrust common stock on the settlement date. Benefit plan determinations and limits were established to ensure that the salary shares were accounted for equitably within relevant benefit plans. In 2011, the value of salary shares paid was
$7 million
. As of
December 31, 2011
, the accrual related to salary shares was
$3 million
.
Following the repayment by SunTrust of the U.S. Treasurys TARP investment in the Company, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved a revised compensation structure for the Companys NEOs. Effective April 1, 2011, the compensation structure includes an annual incentive opportunity under the Companys existing MIP. A new LTI arrangement was also implemented. The design of the LTI plan delivers
50%
restricted stock units with vesting tied to the Companys total shareholder return relative to a peer group consisting of the banks which comprise the KBW Bank Sector Index. The remaining
50%
of the LTI plan will consist of approximately half restricted stock units, the vesting of which is tied to the achievement of a Tier 1 capital ratio target, and the other half in stock options. These grants are reflected in the summary of stock option and restricted stock activity table, including the aforementioned restricted stock units granted in 2011.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company provides stock-based awards through the SunTrust Banks Inc. 2009 Stock Plan (as amended and restated effective January 1, 2011) under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) has the authority to grant stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, of which some may have performance features such as vesting tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to a peer group or vesting tied to the achievement of a Tier 1 capital ratio target, to key employees of the Company. Under the 2009 Stock Plan, approximately
21 million
shares of common stock is authorized and reserved for issuance, of which no more than
17 million
shares may be issued as restricted stock or stock units. See the summary of stock option and restricted stock activity table for the shares available for additional grants. Stock options are granted at a price which is no less than the fair market value of a share of SunTrust common stock on the grant date and may be either tax-qualified incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Stock options typically vest after three years and generally have a maximum contractual life of ten years and upon option exercise, shares are issued to employees from treasury stock.
29
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Shares of restricted stock may be granted to employees and directors and typically cliff vest after three years. Restricted stock grants may be subject to one or more criteria, including employment, performance, or other conditions as established by the Committee at the time of grant. Any shares of restricted stock that are forfeited will again become available for issuance under the Stock Plan. An employee or director has the right to vote the shares of restricted stock after grant unless and until they are forfeited. Compensation cost for restricted stock is equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the award and is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. Dividends are paid on awarded but unvested restricted stock.
The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility represents the implied volatility of SunTrust stock. The expected term represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived from historical data which is used to evaluate patterns such as stock option exercise and employee termination. Through repurchase of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury in first quarter 2011, the expected dividend yield was based on the current rate in effect at grant date. Beginning in second quarter, the Company began using the projected dividend to be paid in the dividend yield assumption. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant based on the expected life of the option.
The weighted average fair values of options granted during
2011
,
2010
and
2009
were
$10.51
,
$12.78
and
$5.13
per share, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day of
2011
and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money stock options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on
December 31, 2011
. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Companys stock. Total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
was less than
$1 million
each year. Total fair value, measured as of the grant date, of restricted shares vested was
$55 million
,
$85 million
, and
$81 million
, for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
, respectively.
As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, there was
$63 million
and
$62 million
, respectively, of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock. The unrecognized stock compensation expense as of
December 31, 2011
is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
2.2
years.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in noninterest expense was as follows:
 
The recognized stock-based compensation tax benefit was
$22 million
,
$21 million
and
$30 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively.
In addition to the SunTrust stock-based compensation awards, the Company has two subsidiaries which sponsor separate equity plans where subsidiary restricted stock or restricted membership interests are granted to key employees of the subsidiaries. These awards may be subject to one or more vesting criteria, including employment, performance or other conditions as established by the board of directors or manager of the subsidiary at the time of grant. Compensation cost for these restricted awards is equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the award and is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period considering assumed forfeitures. As the equity of these subsidiaries does not trade in public markets, fair value at grant date is determined based on a current external valuation. Depending on the specific terms of the awards, unvested awards may or may not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions during the vesting period. The restricted stock awards and restricted membership interest awards are subject to certain fair value put and call provisions subsequent to vesting. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in noninterest expense for these subsidiary equity plans for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
totaled
$8 million
,
$13 million
and
$1 million
, respectively. At the end of 2010, the vesting of some of these awards caused the Company to record noncontrolling interest. In December 2011, one of the subsidiaries converted all unvested membership interest awards into LTI cash awards for a fixed dollar amount equal to the fair value of the member interest at the date of modification. The modified awards will continue to vest based on their original vesting schedule, and expense will be recognized based on the higher of the original grant value or the modified value.
Retirement Plans
Defined Contribution Plan
SunTrust maintains a qualified defined contribution plan that offers a dollar for dollar match on the first
5%
of eligible pay that a participant, including executive participants, elects to defer to the 401(k) plan. Compensation expense related to this plan for the years ended
December 31, 2011
,
2010
and
2009
totaled
$81 million
,
$74 million
and
$76 million
, respectively, excluding the
$28 million
special contribution in 2011 discussed below.
SunTrust also maintains the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan in which key executives of the Company are eligible. In accordance with the terms of the plan, the matching contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan is the same percentage of match as provided in the qualified 401(k) Plan, which is
100%
of the first
5%
of eligible pay that a participant, including an SEO, elects to defer to the plan, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the plans provisions and applicable laws and regulations. Effective January 1, 2011, employees hired on or after January 1, 2011 will become vested in the Companys 401(k) matching contributions and matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan upon completion of
two
years of vesting service. Effective January 1, 2012, the Company's 401(k) plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan were amended to increase the matching contribution from
5%
to
6%
and to permit additional discretionary Company contributions equal to a fixed percent of eligible earnings, as defined in the applicable plan. Additionally, the Company's 401(k) plan and the Deferred
32
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Compensation Plan were amended to provide for a special contribution equal to
5%
of eligible 2011 earnings for employees who have: (1) at least 20 years of service as of December 31, 2011, or (2) 10 years of service and the sum of age and service equals or exceeds 60 as of December 31, 2011. Compensation expense related to this contribution was
$28 million
.
Noncontributory Pension Plans
SunTrust maintains a funded, noncontributory qualified retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan") covering employees meeting certain service requirements. The plan provides benefits based on salary and years of service and, effective January 1, 2008, either a traditional pension benefit formula, a cash balance formula (the Personal Pension Account) or a combination of both. Participants are 100% vested after 3 years of service. The interest crediting rate applied to each Personal Pension Account was an annual effective rate of
4.42%
for
2011
. SunTrust monitors the funded status of the plan closely and due to the current funded status, SunTrust did not make a contribution for the
2011
plan year.
On October 1, 2004, SunTrust acquired NCF. Prior to the acquisition, NCF sponsored a funded qualified retirement plan, an unfunded nonqualified retirement plan for some of its participants, and certain other postretirement health benefits for its employees. Through plan amendments effective December 31, 2004 and January 1, 2008 participants' benefits under the NCF Retirement Plan were frozen with the exception of adjustments for pay increases after 2004. Similar to the SunTrust Retirement Plan, due to the current funded status of the NCF Retirement Plan, SunTrust did not make a contribution for the
2011
plan year.
SunTrust also maintains unfunded, noncontributory nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans that cover key executives of the Company (the "SERP", the "ERISA Excess Plan" and the "Restoration Plan"). The plans provide defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary. SunTrusts obligations for these nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans are included within the qualified Pension Plans in the tables presented in this section under Pension Benefits.
Effective January 1, 2008, the SERP was amended to reduce the benefit formula for future service accruals for certain existing participants and to implement a new SERP Personal Pension Account (cash balance formula) for certain other existing participants with no limit on pay for SERP Tier 2 participants and a minimum preserved benefit for SERP participants at December 31, 2007. ERISA Excess Plan participants accrue benefits under benefit formulas that mirror the revised benefit formulas in the Retirement Plan but with an earnings limit of two times the Retirement Plan's eligible earnings.
On December 31, 2010, the Company adopted the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Restoration Plan (the Restoration Plan) effective January 1, 2011. The Restoration Plan is a nonqualified defined benefit cash balance plan designed to restore benefits to certain employees that are limited under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which are not otherwise provided for under the ERISA Excess Plan. The benefit formula under the Restoration Plan is the same as the Personal Pension Account under the Retirement Plan.
Effective January 1, 2011, a separate retirement plan was created exclusively for inactive and retired employees (SunTrust Banks, Inc. Retirement Plan for Inactive Participants). Obligations and related plan assets were transferred from the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Retirement Plan to the new plan.
The Retirement Plan, the SERP, the ERISA Excess Plan, and the Restoration Plan were each amended on November 14, 2011 to cease all future benefit accruals. As a result, the traditional pension benefit formulas (final average pay formulas) will not reflect future salary increases and benefit service after December 31, 2011, and compensation credits under the Personal Pension Accounts (cash balance formula) will cease. However, interest credits under the Personal Pension Accounts will continue to accrue until benefits are distributed and service will continue to be recognized for vesting and eligibility requirements for early retirement. Additionally, the NCF Retirement Plan, which had been previously curtailed with respect to future benefit accruals, was amended to cease any adjustments for pay increases after December 31, 2011. As a result of the curtailment, the SunTrust Retirement Plan for Inactive Participants will be merged into the Retirement Plan effective January 1, 2012. The Company recorded a curtailment gain of
$88 million
which is reflected in employee benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss), and reduction to the pension benefit obligation of
$96 million
which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The curtailment gain was partially offset by the
$28 million
special 401(k) contribution noted above.
Other Postretirement Benefits
Although not under contractual obligation, SunTrust provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees (Other Postretirement Benefits in the tables below). At the option of SunTrust, retirees may continue certain health and life insurance benefits if they meet age and service requirements for Other Postretirement Benefits while working for the Company. The health care plans are contributory with participant contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plans are noncontributory. Certain retiree health benefits are funded in a Retiree Health Trust. In addition, certain retiree life insurance benefits are funded in a VEBA. SunTrust reserves the right to amend or terminate any of the benefits at any time.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Assumptions
The SunTrust Benefits Finance Committee reviews and approves the assumptions for year-end measurement calculations. A discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date. A series of benefit payments projected to be paid by the plan for the next 100 years is developed based on the most recent census data, plan provisions, and assumptions. The benefit payments at each future maturity are discounted by the year-appropriate spot interest rates. The model then solves for the discount rate that produces the same present value of the projected benefit payments as generated by discounting each years payments by the spot rate. This assumption is reviewed by the SunTrust Benefits Finance Committee and updated every year for each plan. A rate of compensation growth is used to determine future benefit obligations for those plans whose benefits vary by pay prior to recognition of the plan curtailment on November 14, 2011.
Actuarial gains and losses are created when actual experience deviates from assumptions. The actuarial losses on obligations generated within the Pension Plans in
2011
resulted primarily from lower discount rates.
The change in benefit obligations were as follows:
 
The accumulated benefit obligation for the Pension Benefits at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
was
$2.7 billion
and
$2.2 billion
, respectively.
Pension benefits with a projected benefit obligation, in excess of plan assets as of December 31, were as follows:

At year-end
2010
, all salaries were expected to increase by
3%
for
2011

4%
for
2013 and beyond

The change in plan assets were as follows:
 
Employer contributions indicated under pension benefits represent the benefits that were paid to nonqualified plan participants. SERPs are not funded through plan assets.
The fair value of plan assets is measured based on the fair value hierarchy which is discussed in Note
19
, Fair Value Election and Measurement. The valuations are based on third party data received as of the balance sheet date. Level 1 assets such as equity securities, mutual funds, and REITs are instruments that are traded in active markets and are valued based on identical instruments. Fixed income securities and common and collective trust funds are classified as level 2 assets because there is not an identical asset in the market upon which to base the valuation; however, there are no significant unobservable assumptions used to value level 2 instruments. The common and collective funds are valued each business day at its reported net asset value, as determined by the issuer, based on the underlying assets of the fund. Corporate and foreign bonds are valued based on quoted market prices obtained from external pricing sources where trading in an active market exists for level 2 assets. Level 3 assets primarily consist of private placement and noninvestment grade bonds. Limited visible market activity exists for these instruments or similar instruments and therefore significant unobservable assumptions are used to value the securities. In 2009, private placements were classified as level 3 assets; however, at the end of 2010, these were transferred to level 2 assets due to improved market conditions.

The SunTrust Benefits Finance Committee, which includes several members of senior management, establishes investment policies and strategies and formally monitors the performance of the funds on a quarterly basis. The Companys investment strategy with respect to pension assets is to invest the assets in accordance with ERISA and related fiduciary standards. The long-term primary investment objectives for the Pension Plans are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital (both principal and income) without undue exposure to risk in any single asset class or investment category and to enable the plans to provide their specific benefits to participants thereof. The objectives are accomplished utilizing a strategy of equities, fixed income, and cash equivalents in a mix that is conducive to participation in a rising market while allowing for protection in a declining market. The portfolio is viewed as long-term in its entirety, avoiding decisions based solely on short-term concerns and individual investments. The objective in the allocation of assets is diversification of investments among asset classes that are not similarly affected by economic, political, or social developments. The diversification does not necessarily depend upon the number of industries or companies in a portfolio or their particular location, but rather upon the broad nature of such investments and of the
37
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
factors that may influence them. To ensure broad diversification in the long-term investment portfolios among the major categories of investments, asset allocation, as a percent of the total market value of the total long-term portfolio, is set with the target percentages and ranges presented in the investment policy statement. Rebalancing occurs on a periodic basis to maintain the target allocation, but normal market activity may result in deviations. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, there was no SunTrust common stock held in the Pension Plans, nor were there any purchases during
2011
or
2010
.
The basis for determining the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets considers past experience, current market conditions and expectations on future trends. A building block approach is used that considers long-term inflation, real returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, market corrections (for example, narrowing of fixed income spreads between corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries) and expenses. Capital market simulations from internal and external sources, survey data, economic forecasts and actuarial judgment are all used in this process.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the SunTrust Retirement Plan for Inactive Participants was
7.75%
in 2011 and
8.00%
in
2010
. For the SunTrust Retirement Plan and the NCF Retirement Plan, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was
7.75%
through November 14, 2011 and
7.25%
for the remainder of the year in
2011
, and
8.00%
in
2010
. The expected long-term rate of return is
7.00%
for all qualified plans for
2012
. The asset allocation for the Pension Plans and the target allocation by asset category are as follows:
The investment strategy for the Other Postretirement Benefit Plans is maintained separately from the strategy for the Pension Plans. The Companys investment strategy is to create a series of investment returns sufficient to provide for current and future liabilities at a reasonable level of risk. Assets are diversified among equity and fixed income investments according to the asset mix approved by the SunTrust Benefits Finance Committee which is presented in the target allocation table below. The pre-tax expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was
6.75%
in
2011
and
2010
. The 2012 pre-tax expected long-term rate of return is
6.25%
. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, there was no common stock held in the Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, nor were there any purchases during

or

.
The asset allocation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans and the target allocation, by asset category, are as follows:

Funded Status
The funded status of the plans, as of December 31, was as follows:
1
Includes
$107 million
of benefit obligations for the unfunded nonqualified supplemental pension plans.
At
December 31, 2011
, the total outstanding unrecognized net loss to be recognized in future years for all pension and postretirement benefits was
$1.1 billion
, compared to
$0.8 billion
as of
December 31, 2010
. The key sources of the cumulative net losses are attributable to lower discount rates for the past several years and lower return on assets, predominantly in 2008. As discussed previously, SunTrust reviews its assumptions annually to ensure they represent the best estimates for the future and will, therefore, minimize future gains and losses.
As of December 31, amounts recognized in AOCI are as follows:
Expected Cash Flows
Information about the expected cash flows for the Pension Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefit plans is as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Net Periodic Cost
Components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
 
Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in OCI during
2011
are as follows:
The estimated actuarial loss that will be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is
$24 million
.
Additionally, SunTrust sets pension asset values equal to their market value, in contrast to the use of a smoothed asset value that incorporates gains and losses over a period of years. Utilization of market value of assets provides a more realistic economic measure of the plans funded status and cost. Assumed discount rates and expected returns on plan assets affect the amounts of net periodic benefit cost. A
25 basis point
decrease in the discount rate or expected long-term return on plan assets would increase all Pension and Other Postretirement Plans net periodic benefit cost approximately less than
$1 million
and
$6 million
, respectively.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the Other Postretirement Benefit plans. As of
December 31, 2011
, SunTrust assumed that pre-65 retiree health care costs will increase at an initial rate of
9.00%
 per year. SunTrust assumed a healthcare cost trend that recognizes expected inflation, technology advancements, rising cost of prescription drugs, regulatory requirements and Medicare cost shifting. SunTrust expects this annual cost increase to decrease over a
7
-year period to
5.00%
 per year. As of December 31, 2011, SunTrust assumed that post-65 retiree health costs will increase at an initial rate of
8.00%
per year. SunTrust expects this annual cost increase to decrease over a
5
-year period to
5.00%
per year.

Due to changing medical inflation, it is important to understand the effect of a one-percent point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates. These amounts are shown below:
NOTE

- DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into various derivative financial instruments, both in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions and as an end user as a risk management tool. When derivatives have been entered into with clients, the Company generally manages the risk associated with these derivatives within the framework of its VAR approach that monitors total exposure daily and seeks to manage the exposure on an overall basis. Derivatives are used as a risk management tool to hedge the Companys balance sheet exposure to changes in identified cash flow and fair value risks, either economically or in accordance with hedge accounting provisions. The Companys Corporate Treasury function is responsible for employing the various hedge accounting strategies to manage these objectives and all derivative activities are monitored by ALCO. The Company may also enter into derivatives, on a limited basis, in consideration of trading opportunities in the market. Additionally, as a normal part of its operations, the Company enters into IRLCs on mortgage loans that are accounted for as freestanding derivatives and has certain contracts containing embedded derivatives that are carried, in their entirety, at fair value. All freestanding derivatives and any embedded derivatives that the Company bifurcates from the host contracts are carried at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in trading assets, other assets, trading liabilities, or other liabilities. The associated gains and losses are either recognized in AOCI, net of tax, or within the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) depending upon the use and designation of the derivatives.
Credit and Market Risk Associated with Derivatives
Derivatives expose the Company to credit risk. The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivatives by entering into transactions with high credit-quality counterparties with defined exposure limits that are reviewed periodically by the Companys Credit Risk Management division. The Companys derivatives may also be governed by an ISDA, and depending on the nature of the derivative, bilateral collateral agreements are typically in place as well. When the Company has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty and there exists a legally enforceable master netting agreement with that counterparty, the Company considers its exposure to the counterparty to be the net market value of all positions with that counterparty, if such net value is an asset to the Company, and zero, if such net value is a liability to the Company. As of
December 31, 2011
, net derivative asset positions to which the Company was exposed to risk of its counterparties were
$2.4 billion
, representing the net of
$3.6 billion
in net derivative gains, offset by counterparty where formal netting arrangements exist, adjusted for collateral of
$1.2 billion
that the Company holds in relation to these gain positions. As of
December 31, 2010
, net derivative asset positions to which the Company was exposed to risk of its counterparties were
$1.6 billion
, representing the net of
$2.8 billion
in net derivative gains by counterparty, offset by counterparty where formal netting arrangements exist, adjusted for collateral of
$1.2 billion
that the Company holds in relation to these gain positions.
Derivatives also expose the Company to market risk. Market risk is the adverse effect that a change in market factors, such as interest rates, currency rates, equity prices, or implied volatility, has on the value of a derivative. The Company manages the market risk associated with its derivatives by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. The Company continually measures this risk associated with its derivatives designated as trading instruments using a VAR methodology.
Derivative instruments are primarily transacted in the institutional dealer market and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to its derivative positions, the Company has evaluated liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of its counterparties and its own credit. The Company has considered factors such as the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties, its net exposures, and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate fair value adjustments to recognize. Generally, the expected loss of each counterparty is estimated using the Companys proprietary internal risk rating system. The risk rating system utilizes counterparty-specific probabilities of default and LGD estimates to derive the expected loss. For counterparties that are rated by national rating agencies, those ratings are also considered in estimating the credit risk. Additionally, counterparty exposure is evaluated by offsetting positions that are subject to master netting arrangements, as well as considering the amount of marketable collateral securing the position. All counterparties are explicitly approved, as are defined exposure limits. Counterparties are regularly reviewed and appropriate business action is taken to adjust the exposure to certain counterparties, as necessary. This approach is also used by the Company to estimate its own credit risk on derivative liability positions. The Company adjusted the net fair value of its derivative contracts for estimates of net counterparty credit risk by approximately
$36 million
and
$33 million
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
41
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The majority of the Companys derivatives contain contingencies that relate to the creditworthiness of the Bank. These contingencies, which are contained in industry standard master trading agreements, may be considered events of default. Should the Bank be in default under any of these provisions, the Banks counterparties would be permitted under such master agreements to close-out net at amounts that would approximate the then-fair values of the derivatives and the offsetting of the amounts would produce a single sum due by one party to the other. The counterparties would have the right to apply any collateral posted by the Bank against any net amount owed by the Bank. Additionally, certain of the Companys derivative liability positions, totaling
$1.2 billion
and
$1.1 billion
in fair value at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, contain provisions conditioned on downgrades of the Banks credit rating. These provisions, if triggered, would either give rise to an ATE that permits the counterparties to close-out net and apply collateral or, where a CSA is present, require the Bank to post additional collateral. Collateral posting requirements generally result from differences in the fair value of the net derivative liability compared to specified collateral thresholds at different ratings levels of the Bank, both of which are negotiated provisions within each CSA. At
December 31, 2011
, the Bank carried senior long-term debt ratings of A3/BBB+ from three of the major ratings agencies. At the current rating level, ATEs have been triggered for approximately
$9 million
in fair value liabilities as of
December 31, 2011
. For illustrative purposes, if the Bank were downgraded to Baa3/BBB-, ATEs would be triggered in derivative liability contracts that had a total fair value of
$5 million
at
December 31, 2011
, against which the Bank had posted collateral of
$3 million
; ATEs do not exist at lower ratings levels. At
December 31, 2011
,
$1.2 billion
in fair value of derivative liabilities were subject to CSAs, against which the Bank has posted
$1.2 billion
in collateral, primarily in the form of cash. If requested by the counterparty pursuant to the terms of the CSA, the Bank would be required to post estimated additional collateral against these contracts at
December 31, 2011
of
$16 million
if the Bank were downgraded to Baa3/BBB-, and any further downgrades to Ba1/BB+ or below would require the posting of an additional
$10 million
. Such collateral posting amounts may be more or less than the Banks estimates based on the specified terms of each CSA as to the timing of a collateral calculation and whether the Bank and its counterparties differ on their estimates of the fair values of the derivatives or collateral.
Notional and Fair Value of Derivative Positions
The following tables present the Companys derivative positions at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. The notional amounts in the tables are presented on a gross basis and have been classified within Asset Derivatives or Liability Derivatives based on the estimated fair value of the individual contract at
December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Gross positive and gross negative fair value amounts associated with respective notional amounts are presented without consideration of any netting agreements. For contracts constituting a combination of options that contain a written option and a purchased option (such as a collar), the notional amount of each option is presented separately, with the purchased notional amount generally being presented as an Asset Derivative and the written notional amount being presented as a Liability Derivative. The fair value of a combination of options is generally presented as a single value with the purchased notional amount if the combined fair value is positive, and with the written notional amount, if the combined fair value is negative.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Credit Derivatives
As part of its trading businesses, the Company enters into contracts that are, in form or substance, written guarantees: specifically, CDS, swap participations, and TRS. The Company accounts for these contracts as derivatives and, accordingly, recognizes these contracts at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in trading income/(loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
The Company writes CDS, which are agreements under which the Company receives premium payments from its counterparty for protection against an event of default of a reference asset. In the event of default under the CDS, the Company would either net cash settle or make a cash payment to its counterparty and take delivery of the defaulted reference asset, from which the Company may recover all, a portion, or none of the credit loss, depending on the performance of the reference asset. Events of default, as defined in the CDS agreements, are generally triggered upon the failure to pay and similar events related to the issuer(s) of the reference asset. As of
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, all written CDS contracts reference single name corporate credits or corporate credit indices. When the Company has written CDS, it has generally entered into offsetting CDS for the underlying reference asset, under which the Company paid a premium to its counterparty for protection against an event of default on the reference asset. The counterparties to these purchased CDS are generally of high creditworthiness and typically have ISDA master agreements in place that subject the CDS to master netting provisions, thereby mitigating the risk of non-payment to the Company. As such, at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Company did not have any significant risk of making a non-recoverable payment on any written CDS. During
2011
and
2010
, the only instances of default on written CDS were driven by credit indices with constituent credit default. In all cases where the Company made resulting cash payments to settle, the Company collected like amounts from the counterparties to the offsetting purchased CDS. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the written CDS had remaining terms ranging from one year to nine years and two months to five years, respectively. The maximum guarantees outstanding at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, as measured by the gross notional amounts of written CDS, were
$167 million
and
$99 million
, respectively. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the gross notional amounts of purchased CDS contracts, which represent benefits to, rather than obligations of, the Company, were
$175 million
and
$87 million
, respectively. The fair values of written CDS were
$4 million
and
$3 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
and the fair values of purchased CDS were
$6 million
and less than
$1 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
.
The Company writes risk participations, which are credit derivatives, whereby the Company has guaranteed payment to a dealer counterparty in the event that the counterparty experiences a loss on a derivative, such as an interest rate swap, due to a failure to pay by the counterpartys customer (the obligor) on that derivative. The Company monitors its payment risk on its risk participations by monitoring the creditworthiness of the obligors, which is based on the normal credit review process the Company would have performed had it entered into the derivatives directly with the obligors. The obligors are all corporations or partnerships. However, the Company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its obligors and the likelihood of payment could change at
47
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
any time due to unforeseen circumstances. To date, no material losses have been incurred related to the Companys written risk participations. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the remaining terms on these risk participations generally ranged from one month to seven years and one month to eight years, respectively, with a weighted average on the maximum estimated exposure of
3.5
years and
3.1
years, respectively. The Companys maximum estimated exposure to written risk participations, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments based on interest rate curve simulations and assuming
100%
default by all obligors on the maximum values, was approximately
$57 million
and
$74 million
at
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, respectively. The fair values of the written risk participations were not material at both
December 31, 2011
and
2010
. As part of its trading activities, the Company may enter into purchased risk participations, but such activity is not matched, as discussed herein related to CDS or TRS.
The Company has also entered into TRS contracts on loans. The Companys TRS business consists of matched trades, such that when the Company pays depreciation on one TRS, it receives the same amount on the matched TRS. As such, the Company does not have any long or short exposure, other than credit risk of its counterparty which is mitigated through collateralization. The Company typically receives initial cash collateral from the counterparty upon entering into the TRS and is entitled to additional collateral if the fair value of the underlying reference assets deteriorate. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, there were
$1.6 billion
and
$969 million
of outstanding and offsetting TRS notional balances, respectively. The fair values of the TRS derivative assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2011
were
$20 million
and
$17 million
, respectively, and related collateral held at
December 31, 2011
was
$285 million
. The fair values of the TRS derivative assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2010
were
$34 million
and
$32 million
, respectively, and related collateral held at
December 31, 2010
was
$268 million
.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company utilizes a comprehensive risk management strategy to monitor sensitivity of earnings to movements in interest rates. Specific types of funding and principal amounts hedged are determined based on prevailing market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. In conjunction with this strategy, the Company may employ various interest rate derivatives as risk management tools to hedge interest rate risk from recognized assets and liabilities or from forecasted transactions. The terms and notional amounts of derivatives are determined based on managements assessment of future interest rates, as well as other factors. At
December 31, 2011
, the Companys outstanding interest rate hedging relationships include interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges of probable forecasted transactions related to recognized floating rate loans.
Interest rate swaps have been designated as hedging the exposure to the benchmark interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans. At
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the maximum range of hedge maturities for hedges of floating rate loans was one to six years, with the weighted average being
3.4
years and
3.5
years, respectively. Ineffectiveness on these hedges was not material during the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
. As of
December 31, 2011
,
$304 million
, net of tax, of the deferred net gains on derivatives that are recognized in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to net interest income over the next twelve months in connection with the recognition of interest income on these hedged items.
During the third quarter of 2008, the Company executed The Agreements on
30 million
common shares of Coke. A consolidated subsidiary of SunTrust owns
22.9 million
Coke common shares and a consolidated subsidiary of the Bank owns
7.1 million
Coke common shares. These two subsidiaries entered into separate derivative contracts on their respective holdings of Coke common shares with a large, unaffiliated financial institution (the Counterparty). Execution of The Agreements (including the pledges of the Coke common shares pursuant to the terms of The Agreements) did not constitute a sale of the Coke common shares under U.S. GAAP for several reasons, including that ownership of the common shares was not legally transferred to the Counterparty. The Agreements were zero-cost equity collars at inception, which caused the Agreements to be derivatives in their entirety. The Company has designated The Agreements as cash flow hedges of the Companys probable forecasted sales of its Coke common shares, which are expected to occur between
6.5
years and
7
years from The Agreements effective date, for overall price volatility below the strike prices on the floor (purchased put) and above the strike prices on the ceiling (written call). Although the Company is not required to deliver its Coke common shares under The Agreements, the Company has asserted that it is probable that it will sell all of its Coke common shares at or around the settlement date of The Agreements. The Federal Reserves approval for Tier 1 capital treatment was significantly based on this expected disposition of the Coke common shares under The Agreements or in another market transaction. Both the sale and the timing of such sale remain probable to occur as designated. At least quarterly, the Company assesses hedge effectiveness and measures hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the changes in fair value of The Agreements recognized in AOCI and any ineffective portions recognized in trading income/(loss). None of the components of The Agreements fair values are excluded from the Companys assessments of hedge effectiveness. Potential sources of ineffectiveness include changes in market dividends and certain early termination provisions. The Company recognized ineffectiveness gains of
$2 million
during both
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
. Ineffectiveness gains were recognized in trading income/(loss). Other than potential measured hedge ineffectiveness, no amounts are expected to be reclassified from AOCI over the next twelve months and any remaining amounts recognized in AOCI will be reclassified to earnings when the probable forecasted sales of the Coke common shares occur.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Fair Value Hedges
During 2011, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements, as part of the Companys risk management objectives for hedging its exposure to changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates. These hedging arrangements include converting Company issued fixed rate senior long-term debt and fixed rate U.S. Treasury securities AFS to floating rates. Consistent with this objective, the Company reflects the accrued contractual interest on the hedged item and the related swaps as part of current period interest. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded in the Companys assessment of hedge effectiveness related to the fair value hedges.
Economic Hedging and Trading Activities
In addition to designated hedging relationships, the Company also enters into derivatives as an end user as a risk management tool to economically hedge risks associated with certain non-derivative and derivative instruments, along with entering into derivatives in a trading capacity with its clients.
The primary risks that the Company economically hedges are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and credit risk. Economic hedging objectives are accomplished by entering into offsetting derivatives either on an individual basis, or collectively on a macro basis, and generally accomplish the Companys goal of mitigating the targeted risk. To the extent that specific derivatives are associated with specific hedged items, the notional amounts, fair values, and gains/(losses) on the derivatives are illustrated in the tables in this footnote.

 REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS AND GUARANTEES
Reinsurance
The Company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies. Under these contracts, the Company provides aggregate excess loss coverage in a mezzanine layer in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premium. As of
December 31, 2011
, approximately
$8.0 billion
of mortgage loans were covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts. The reinsurance contracts are intended to place limits on the Companys maximum exposure to losses by defining the loss amounts ceded to the Company as well as by establishing trust accounts for each contract. The trust accounts, which are comprised of funds contributed by the Company plus premiums earned under the reinsurance contracts, are maintained to fund claims made under the reinsurance contracts. If claims exceed funds held in the trust accounts, the Company does not intend to make additional contributions beyond future premiums earned under the existing contracts.
At
December 31, 2011
, the total loss exposure ceded to the Company was approximately
$309 million
; however, the maximum amount of loss exposure based on funds held in each separate trust account, including net premiums due to the trust accounts, was limited to
$42 million
. Of this amount,
$38 million
of losses have been reserved for as of
December 31, 2011
, reducing the Companys net remaining loss exposure to
$4 million
. The reinsurance reserve was $
148 million
as of
December 31, 2010
. The decrease in the reserve balance was due to claim payments made to the primary mortgage insurance companies since
December 31, 2010
, as well as the relinquishment of one trust during the second quarter of
2011
. The Companys evaluation of the required reserve amount includes an estimate of claims to be paid by the trust in relation to loans in default and an assessment of the sufficiency of future revenues, including premiums and investment income on funds held in the trusts, to cover future claims. Future reported losses may exceed
$4 million
, since future premium income will increase the amount of funds held in the trust; however, future cash losses, net of premium income, are not expected to exceed
$4 million
. The amount of future premium income is limited to the population of loans currently outstanding since additional loans are not being added to the reinsurance contracts; future premium income could be further curtailed to the extent the Company agrees to relinquish control of other individual trusts to the mortgage insurance companies. Premium income, which totaled
$26 million
,
$38 million
, and
$48 million
for each of the years ended
December 31, 2011
, 2010, and 2009, respectively, is reported as part of noninterest income. The related provision for losses, which totaled
$28 million
,
$27 million
, and
$115 million
for each of the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively, is reported as part of other noninterest expense.
Guarantees
The Company has undertaken certain guarantee obligations in the ordinary course of business. The issuance of a guarantee imposes an obligation for the Company to stand ready to perform and should certain triggering events occur, it also imposes an obligation to make future payments. Payments may be in the form of cash, financial instruments, other assets, shares of stock, or provisions of the Companys services. The following is a discussion of the guarantees that the Company has issued as of
December 31, 2011
. The Company has also entered into certain contracts that are similar to guarantees, but that are accounted for as derivatives (see Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments).
Letters of Credit
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company generally to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party in borrowing arrangements, such as CP, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to clients and may be reduced by selling participations to third parties. The Company issues letters of credit that are classified as financial standby, performance standby, or commercial letters of credit.
As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the maximum potential amount of the Companys obligation was
$5.2 billion
and
$6.4 billion
, respectively, for financial and performance standby letters of credit. The Company has recorded
$105 million
and
$109 million
in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for unearned fees related to these letters of credit as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The Companys outstanding letters of credit generally have a term of less than one year but may extend longer. If a letter of credit is drawn upon, the Company may seek recourse through the clients underlying obligation. If the clients line of credit is also in default, the Company may take possession of the collateral securing the line of credit, where applicable. The Company monitors its credit exposure under standby letters of credit in the same manner as it monitors other extensions of credit in accordance with credit policies. Some standby letters of credit are designed to be drawn upon and others are drawn upon only under circumstances of dispute or default in the underlying transaction to which the Company is not a party. In all cases, the Company holds the right to reimbursement from the applicant and may or may not also hold collateral to secure that right. An internal assessment of the PD and loss severity in the event of default is assessed consistent with the methodologies used for all commercial borrowers. The management of credit risk regarding letters of credit leverages the risk rating process to focus higher visibility on the higher risk and higher dollar letters of credit. The associated reserve is a component of the unfunded commitment reserve recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in the allowance for credit losses as disclosed in Note
7
, Allowance for Credit Losses.
Loan Sales
STM, a consolidated subsidiary of SunTrust, originates and purchases residential mortgage loans, a portion of which are sold to outside investors in the normal course of business, through a combination of whole loan sales to GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and non-agency investors. Prior to 2008, the Company also sold loans through a limited amount of Company sponsored securitizations. When mortgage loans are sold, representations and warranties regarding certain attributes of the loans sold are made to these third party purchasers. Subsequent to the sale, if a material underwriting deficiency or documentation defect is discovered, STM may be obligated to repurchase the mortgage loan or to reimburse the investor for losses incurred (make whole requests) if such deficiency or defect cannot be cured by STM within the specified period following discovery. Defects in the securitization process or breaches of underwriting and servicing representations and warranties can result in loan repurchases, as well as adversely affect the valuation of MSRs, servicing advances or other mortgage loan related exposures, such as OREO. These representations and warranties may extend through the life of the mortgage loan. STMs risk of loss under its representations and warranties is largely driven by borrower payment performance since investors will perform extensive reviews of delinquent loans as a means of mitigating losses.
Loan repurchase requests generally arise from loans sold during the period from January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2011
, which totaled
$244.3 billion
at the time of sale, consisting of
$187.4 billion
and
$30.3 billion
of agency and non-agency loans, respectively, as well as
$26.6 billion
of loans sold to Ginnie Mae. The composition of the remaining outstanding balance by vintage and type of buyer as of
December 31, 2011
is shown in the following table:
 
1
Balances based on loans serviced by the Company.
Non-agency loan sales include whole loans and loans sold in private securitization transactions. While representations and warranties have been made related to these sales, they differ in many cases from those made in connection with loans sold to the GSEs in that non-agency loans may not be required to meet the same underwriting standards and, in addition to identifying a representation or warranty breach, non-agency investors are generally required to demonstrate that the breach was material and directly related to the cause of default. Loans sold to Ginnie Mae are insured by either the FHA or VA. As servicer, we may elect to repurchase delinquent loans in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines; however, the loans continue to be insured. Although we indemnify the FHA and VA for losses related to loans not originated in accordance with their guidelines, such occurrences are limited and no repurchase liability has been recorded for loans sold to Ginnie Mae.
Although the timing and volume has varied, repurchase and make whole requests have increased over the past several years and more recently during the latter half of 2011. Repurchase requests from GSEs and non-agency investors were
$1.7 billion
,
$1.1 billion
, and
$1.1 billion
during the years ended 2011,
2010
, and
2009
, respectively, and on a cumulative basis since 2005 has been
$5.3 billion
, which includes Ginnie Mae repurchase requests. The majority of these requests are from GSEs, with a limited number of requests having been received related to non-agency investors. Repurchase requests from non-agency investors were
$50 million
,
$55 million
, and
$99 million
during the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively. Additionally, repurchase requests related to loans originated in 2006 and 2007 have consistently comprised the vast majority of total repurchase requests during the past three years. The repurchase and make whole requests received have been primarily due to material breaches of representations related to compliance with the applicable underwriting standards, including borrower misrepresentation and appraisal issues. STM performs a loan by loan review of all requests, and demands have been contested to the extent they are not considered valid. At
December 31, 2011
, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved requests previously received from investors was
$590 million
, comprised of
$578 million
from the GSEs and
$12 million
from non-agency investors. Comparable amounts at
December 31, 2010
, were
$293 million
, comprised of
$264 million
from the GSEs and
$29 million
from non-agency investors.
The Company uses the best information available when estimating its mortgage repurchase liability. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company's estimate of the liability for incurred losses related to all vintages of mortgage loans sold totaled
$320 million
and
$265 million
, respectively. The liability is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related repurchase provision is recognized in mortgage production related (loss)/income in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
A significant degree of judgment is used to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability. This estimation process is inherently uncertain and subject to imprecision; consequently, there is a range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the recorded repurchase liability. Based on an analysis of the assumptions used to estimate the repurchase liability related to loans sold prior to 2009, the Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that the estimated liability, as of December 31, 2011, could exceed the current repurchase liability by
$0
to
$700 million
. This estimate is subject to revision due to changes in borrower default levels, investor request criteria and behavior, repurchase rates, and home values. This estimate of reasonably possible incremental loss does not pertain to non-agency investors or to loans sold after 2008 due to the limited amount of historical repurchase request and loss experience the Company has realized on these more recent vintages; therefore, the Company is unable to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for loans sold to non-agency investors or for loans sold subsequent to 2008. The following table summarizes the changes in the Companys reserve for mortgage loan repurchases:
 
During the years ended
December 31, 2011
and
2010
, the Company repurchased or otherwise settled mortgages with unpaid principal balances of
$789 million
and
$677 million
, respectively, related to investor demands. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the carrying value of outstanding repurchased mortgage loans, net of any allowance for loan losses, totaled
$252 million
and
$153 million
, respectively, of which
$134 million
and
$86 million
, respectively, were nonperforming.
As of
December 31, 2011
, the Company maintained a reserve for costs associated with foreclosure delays of loans serviced for GSEs. The Company normally retains servicing rights when loans are transferred. As servicer, the Company makes representations and warranties that it will service the loans in accordance with investor servicing guidelines and standards which include collection and remittance of principal and interest, administration of escrow for taxes and insurance, advancing principal, interest, taxes, insurance and collection expenses on delinquent accounts, loss mitigation strategies including loan modifications, and foreclosures. STM recognizes a liability for contingent losses when MSRs are sold, which totaled
$8 million
and
$6 million
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively.
Contingent Consideration
The Company has contingent payment obligations related to certain business combination transactions. Payments are calculated using certain post-acquisition performance criteria. Arrangements entered into prior to January 1, 2009 are not recorded as liabilities until the contingency is resolved; whereas, arrangements entered into subsequent to that date are recorded as liabilities at the fair value of the contingent payment. The potential obligation associated with these arrangements was
$10 million
and
$5 million
as of
December 31, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
, respectively, of which
$10 million
and
$3 million
were recorded as a liability representing the fair value of the contingent payments as of
December 31, 2011
and
December 31, 2010
, respectively. If required, these contingent payments will be payable over the next three years.
Visa
The Company issues and acquires credit and debit card transactions through Visa. The Company is a defendant, along with Visa and MasterCard International (the Card Associations), as well as several other banks, in one of several antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of the Card Associations (the Litigation). The Company has entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks in order to apportion financial responsibilities arising from any potential adverse judgment or negotiated settlements related to the Litigation. Additionally, in connection with Visas restructuring in 2007, a provision of the original Visa By-Laws, Section 2.05j, was restated in Visas certificate of incorporation. Section 2.05j contains a general indemnification provision between a Visa member and Visa, and explicitly provides that after the closing of the restructuring, each members indemnification obligation is limited to losses arising from its own conduct and the specifically defined Litigation. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under this indemnification provision cannot be determined as there is no limitation provided under the By-Laws and the amount of exposure is dependent on the outcome of the Litigation. As of
December 31, 2011
, Visa had funded
$8.1 billion
into an escrow account, established for the purpose of funding judgments in, or settlements of, the Litigation. Agreements associated with Visas IPO have provisions that Visa will first use the funds in the escrow account to pay for future settlements of, or judgments in the Litigation. If the escrow account is insufficient to cover the Litigation losses, then Visa will issue additional Class A shares (loss shares). The proceeds from the sale of the loss shares would then be deposited in the escrow account. The issuance of the loss shares will cause a dilution of Visas Class B shares as a result of an adjustment to lower the conversion factor of the Class B shares to Class A shares. Visa U.S.A.s members are responsible for any portion of the settlement or loss on the Litigation after the escrow account is depleted and the value of the Class B shares is fully-diluted. In May 2009, the Company sold its
3.2 million
Visa Inc. Class B shares to another financial institution (the Counterparty) and entered into a derivative with the Counterparty. The Company received
$112 million
and recognized a gain of
$112 million
in connection with these transactions. Under the derivative, the Counterparty will be compensated by the Company for any decline in the conversion factor as a result of the outcome of the Litigation. Conversely, the Company will be compensated by the Counterparty for any increase in the conversion factor. The amount of compensation is a function of the
3.2 million
shares sold to the Counterparty, the change in conversion rate, and Visas share price. The Counterparty, as a result of its ownership of the Class B shares, will be impacted by dilutive adjustments to the conversion factor of the Class B shares caused by the Litigation losses. The conversion factor at the inception of the derivative in May 2009 was
0.6296
and as of
December 31, 2011
the conversion factor had decreased to
0.4254
due to Visas funding of the litigation escrow account. The decreases in the conversion factor triggered payments by the Company to the Counterparty of
$8 million
,
$17 million
, and
$10 million
during
2011
,
2010
, and
2009
, respectively. A high degree of subjectivity was used in estimating the fair value of the derivative liability, and the ultimate impact to the Company could be significantly higher or lower than the
$22 million
and
$23 million
recorded as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. See Note
20
, "Contingencies," for additional discussion of the related litigation.
Public Deposits
The Company holds public deposits from various states in which it does business. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance and may also require a cross-guarantee among all banks holding public deposits of the individual state. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions. Certain of the states in which the Company holds public deposits use a pooled collateral method, whereby in the event of default of a bank holding public deposits, the collateral of the defaulting bank is liquidated to the extent necessary to recover the loss of public deposits of the defaulting bank. To the extent the collateral is insufficient, the remaining public deposit balances of the defaulting bank are recovered through an assessment, from the other banks holding public deposits in that state. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is dependent on a variety of factors, including the amount of public funds held by banks in the states in which the Company also holds public deposits and the amount of collateral coverage associated with any defaulting bank. Individual states appear to be monitoring this risk relative to the current economic environment and evaluating collateral requirements; therefore, the likelihood that the Company would have to perform under this guarantee is dependent on whether any banks holding public funds default as well as the adequacy of collateral coverage.
Other
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into indemnification agreements and provides standard representations and warranties in connection with numerous transactions. These transactions include those arising from securitization activities, underwriting agreements, merger and acquisition agreements, loan sales, contractual commitments, payment processing, sponsorship agreements, and various other business transactions or arrangements. The extent of the Companys obligations under these indemnification agreements depends upon the occurrence of future events; therefore, the Companys potential future liability under these arrangements is not determinable.
STIS and STRH, broker-dealer affiliates of SunTrust, use a common third-party clearing broker to clear and execute their customers securities transactions and to hold customer accounts. Under their respective agreements, STIS and STRH agree to indemnify the clearing broker for losses that result from a customers failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. As the clearing brokers rights to charge STIS and STRH have no maximum amount, the Company believes that the maximum potential obligation cannot be estimated. However, to mitigate exposure, the affiliate may seek recourse from the customer through cash or securities held in the defaulting customers account. For the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, STIS and STRH experienced minimal net losses as a result of the indemnity. The clearing agreements expire in May 2015 for both STIS and STRH.
SunTrust Community Capital, a SunTrust subsidiary, previously obtained state and federal tax credits through the construction and development of affordable housing properties and continues to obtain state and federal tax credits through investments in affordable housing developments. SunTrust Community Capital or its subsidiaries are limited and/or general partners in various partnerships established for the properties. Some of the investments that generate state tax credits may be sold to outside investors. As of
December 31, 2011
, SunTrust Community Capital has completed
six
sales containing guarantee provisions stating that SunTrust Community Capital will make payment to the outside investors if the tax credits become ineligible. SunTrust Community Capital also guarantees that the general partner under the transaction will perform on the delivery of the credits. The guarantees are expected to expire within a
ten
year period from inception. As of
December 31, 2011
, the maximum potential amount that SunTrust Community Capital could be obligated to pay under these guarantees is
$37 million
; however, SunTrust Community Capital can seek recourse against the general partner. Additionally, SunTrust Community Capital can seek reimbursement from cash flow and residual values of the underlying affordable housing properties provided that the properties retain value. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
$5 million
and
$7 million
, respectively, was accrued representing the remainder of tax credits to be delivered, and were recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
NOTE

- FAIR VALUE ELECTION AND MEASUREMENT
The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis and appropriately classifies them as level 1, 2, or 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The Companys recurring fair value measurements are based on a requirement to carry such assets and liabilities at fair value or the Companys election to carry certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis include trading securities, securities AFS, and derivative financial instruments. Assets and liabilities that the Company has elected to carry at fair value on a recurring basis include certain LHFI and LHFS, MSRs, certain brokered deposits, and certain issuances of fixed rate debt.
In certain circumstances, fair value enables a company to more accurately align its financial performance with the economic value of actively traded or hedged assets or liabilities. Fair value also enables a company to mitigate the non-economic earnings volatility caused from financial assets and financial liabilities being carried at different bases of accounting, as well as to more accurately portray the active and dynamic management of a companys balance sheet.
The classification of an instrument as level 3 versus 2 involves judgment and is based on a variety of subjective factors in order to assess whether a market is inactive, resulting in the application of significant unobservable assumptions to value a financial instrument. A market is considered inactive if significant decreases in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have been observed. In determining whether a market is inactive, the Company evaluates such factors as the number of recent transactions in either the primary or secondary markets, whether price quotations are current, the nature of the market participants, the variability of price quotations, the significance of bid/ask spreads, declines in (or the absence of) new issuances and the availability of public information. Inactive markets necessitate the use of additional judgment when valuing financial instruments, such as pricing matrices, cash flow modeling, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The assumptions used to estimate the value of an instrument where the market was inactive are based on the Companys assessment of the assumptions a market participant would use to value the instrument in an orderly transaction and include considerations of illiquidity in the current market environment.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present certain information regarding assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the changes in fair value for those specific financial instruments in which fair value has been elected.

The following is a discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used in developing fair value measurements for assets and liabilities classified as level 2 or 3 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based on the class as determined by the nature and risks of the instrument.
Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale
Unless otherwise indicated, trading assets are priced by the trading desk and independently validated against pricing received from two or three third party pricing sources; securities AFS are valued by an independent third party pricing service and independently validated against pricing received from two other third party pricing sources, all of which are sources that are widely used by market participants. The Company classifies instruments as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy when it is able to determine that external pricing sources are using similar instruments trading in the markets as the basis for estimating fair value. One way the Company determines this is by the number of pricing services that will provide a quote on the instrument along with the range of values provided by those pricing services. A wide range of quoted values may indicate that significant adjustments to the trades in the market are being made by the pricing services.
Federal agency securities
The Company includes in this classification securities issued by federal agencies and GSEs. Agency securities consist of debt obligations issued by HUD, FHLB and other agencies, or collateralized by loans that are guaranteed by the SBA and are, therefore, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. In the case of securities issued by GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government; however, the GSEs carry an implied rating commensurate with that of U.S. government obligations and may be required to maintain such rating through its agency agreement. In certain instances, the U.S. Treasury owns the senior preferred stock of these enterprises and has made a commitment, under that stock purchase agreement, to provide these GSEs with funds to maintain a positive net worth. For SBA instruments, the Company estimated fair value based on pricing from observable trading activity for similar securities or obtained fair values from a third party pricing service; accordingly, the Company has classified these instruments as level 2.
U.S. states and political subdivisions
The Companys investments in U.S. states and political subdivisions (collectively municipals) include obligations of county and municipal authorities and agency bonds, which are general obligations of the municipality or are supported by a specified revenue source. Holdings were geographically dispersed, with no significant concentrations in any one state or municipality. Additionally, all but an immaterial amount of AFS municipal obligations classified as level 2 are highly rated or are otherwise collateralized by securities backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Level 3 municipal securities includes ARS purchased since the auction rate market began failing in February 2008 and have been considered level 3 securities due to the significant decrease in the volume and level of activity in these markets, which has necessitated the use of significant unobservable inputs into the Companys valuations. Municipal ARS are classified as securities AFS. These securities were valued using comparisons to similar ARS for which auctions are currently successful and/or to longer term, non-ARS issued by similar municipalities. The Company also evaluated the relative strength of the municipality and made appropriate downward adjustments in price based on the credit rating of the municipality as well as the relative financial strength of the insurer on those bonds. Although auctions for several municipal ARS have been operating successfully, ARS owned by the Company at
December 31, 2011
continued to be classified as level 3 as they are those ARS for which the auctions continued to fail; accordingly, due to the uncertainty around the success rates for auctions and the absence of any successful auctions for these identical securities, the Company continued to price the ARS below par.
Level 3 AFS municipal bond securities also include bonds that are only redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market. As such, no significant observable market data for these instruments is available. In order to estimate pricing on these securities, the Company utilized a third party municipal bond yield curve for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB rated) and priced each bond based on the yield associated with that maturity.
MBS  agency
MBS  agency includes pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by GSEs and U.S. government agencies, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Each security contains a guarantee by the issuing GSE or agency. For agency MBS, the Company estimated fair value based on pricing from observable trading activity for similar securities or obtained fair values from a third party pricing service; accordingly, the Company has classified these as level 2.
MBS  private
Private MBS includes purchased interests in third party securitizations as well as retained interests in Company-sponsored securitizations of residential mortgages. In 2010, the Company also had approximately $9 million of private label CMBS in trading assets that were received as part of a SIV liquidation (see CDO/CLO discussion below). Generally, the Company attempts to obtain pricing for its securities from an independent pricing service or third party brokers who have experience in valuing certain investments. This pricing may be used as either direct support for the Companys valuations or used to validate outputs from its own proprietary models. The Company evaluates third party pricing to determine the reasonableness of the information relative to changes in market data, such as any recent trades, market information received from outside market participants and analysts, and/or changes in the underlying collateral performance. For a de minimis amount of private MBS, the Company uses industry-standard or proprietary models to estimate fair value and considers assumptions that are generally not observable in the current markets or that are not specific to the securities that the Company owns, such as relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates. As liquidity returns to these markets, the Company has seen more pricing information from third parties and a reduction in the need to use pricing models to estimate fair value. Even though limited third party pricing has been available, the Company continued to classify private MBS as level 3, as the Company believes that this third party pricing relied on significant unobservable assumptions, as evidenced by a persistently wide bid-ask price range and variability in pricing from the pricing services, particularly for the vintage and exposures held by the Company.
For the private CMBS held at December 31, 2010, the Company was able to obtain pricing information as part of the foreclosure sale at liquidation and was also able to obtain at least two different pricing sources that were within narrow price range. As such, the Company classified these securities as level 2. Certain vintages of private RMBS have suffered from deterioration in credit quality leading to downgrades. At December 31, 2011, the Company's private RMBS contained 2006 to 2007 vintage securities AFS and trading securities. At December 31, 2010, private RMBS also included 2003 vintage securities classified as AFS. All but a de minimis amount of the 2006 and 2007 vintage securities AFS and trading securities had been downgraded to non-investment grade levels by at least one nationally recognized rating agency. The vast majority of these securities had high investment grade ratings at the time of origination or purchase. The 2006 to 2007 vintage collateral is predominantly comprised of prime jumbo fixed and floating rate loans. The 2003 vintage securities are interests retained from a securitization of prime first lien fixed and floating rate loans and are primarily all investment grade rated, with the exception of a small amount of support bonds. The majority of these securities had maintained their original ratings, with a small amount of upgrades and only one bond downgraded since inception of the deal. During 2011, the Company's remaining interests of
$49 million
in the 2003 securitization were liquidated through the exercise of the Company's clean up call rights on the underlying collateral. See Note
11
, "Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities."

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Securities that are classified as AFS and are in an unrealized loss position are included as part of our quarterly OTTI evaluation process. See Note
5
, Securities Available for Sale, for details regarding assumptions used to assess impairment and impairment amounts recognized through earnings on private MBS during the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
.
CDO/CLO Securities
Level 2 securities AFS consists of a senior interest in a third party CLOs for which independent broker pricing based on market trades and/or from new issuance of similar assets is readily available. At
December 31, 2011
, the Companys investments in level 3 trading CDOs consisted of senior ARS interests in Company-sponsored securitizations of trust preferred collateral. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company sold the remaining securities within trading assets that were received upon the liquidation of one of the Companys SIV investments, which included
$21 million
of CDO securities. Additionally, the Companys
$20 million
retained interest in a structured participation of commercial loans was liquidated in 2011 through the exercise of the Companys clean up call. For the ARS CDOs classified as level 3 trading assets, the increase in the value of these interests during the
year ended December 31, 2011
was due to a steady recovery in the broader CDO market during the first half of the year along with an improvement in the underlying collateral for most of the individual interests. Additionally, the Company purchased CDO ARS securities in July 2011 as a result of the settlement of an ARS claim. For additional information, see Note
11
, "Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities," and Note
20
, "Contingencies." Although market conditions have improved, the auctions continue to fail and the Company continues to make significant adjustments to valuation assumptions available from observable secondary market trading of similar term securities; therefore, the Company continued to classify these as level 3 investments.
Asset-backed securities
Level 2 ABS classified as securities AFS are primarily interests collateralized by third party securitizations of 2009 through 2011 vintage auto loans. These ABS are either publicly traded or are 144A privately placed bonds. The Company utilizes an independent pricing service to obtain fair values for publicly traded securities and similar securities for estimating the fair value of the privately placed bonds. No significant unobservable assumptions were used in pricing the auto loan ABS; therefore, the Company classified these bonds as level 2. Additionally, the Company classified
$32 million
of trading ARS and
$72 million
of AFS ARS collateralized by government guaranteed student loans as level 2 due to observable market trades and bids for similar senior securities. Student loan ABS held by the Company are generally collateralized by FFELP student loans, the majority of which benefit from a
97%
(or higher) government guarantee of principal and interest. For valuations of subordinate securities in the same structure, the Company adjusts valuations on the senior securities based on the likelihood that the issuer will refinance in the near term, a securitys level of subordination in the structure, and/or the perceived risk of the issuer as determined by credit ratings or total leverage of the trust. These adjustments may be significant; therefore, the subordinate student loan ARS held as trading assets continue to be classified as level 3.
Other level 3 AFS ABS includes interests in third party securitizations of auto loans and home equity lines of credit that are vintage 2003-2004. Third party pricing is generally available to price or validate the pricing on these positions, however, the Company believes that this third party pricing relied on a significant unobservable assumptions, as evidenced by a wide bid-ask range and variability in pricing received from the pricing services, and therefore the Company continues to classify these ABS as level 3.
During the first quarter of 2011, the Company sold the remaining ABS related to the assets acquired in 2007, including those received in the SIV liquidation that occurred in December 2010. This included
$31 million
of level 3 trading ABS collateralized by auto loans and home equity lines of credit.
Corporate and other debt securities
Corporate debt securities are predominantly comprised of senior and subordinate debt obligations of domestic corporations and are classified as level 2. Other debt securities in level 3 include bonds that are redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market; as such, no significant observable market data for these instruments is available.
Commercial paper
From time to time, the Company trades third party CP that is generally short-term in nature (less than
30
days) and highly rated. The Company estimates the fair value of the CP that it trades based on observable pricing from executed trades of similar instruments.
Equity securities
Level 1 equity securities, both trading and AFS, consist primarily of MMMFs that trade at a
$1
net asset value, which is considered the fair market value of those fund shares.
56
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Level 3 equity securities classified as trading as of
December 31, 2010
included nonmarketable preferred shares in municipal funds issues as ARS that the Company purchased as a result of the ARS market failing in 2008 and the resulting FINRA settlement described in Note
20
, "Contingencies." During the
year ended December 31, 2011
, the issuers of these ARS had redeemed at par all of the remaining shares that were held by the Company.
Level 3 equity securities classified as securities AFS include, as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
$740 million
and
$689 million
, respectively, of FHLB stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock, which are redeemable with the issuer at par and cannot be traded in the market. As such, no significant observable market data for these instruments is available. The Company accounts for the stock based on the industry guidance that requires these investments be carried at cost and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recovery of par value.
Derivative contracts (trading assets or trading liabilities)
With the exception of one derivative contract discussed herein and certain instruments discussed under other assets/liabilities, net that qualify as derivative instruments, the Companys derivative instruments are level 1 or 2 instruments. Level 1 derivative contracts generally include exchange-traded futures or option contracts for which pricing is readily available. See Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on the Companys derivative contracts.
The Companys level 2 instruments are predominantly standard OTC swaps, options, and forwards, with underlying market variables of interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. Because fair values for OTC contracts are not readily available, the Company estimates fair values using internal, but standard, valuation models that incorporate market-observable inputs. The valuation model is driven by the type of contract: for option-based products, the Company uses an appropriate option pricing model, such as Black-Scholes; for forward-based products, the Companys valuation methodology is generally a discounted cash flow approach. The primary drivers of the fair values of derivative instruments are the underlying variables, such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity, or credit. As such, the Company uses market-based assumptions for all of its significant inputs, such as interest rate yield curves, quoted exchange rates and spot prices, market implied volatilities and credit curves.
Derivative instruments are primarily transacted in the institutional dealer market and priced with observable market assumptions at a mid-market valuation point, with appropriate valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risk. For purposes of valuation adjustments to its derivative positions, the Company has evaluated liquidity premiums that may be demanded by market participants, as well as the credit risk of its counterparties and its own credit. The Company has considered factors such as the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties, its net exposures, and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate fair value adjustments to record. Generally, the expected loss of each counterparty is estimated using the Company's proprietary internal risk rating system. The risk rating system utilizes counterparty-specific probabilities of default and LGD estimates to derive the expected loss. For counterparties that are rated by national rating agencies, those ratings are also considered in estimating the credit risk. In addition, counterparty exposure is evaluated by netting positions that are subject to master netting arrangements, as well as considering the amount of marketable collateral securing the position. Specifically approved counterparties and exposure limits are defined. Creditworthiness of the approved counterparties is regularly reviewed and appropriate business action is taken to adjust the exposure to certain counterparties, as necessary. This approach used to estimate exposures to counterparties is also used by the Company to estimate its own credit risk on derivative liability positions.
The Agreements the Company entered into related to its Coke common stock are level 3 instruments, due to the unobservability of a significant assumption used to value these instruments. Because the value is primarily driven by the embedded equity collars on the Coke shares, a Black-Scholes model is the appropriate valuation model. Most of the assumptions are directly observable from the market, such as the per share market price of Coke common stock, interest rates, and the dividend rate on the Coke common stock. Volatility is a significant assumption and is impacted both by the unusually large size of the trade and the long tenor until settlement. Because the derivatives carry scheduled terms of
6.5
years and
7
years from the effective date and are on a significant number of Coke shares, the observable and active options market on Coke does not provide for any identical or similar instruments. As such, the Company receives estimated market values from a market participant who is knowledgeable about Coke equity derivatives and is active in the market. Based on inquiries of the market participant as to their procedures, as well as the Companys own valuation assessment procedures, the Company has satisfied itself that the market participant is using methodologies and assumptions that other market participants would use in estimating the fair value of The Agreements. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, The Agreements combined fair value was a liability of
$189 million
and
$145 million
, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Trading loans
The Company engages in certain businesses whereby the election to carry loans at fair value for financial reporting aligns with the underlying business purposes. Specifically, the loans that are included within this classification are: (i) loans made or acquired in connection with the Companys TRS business (see Note
11
, "Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities," and Note
17
, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion of this business), (ii) loans backed by the SBA, and (iii) the loan sales and trading business within the Companys CIB line of business. All of these loans have been classified as level 2, due to the market data that the Company uses in its estimates of fair value.
The loans made in connection with the Companys TRS business are short-term, demand loans, whereby the repayment is senior in priority and whose value is collateralized. While these loans do not trade in the market, the Company believes that the par amount of the loans approximates fair value and no unobservable assumptions are made by the Company to arrive at this conclusion. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company had outstanding
$1.7 billion
and
$972 million
, respectively, of such short-term loans carried at fair value.
SBA loans are similar to SBA securities discussed herein under Federal agency securities, except for their legal form. In both cases, the Company trades instruments that are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government as to contractual principal and interest and has sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base its estimates of fair value.
The loans from the Companys sales and trading business are commercial and corporate leveraged loans that are either traded in the market or for which similar loans trade. The Company elected to carry these loans at fair value in order to reflect the active management of these positions. The Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for substantially all of these loans using a third party valuation service that is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans are traded in the markets, the Company does not believe that trading activity qualifies the loans as level 1 instruments, as the volume and level of trading activity is subject to variability and the loans are not exchange-traded, such that the Company believes that level 2 is a more appropriate presentation of the underlying market activity for the loans. At
December 31, 2011 and 2010
,
$323 million
and
$381 million
, respectively, of loans related to the Companys trading business were held in inventory.
Loans and Loans Held for Sale
Residential LHFS
The Company recognized at fair value certain newly-originated mortgage LHFS based upon defined product criteria. The Company chooses to fair value these mortgage LHFS in order to eliminate the complexities and inherent difficulties of achieving hedge accounting and to better align reported results with the underlying economic changes in value of the loans and related hedge instruments. This election impacts the timing and recognition of origination fees and costs, as well as servicing value. Specifically, origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings when earned or incurred. The servicing value, which had been recorded as MSRs at the time the loan was sold, is included in the fair value of the loan and initially recognized at the time the Company enters into IRLCs with borrowers. The Company uses derivatives to economically hedge changes in servicing value as a result of including the servicing value in the fair value of the loan. The mark to market adjustments related to LHFS and the associated economic hedges are captured in mortgage production related (loss)/income.
Level 2 LHFS are primarily agency loans which trade in active secondary markets and are priced using current market pricing for similar securities adjusted for servicing and risk. Level 3 loans are primarily non-agency residential mortgages for which there is little to no observable trading activity of similar instruments in either the new issuance or secondary loan markets as either whole loans or as securities. Prior to the non-agency residential loan market disruption, which began during the third quarter of 2007 and continues, the Company was able to obtain certain observable pricing from either the new issuance or secondary loan market. However, as the markets deteriorated and certain loans were not actively trading as either whole loans or as securities, the Company began employing the same alternative valuation methodologies used to value level 3 residential MBS to fair value the loans.
As disclosed in the tabular level 3 rollforwards, transfers of certain mortgage LHFS into level 3 during 2011 were not due to using alternative valuation approaches, but were largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects impacting the marketability of the loans.
For residential loans that the Company has elected to carry at fair value, the Company has considered the component of the fair value changes due to instrument-specific credit risk, which is intended to be an approximation of the fair value change attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk. For the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, the Company recognized losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss) of
$15 million
,
$18 million
, and
$24
58
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
million
, respectively, due to changes in fair value attributable to borrower-specific credit risk. In addition to borrower-specific credit risk, there are other, more significant, variables that drive changes in the fair values of the loans, including interest rates and general conditions in the principal markets for the loans.
Corporate and other LHFS
As discussed in Note
11
, Certain Transfers of Financial Assets and Variable Interest Entities, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of a CLO vehicle, which resulted in the Company consolidating the loans of that vehicle. Because the CLO trades its loans from time to time and in order to fairly present the economics of the CLO, the Company elected to carry the loans of the CLO at fair value. The Company is able to obtain fair value estimates for substantially all of these loans using a third party valuation service that is broadly used by market participants. While most of the loans are traded in the markets, the Company does not believe the loans qualify as level 1 instruments, as the volume and level of trading activity is subject to variability and the loans are not exchange-traded, such that the Company believes that level 2 is more representative of the general market activity for the loans.
LHFI
Level 3 LHFI predominantly includes mortgage loans that have been deemed not marketable, largely due to borrower defaults or the identification of other loan defects. The Company values these loans using a discounted cash flow approach based on assumptions that are generally not observable in the current markets, such as prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates, and discount rates.
Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets that the Company records at fair value are the Companys MSR assets. The fair values of MSRs are determined by projecting cash flows, which are then discounted to estimate an expected fair value. The fair values of MSRs are impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics. For additional information, see Note
9
, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio. Because these inputs are not transparent in market trades, MSRs are considered to be level 3 assets.
Other Assets/Liabilities, net
The Companys other assets/liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis include IRLCs that satisfy the criteria to be treated as derivative financial instruments, derivative financial instruments that are used by the Company to economically hedge certain loans and MSRs, and the derivative that the Company obtained as a result of its sale of Visa Class B shares.
The fair value of IRLCs on residential mortgage LHFS, while based on interest rates observable in the market, is highly dependent on the ultimate closing of the loans. These pull-through rates are based on the Companys historical data and reflect the Companys best estimate of the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan. Servicing value is included in the fair value of IRLCs, and the fair value of servicing is determined by projecting cash flows which are then discounted to estimate an expected fair value. The fair value of servicing is impacted by a variety of factors, including prepayment assumptions, discount rates, delinquency rates, contractually specified servicing fees, servicing costs, and underlying portfolio characteristics. Because these inputs are not transparent in market trades, IRLCs are considered to be level 3 assets.
During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company transferred
$271 million
and
$398 million
, respectively, of IRLCs out of level 3 as the associated loans were closed.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with MSRs, IRLCs, mortgage LHFS, and mortgage LHFI reported at fair value. The Company hedges these exposures with a combination of derivatives, including MBS forward and option contracts, interest rate swap and swaption contracts, futures contracts, and eurodollar options. The Company estimates the fair values of such derivative instruments consistent with the methodologies discussed herein under Derivative contracts and accordingly these derivatives are considered to be level 2 instruments.
During the second quarter of 2009, in connection with its sale of Visa Class B shares, the Company entered into a derivative contract whereby the ultimate cash payments received or paid, if any, under the contract are based on the ultimate resolution of litigation involving Visa. The value of the derivative was estimated based on the Companys expectations regarding the ultimate resolution of that litigation, which involved a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. Accordingly, the value of the derivative liability was classified as a level 3 instrument.
59
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Liabilities
Trading liabilities
Trading liabilities are primarily comprised of derivative contracts, but also include various contracts involving U.S. Treasury securities, Federal agency securities, and corporate debt securities that the Company uses in certain of its trading businesses. The Company employs the same valuation methodologies for these derivative contracts and securities as are discussed within the corresponding sections herein under Trading Assets and Securities Available for Sale.
Brokered time deposits
The Company has elected to measure certain CDs at fair value. These debt instruments include embedded derivatives that are generally based on underlying equity securities or equity indices, but may be based on other underlyings that may or may not be clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The Company elected to carry these instruments at fair value in order to remove the mixed attribute accounting model for the single debt instrument or to better align the economics of the CDs with the Companys risk management strategies. The Company evaluated, on an instrument by instrument basis, whether a new issuance would be carried at fair value.
The Company has classified these CDs as level 2 instruments due to the Companys ability to reasonably measure all significant inputs based on observable market variables. The Company employs a discounted cash flow approach to the host debt component of the CD, based on observable market interest rates for the term of the CD and an estimate of the Banks credit risk. For the embedded derivative features, the Company uses the same valuation methodologies as if the derivative were a standalone derivative, as discussed herein under Derivative contracts.
For brokered time deposits carried at fair value, the Company estimated credit spreads above LIBOR, based on credit spreads from actual or estimated trading levels of the debt or other relevant market data. The Company recognized gains of
$2 million
, losses of
$41 million
, and losses of
$2 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively, due to changes in its own credit spread on its brokered time deposits carried at fair value.
Long-term debt
The Company has elected to carry at fair value certain fixed rate debt issuances of public debt which are valued by obtaining quotes from a third party pricing service and utilizing broker quotes to corroborate the reasonableness of those marks. Additionally, information from market data of recent observable trades and indications from buy side investors, if available, are taken into consideration as additional support for the value. Due to the availability of this information, the Company determined that the appropriate classification for the debt was level 2. The election to fair value the debt was made in order to align the accounting for the debt with the accounting for the derivatives without having to account for the debt under hedge accounting, thus avoiding the complex and time consuming fair value hedge accounting requirements.
The Companys public debt carried at fair value impacts earnings predominantly through changes in the Companys credit spreads as the Company has entered into derivative financial instruments that economically convert the interest rate on the debt from fixed to floating. The estimated earnings impact from changes in credit spreads above U.S. Treasury rates were gains of
$57 million
, losses of
$95 million
, and losses of
$233 million
for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively.
The Company also carries approximately
$289 million
of issued securities contained in a consolidated CLO at fair value in order to recognize the nonrecourse nature of these liabilities to the Company. Specifically, the holders of the liabilities are only paid interest and principal to the extent of the cash flows from the assets of the vehicle and the Company has no current or future obligations to fund any of the CLO vehicles liabilities. The Company has classified these securities as level 2, as the primary driver of their fair values are the loans owned by the CLO, which the Company has also elected to carry at fair value, as discussed herein under Loans and Loans Held for Sale  Corporate and other LHFS.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present the change in carrying value of those assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for which impairment was recognized. The table does not reflect the change in fair value attributable to any related economic hedges the Company may have used to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with LHFS and MSRs. The Companys economic hedging activities for LHFS are deployed at the portfolio level.
 
The following is a discussion of the valuation techniques and inputs used in developing fair value measurements for assets classified as level 2 or 3 that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, based on the class as determined by the nature and risks of the instrument.
Loans Held for Sale
Level 2 LHFS consist primarily of conforming, residential mortgage loans and corporate loans that are accounted for at LOCOM. Level 3 LHFS consist of non-agency residential mortgage LHFS for which there is little or no secondary market activity and leases held for sale. These loans are valued consistent with the methodology discussed in the Recurring Fair Value Measurement section of this footnote. Leases held for sale are valued using internal estimates which incorporate market data when available. Due to the lack of current market data for comparable leases, these assets are considered level 3.
During the
year ended December 31, 2011
, the Company transferred
$47 million
in NPLs, net of a
$10 million
incremental charge-off, that were previously designated as LHFI to LHFS in conjunction with the Companys election to actively market these loans for sale. These loans were predominantly reported at amortized cost prior to transferring to LHFS; however, a portion of the NPLs was carried at fair value. Of these transferred loans,
$34 million
were sold at approximately their carrying value during the
year ended December 31, 2011
; the remaining
$13 million
were returned to LHFI as they were no longer deemed marketable for sale. The Company executed a similar transfer of
$160 million
in NPLs during the
year ended December 31, 2010
; these loans were subsequently sold at prices approximating fair value.
63
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Loans Held for Investment
LHFI consist predominantly of nonperforming commercial real estate loans for which specific reserves have been recorded. As these loans have been classified as nonperforming, cash proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral is the expected source of repayment for a majority of these loans. Accordingly, the fair value of these loans is derived from internal estimates of the underlying collateral incorporating market data when available. Due to the lack of market data for similar assets, these loans are considered level 3.
OREO
OREO is measured at the lower of cost or its fair value less costs to sell. Level 2 OREO consists primarily of residential homes, commercial properties, and vacant lots and land for which current property-specific appraisals, broker pricing opinions, or other market information is available. Level 3 OREO consists of lots and land for which initial valuations are based on property-specific appraisals or internal valuations. Due to the lower dollar value per property and geographic dispersion of the portfolio, these properties are re-evaluated using a pooled approach, which applies geographic factors to adjust carrying values for estimated further declines in value. Land and lots have proven to be the most challenging asset class to accurately value due in part to the low balance per property composition of the asset class. The pooled discount methodology provides a means to reserve for losses across a broad band of assets rather than rely on potentially unreliable asset-specific valuations. The pooled discount methodology is applied to land and lot assets that have valuations older than six months and that have a net carrying value of less than $1 million. The Company's independent internal valuation group determines the discounts to be applied and the discount percentages are segregated by state and by asset class (residential or commercial). The discount percentages reflect the general market decline/increase in a particular state for a particular asset class and are determined by examining various valuation sources, including but not limited to, recent appraisals or sales prices of similar assets within each state.
Affordable Housing
The Company evaluates its consolidated affordable housing partnership investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment is recorded when the carrying amount of the partnership exceeds its fair value. Fair value measurements for affordable housing investments are derived from internal models using market assumptions when available. Significant assumptions utilized in these models include cash flows, market capitalization rates, and tax credit market pricing. Due to the lack of comparable sales in the marketplace, these valuations are considered level 3. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$10 million
and
$15 million
, respectively, on its consolidated affordable housing partnership investments.
Other Assets
Other assets consist of private equity investments, structured leasing products, other repossessed assets, and assets under operating leases where the Company is the lessor.
Investments in private equity partnerships are valued based on the estimated expected remaining cash flows to be received from these assets discounted at a market rate that is commensurate with their risk profile. Based on the valuation methodology and the lack of observable inputs, these investments are considered level 3. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$11 million
and
$5 million
, respectively, on its private equity partnership investments.
Structured leasing consists of assets held for sale under third party operating leases. These assets consist primarily of commercial buildings and are recognized at fair value less cost to sell. These assets are valued based on internal estimates which incorporate current market data for similar assets when available. Due to the lack of current market data for comparable assets, these assets are considered level 3. During the
year ended December 31, 2011
,
no
impairment was recognized. During the
year ended December 31, 2010
, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$3 million
on these assets.
Other repossessed assets consist of repossessed personal property that is measured at fair value less cost to sell. These assets are considered level 2 as their fair value is determined based on market comparables and broker opinions. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$1 million
and
$8 million
, respectively, on these assets.
The Company monitors the fair value of assets under operating leases where the Company is the lessor, and recognizes impairment to the extent the carrying value is not recoverable and the fair value is less than its carrying value. Fair value is determined using collateral specific pricing digests, external appraisals, and recent sales data from industry equipment dealers. As market data for similar assets is available and used in the valuation, these assets are considered level 2. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company recognized impairment charges of
$5 million
and
$12 million
, respectively, attributable to the fair value of various personal property under operating leases.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts and fair values of the Companys financial instruments at December 31 were as follows:
 
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of financial instruments:
The Company estimated fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted, initially, at current origination rates for loans with similar terms and credit quality, which derived an estimated value of
100%
and
99%
on the loan portfolios net carrying value as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The value derived from origination rates likely does not represent an exit price; therefore, an incremental market risk and liquidity discount was subtracted from the initial value as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively. The discounted value is a function of a market participants required yield in the current environment and is not a reflection of the expected cumulative losses on the loans. Loan prepayments are used to adjust future cash flows based on historical experience and prepayment model forecasts. The value of related accrued interest on loans approximates fair value; however, it is not included in the carrying amount or fair value of loans. The value of long-term customer relationships is not permitted under current U.S. GAAP to be included in the estimated fair value.

 CONTINGENCIES
Litigation and Regulatory Matters
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, and requests for information, and are also parties to numerous civil claims and lawsuits. Some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts. The Companys experience has shown that the damages alleged by plaintiffs or claimants are often overstated, based on novel or unsubstantiated legal theories, unsupported by the facts, and/or bear no relation to the ultimate award that a court might grant. Additionally, the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict. Because of these factors, the Company typically cannot provide a meaningful estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes of claims in the aggregate or by individual claim. On a case-by-case basis, however, reserves are established for those legal claims in which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. In no cases are those accrual amounts material to the financial condition of the Company. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.
For a limited number of legal matters in which the Company is involved, the Company is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses. For other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, such an estimate is not possible. For those matters where a loss is both estimable and reasonably possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses as
$140 million
to
$250 million
in excess of the accrued liability, if any, related to those matters. This estimated range of reasonably possible losses represents the estimated possible losses over the life of such legal matters, which may span a currently indeterminable number of years, and is based on information currently available as of
December 31, 2011
. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range; therefore, this estimated range does not represent the Companys maximum loss exposure. Based on current knowledge, it is the opinion of management that liabilities arising from legal claims in excess of the amounts currently accrued, if any, will not have a material impact to the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in light of the significant uncertainties involved in these matters, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Companys results or cash flows for any given reporting period.
The following is a description of certain litigation and regulatory matters.
Auction Rate Securities Investigations and Claims
FINRA Auction Rate Securities Investigation
In September 2008, STRH and STIS entered into an agreement in principle with FINRA related to the sales and brokering of ARS by STRH and STIS. This agreement was non-binding and subject to the negotiation of a final settlement. The parties were unable to finalize this agreement and FINRA continued its investigation. Beginning in late 2008, the Company moved forward with ARS purchases from essentially the same categories of investors who would have been covered by the original agreement with FINRA as well as certain other investors not addressed by the agreement. In 2010, FINRA notified the Company that it had completed its investigation and that it intended to recommend that charges be filed against both STRH and STIS. In 2011, both STRH and STIS entered into settlement agreements with FINRA under which each firm was assessed a fine and required to provide certain other relief, but neither firm was required to repurchase any additional ARS. The aggregate amount of these fines was
$5 million
and these fines were paid in 2011. Since 2008, the Company has purchased ARS with par amounts totaling
$617 million
as a result of the FINRA investigation and recognized cumulative losses through
December 31, 2011
of
$113 million
. The fair value of the remaining ARS purchased pursuant to the settlement, net of sales, redemptions, and calls, was approximately
$37 million
,
$147 million
, and
$176 million
in trading securities and
$100 million
,
$128 million
, and
$156 million
in securities AFS, at
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009
, respectively. The losses related to the FINRA agreement were accrued in 2008; however, during the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
, the Company recognized gains of
$33 million
and
$18 million
relating to these ARS, respectively. Gain and loss amounts are comprised of net trading gains and net securities gains resulting primarily from sales, calls, and redemptions of both trading securities and securities AFS that were purchased from investors, as well as, net mark to market gains on positions that continue to be held by the Company. Due to the pass-through nature of these security purchases, gains and losses are included in the Corporate Other segment.
In re LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc. et al.
Two
putative class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company by former customers of LandAmerica 1031 Exchange Services, Inc, (LES), a subsidiary of LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc. (LFG). The first of these actions,
Arthur et al. v. SunTrust Banks, Inc. et al.
, was filed on January 14, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The second of these cases,
Terry et al. v. SunTrust Banks, Inc. et al.
, was filed on February 2, 2009 in the Court of Common Pleas, Tenth Judicial Circuit, County of Anderson, South Carolina, and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. On June 12, 2009, the Multi-District Litigation (MDL) Panel issued a transfer order designating the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, Anderson Division, as MDL Court for IRS Section 1031 Tax Deferred Exchange Litigation (MDL 2054). Plaintiffs allegations in these cases are that LES and certain of its officers caused them to suffer damages in connection with potential 1031 exchange transactions that were pending at the time that LES filed for bankruptcy. Essentially, Plaintiffs core allegation is that their damages are the result of breaches of fiduciary and other duties owed to them by LES and others, fraud, and other improper acts committed by LES and certain of its officers, and that the Company is partially or entirely responsible for such damages because it knew or should have known about the alleged wrongdoing and failed to take appropriate steps to stop the same. The Company believes that the allegations and claims made against it in these actions are both factually and legally unsupported and has filed a motion to dismiss all claims. The Court granted this motion to dismiss with prejudice on June 15, 2011. Plaintiffs have appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Other ARS Claims
Since April 2008, several arbitrations and individual lawsuits have been filed against STRH and STIS by parties who purchased ARS through these entities. Broadly stated, these complaints allege that STRH and STIS made misrepresentations about the nature of these securities and engaged in conduct designed to mask some of the liquidity risk associated with them. They also allege that STRH and STIS were aware of the risks and problems associated with these securities and took steps in advance of the wave of auction failures to remove these securities from their own holdings. The claimants in these actions are seeking to recover the par value of the ARS in question as well as compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. The majority of these claims were settled during the
year ended December 31, 2011
. The Company reserved
$7 million
and
$16 million
as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010
, respectively, for estimated probable losses related to remaining other ARS claims. Losses related to the other ARS claims have been recognized in trading income/(loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Income/(Loss).
Interchange and Related Litigation
Card Association Antitrust Litigation
The Company is a defendant, along with Visa U.S.A. and MasterCard International (the Card Associations), as well as several other banks, in one of several antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of the Card Association (the Litigation). For a discussion regarding the Companys involvement in the Litigation matter, refer to Note
18
, Reinsurance Arrangements and Guarantees.
In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
The Company is a defendant in a number of antitrust actions that have been consolidated in federal court in San Francisco, California under the name
In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litigation
, Master File No. C04-2676 CR13. In these actions, Plaintiffs, on behalf of a class, assert that Concord EFS and a number of financial institutions have unlawfully fixed the interchange fee for participants in the Star ATM Network. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants conduct is illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs initially asserted the Defendants conduct was illegal
per se
. In August 2007, Concord and the bank defendants filed motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs
per se
claim. In March 2008, the Court granted the motions on the ground that Defendants conduct in setting an interchange fee must be analyzed under the rule of reason. The Court certified this question for interlocutory appeal, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected Plaintiffs petition for permission to appeal on August 13, 2008. Plaintiffs subsequently filed a Second Amended Complaint in which they asserted a rule of reason claim. This complaint was dismissed by the Court as well, but Plaintiffs were given leave to file another amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed yet another complaint and Defendants moved to dismiss the same. The Court granted this motion in part by dismissing one of the Plaintiffs two claims-but denied the motion as to one claim. On September 16, 2010, the Court granted the Defendants motion for summary judgment as to the remaining claim on the grounds that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert that claim. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal of this decision with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the parties are awaiting that court's decision.
Overdraft Fee Cases
The Company has been named as a defendant in two putative class actions relating to the imposition of overdraft fees on customer accounts. The first such case,
Buffington et al. v. SunTrust Banks, Inc. et al.
was filed in Fulton County Superior Court on May 6, 2009. This action was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division on June 10, 2009, and was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida for inclusion in Multi-District Litigation Case No. 2036 on December 1, 2009. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, conversion, unconscionability, and unjust enrichment for alleged injuries they suffered as a result of the method of posting order used by the Company, which allegedly resulted in overdraft fees being assessed to their joint checking account, and purport to bring their action on behalf of a putative class of all SunTrust Bank account holders who incurred an overdraft charge despite their account having a sufficient balance of actual funds to cover all debits that have been submitted to the bank for payment, as well as all SunTrust account holders who incurred one or more overdraft charges based on SunTrust Banks reordering of charges. Plaintiffs seek restitution, damages, expenses of litigation, attorneys fees, and other relief deemed equitable by the Court. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Compel Arbitration and both motions were denied. The denial of the motion to compel arbitration was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit remanded this matter back to the District Court with instructions to the District Court to review its prior ruling in light of the Supreme Courts decision in
AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion.
The District Court has since denied SunTrust's motion to compel arbitration for different reasons and SunTrust is in the process of appealing this decision to the Eleventh Circuit.
The second of these cases,
Bickerstaff v. SunTrust Bank,
was filed in the Fulton County State Court on July 12, 2010 and an amended complaint was filed on August 9, 2010. Plaintiff asserts that all overdraft fees charged to his account which related to debit card and ATM transactions are actually interest charges and therefore subject to the usury laws of Georgia. Plaintiff has brought claims for violations of civil and criminal usury laws, conversion, and money had and received, and purports to bring the action on behalf of all Georgia citizens who have incurred such overdraft fees within the last four years where the overdraft fee resulted in an interest rate being charged in excess of the usury rate. SunTrust has filed a motion to compel arbitration and that motion is pending.
SunTrust Mortgage, Inc. v United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company of North Carolina
STM filed a suit in the Eastern District of Virginia in July of 2009 against United Guaranty Residential Insurance Company of North Carolina (UGRIC) seeking payment involving denied mortgage insurance claims regarding second lien mortgages. STMs claims are in two counts. Count One involves a common reason for denial of claims by UGRIC for a group of loans. Count Two involves a group of loans with individualized reasons for the claim denials asserted by UGRIC. The two counts filed by STM have been bifurcated for trial purposes. UGRIC has counterclaimed for declaratory relief involving interpretation of the insurance policy involving certain caps on the amount of claims covered, whether ongoing premium obligations exist after any caps are met, and the potential to accelerate any premiums that may be owed if UGRIC prevails on its counterclaim. UGRIC later disclaimed its argument for acceleration of premiums. The Court granted STMs motion for summary judgment as to liability on Count One and, after a trial on damages, awarded STM
$34 million
along with
$6 million
in prejudgment interest on August 19, 2011. Count Two has been stayed pending final resolution of Count One. On September 13, 2011, the Court added
$5 million
to the judgment involving STM's claims for fees on certain issues. On UGRICs counterclaim, the Court agreed that UGRICs interpretation was correct regarding STMs continued obligations to pay premiums in the future after coverage caps are met. However, on August 19, 2011, the Court found for STM on its affirmative defense that UGRIC can no longer enforce the contract due to its prior breaches, and consequently, denied UGRIC's request for a declaration that it was entitled to continue to collect premiums after caps are met. UGRIC has filed an appeal of the Court's rulings.
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. Litigation
Beginning in October 2008, STRH, along with other underwriters and individuals, were named as defendants in several individual and putative class action complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and state and federal courts in Arkansas, California, Texas and Washington. Plaintiffs allege violations of Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 for allegedly false and misleading disclosures in connection with various debt and preferred stock offerings of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. ("Lehman Brothers") and seek unspecified damages. All cases have now been transferred for coordination to the multi-district litigation captioned
In re Lehman Brothers Equity/Debt Securities Litigation
pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss all claims asserted in the class action. On July 27, 2011, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss the class claims against STRH and the other underwriter defendants. A settlement with the class plaintiffs was approved by the Court on December 15, 2011. The class action now will go through a notice and opt-out process in which members of the class, including many of the plaintiffs in the pending individual lawsuits, will have to decide whether to participate in the class settlement or not. In the individual lawsuits for which the plaintiff decides to opt out of the class settlement, if any, the cases will move forward each on its own schedule. Motions to dismiss are either pending or will be filed in each of these cases.
Krinsk v. SunTrust Bank
This is a lender liability action in which the borrower claims that the Company has taken actions in violation of her home equity line of credit agreement and in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Plaintiff filed this action in March 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida as a putative class action. The Court dismissed portions of Plaintiffs first complaint, and she subsequently filed an amended complaint asserting breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of TILA. Plaintiff has filed a motion seeking to certify a class of all Florida borrowers. The Company filed its answer to the complaint, has opposed class certification, and has filed a motion to compel arbitration. The Court denied the motion to compel arbitration and this decision was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Eleventh Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling that SunTrust had waived its right to compel arbitration and remanded the case back to the District Court to decide the merits of SunTrust's motion to compel arbitration. In January 2012, the District Court granted SunTrust's motion to compel arbitration in this matter.
SunTrust Securities Class Action Litigation
Beginning in May 2009, the Company, STRH, SunTrust Capital IX, officers and directors of the Company, and others were named in
three
putative class actions arising out of the offer and sale of approximately
$690 million
of SunTrust Capital IX
7.875%
Trust Preferred Securities (TRUPs) of SunTrust Banks, Inc. The complaints alleged, among other things, that the relevant registration statement and accompanying prospectus misrepresented or omitted material facts regarding the Companys allowance for loan and lease loss reserves, the Companys capital position, and its internal risk controls. Plaintiffs seek to recover alleged losses in connection with their investment in the TRUPs or to rescind their purchases of the TRUPs. These cases were consolidated under the caption
Belmont Holdings Corp., et al., v. SunTrust Banks, Inc., et al.
, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, and on November 30, 2009, a consolidated amended complaint was filed. On January 29, 2010, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. This motion was granted, with leave to amend, on September 10, 2010. On October 8, 2010, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint in an attempt to address the pleading deficiencies identified in the Courts dismissal decision. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on March 21, 2011. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss as to Plaintiff's claims that the Company misrepresented the adequacy of its loan loss reserves for 2007 but dismissed all other claims against the Company and limited discovery in the initial stages of the case to the question of SunTrust's subjective belief as to the adequacy of those reserves at the time of the offering. SunTrust subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision and a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of that motion. The Court granted the motion to stay and the parties are awaiting a decision on the motion for reconsideration.
SunTrust Shareholder Derivative Litigation
On September 9, 2011, the Company and several current and former executives and members of the Board were named in a shareholder derivative action filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia,
Sharon Benfield v. James M. Wells, III. et al.,
and on December 19, 2011, the Company and several current and former executives and members of the Board were named as defendants in a separate shareholder derivative action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,
Edward Mannato v. James M. Wells, III, et al.
The plaintiffs in both of these lawsuits purport to bring their claims on behalf of and for the benefit of the Company. Generally, these lawsuits are substantially overlapping and make very broad allegations of mis-management of, and mis-representations about, the Company's exposure to loan losses and the residential real estate market leading up to and during the recent real estate and credit market crises. In both cases, the plaintiffs assert causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The
Mannato
lawsuit arises out of a shareholder demand made of SunTrust in March 2008 that was the subject of an investigation conducted at the direction of a committee of independent members of the Company's Board. This committee concluded that no wrongdoing had occurred and that the interests of the Company's shareholders would not be served by pursuing the claims alleged in the plaintiff's demand. The
Benfield
lawsuit arises out of a shareholder demand made of SunTrust in February 2011 that is the subject of an ongoing investigation conducted at the direction of the same Board committee. The Company has filed a motion to stay this case pending the outcome of this investigation.
Colonial BancGroup Securities Litigation
Beginning in July 2009, STRH, certain other underwriters, The Colonial BancGroup, Inc. (Colonial BancGroup) and certain officers and directors of Colonial BancGroup were named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern District entitled
In re Colonial BancGroup, Inc. Securities Litigation.
The complaint was brought by purchasers of certain debt and equity securities of Colonial BancGroup and seeks unspecified damages. Plaintiffs allege violations of Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 due to allegedly false and misleading disclosures in the relevant registration statement and prospectus relating to Colonial BancGroups goodwill impairment, mortgage underwriting standards, and credit quality. On August 28, 2009, The Colonial BancGroup filed for bankruptcy. The Defendants motion to dismiss was denied in May 2010, but the Court subsequently has ordered Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. This amended complaint has been filed and the defendants have filed a motion to dismiss.
U.S. Department of Justice Investigation
Since late 2009, STM has been cooperating with the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) in connection with an investigation relating to alleged violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. STM recently has been informed by the USDOJ that it intends to file a lawsuit against STM in this matter if the parties are unable to reach a settlement. To the best of STMs knowledge, the USDOJs allegations in this matter relate solely to prior periods and to alleged practices of STM that no longer are in effect. The parties are engaged in settlement discussions, but there may be significant disagreements about the appropriateness and validity of the methodology and analysis upon which USDOJ has based its allegations.
Consent Order with the Federal Reserve
On April 13, 2011 SunTrust Banks, Inc., SunTrust Bank, and STM entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve in which SunTrust Banks, Inc., SunTrust Bank, and STM agreed to strengthen oversight of and improve risk management, internal audit, and compliance programs concerning the residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure activities of STM. Under the terms of the Consent Order, SunTrust Bank and STM also agreed to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending at any time during the period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 for loans serviced by STM, to identify any errors, misrepresentations or deficiencies, determine whether any instances so identified resulted in financial injury, and then make any appropriate remediation, reimbursement or adjustment. Additionally, borrowers who had a residential foreclosure action pending during this two year review period have been solicited through advertising and direct mailings to request a review by the independent consultant of their case if they believe they incurred a financial injury as a result of errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies in the foreclosure process. A direct mail solicitation was completed on November 28, 2011. The deadline for submitting requests for review is July 31, 2012. Reviews by the independent consultant are currently underway. Under the terms of the Consent Order, SunTrust Bank and STM also agreed, among other things, to: (a) strengthen the coordination of communications between borrowers and STM concerning ongoing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities; (b) submit a plan to enhance processes for oversight and management of third party vendors used in connection with residential mortgage servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure activities; (c) enhance and strengthen the enterprise-wide compliance program with respect to oversight of residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure activities; (d) ensure appropriate oversight of STMs activities with respect to Mortgage Electronic Registration System; (e) review and remediate, if necessary, STMs management information systems for its residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure activities; (f) improve the training of STM officers and staff concerning applicable law, supervisory guidance and internal procedures concerning residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, including the single point of contact for foreclosure and loss mitigation; (g) retain an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive assessment of STM's risks, including, but not limited to, operational, compliance, transaction, legal, and reputational risks particularly in the areas of residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure; (h) enhance and strengthen the enterprise-wide risk management program with respect to oversight of residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure activities; and (i) enhance and strengthen the internal audit program with respect to residential loan servicing, loss mitigation and foreclosure activities. The comprehensive third party risk assessment was completed in August 2011, and the Company has begun implementation of recommended enhancements. Many of the action plans designed to complete the above enhancements were accepted by the Federal Reserve during the fourth quarter of 2011 and are currently in implementation. The full text of the Consent Order is available on the Federal Reserves website and is filed as Exhibit 10.25 to this Form 10-K.
The Company completed an internal review of STMs residential foreclosure processes, and as a result of the review, steps have been taken and continue to be taken, to improve upon those processes. As discussed above, the Consent Order requires the Company to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of residential foreclosure actions pending during 2009 and 2010. Until the results of that review are known, the Company cannot reasonably estimate financial reimbursements or adjustments. As a result of the Federal Reserves review of the Companys residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing practices that preceded the Consent Order, the Federal Reserve announced that it would impose a civil money penalty. At this time, no such penalty has been imposed, and the amount and terms of such a potential penalty have not been finally determined. The Company's accrual for expected costs related to a potential settlement with the U.S. and the States Attorneys General regarding certain mortgage servicing claims (which is discussed below at "United States and States Attorneys General Mortgage Servicing Claims") includes the expected incremental costs (if any) of a civil money penalty relating to the Consent Order.
A Financial Guaranty Insurance Company
The Company is engaged in settlement negotiations with a financial guaranty insurance company relating to second lien mortgage loan repurchase claims for a securitization that the financial guaranty insurance company guaranteed under an insurance policy. The financial guaranty insurance companys allegations in this matter generally are that it has paid claims as a result of defaults in the underlying loans and that some of these losses are the result of breaches of representations and warranties made in the documents governing the transaction in question.
Putative ERISA Class Actions
Company Stock Class Action
Beginning in July 2008, the Company, officers and directors of the Company, and certain other Company employees were named in a putative class action alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by offering the Company's common stock as an investment option in the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the Plan). The plaintiffs purport to represent all current and former Plan participants who held the Company stock in their Plan accounts from May 2007 to the present and seek to recover alleged losses these participants supposedly incurred as a result of their investment in Company stock.
The Company Stock Class Action was originally filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, but was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, (the District Court) in November 2008.
On October 26, 2009, an amended complaint was filed. On December 9, 2009, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On October 25, 2010, the District Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Defendants and plaintiffs filed separate motions for the District Court to certify its October 25, 2010 order for immediate interlocutory appeal. On January 3, 2011, the District Court granted both motions.

Metropolitan Bank Group, Inc. v. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
On March 8, 2011, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey (STRH) was served with a notice of claim initiating a FINRA arbitration against the Company and one employee by Metropolitan Bank Group, Inc. In this case, the plaintiff alleges that it purchased approximately
$80 million
in preferred securities through STRH on which it suffered significant losses. The plaintiff alleges that it subsequently was informed by its primary regulator that it was not permitted to own certain of these securities and that STRH was or should have been aware of that fact. The plaintiff also alleges that certain of the securities in question were not suitable for it because they were too risky. The plaintiff has asserted causes of action for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of FINRA rules. The arbitration hearing in this case is scheduled for May 2012.
SunTrust Mortgage Reinsurance Class Actions
STM and Twin Rivers Insurance Company ("Twin Rivers") have been named as defendants in two putative class actions alleging that the companies entered into illegal captive reinsurance arrangements with private mortgage insurers. More specifically, plaintiffs allege that SunTrusts selection of private mortgage insurers who agree to reinsure loans referred to them by SunTrust with Twin Rivers results in illegal kickbacks in the form of the insurance premiums paid to Twin Rivers. Plaintiffs contend that this arrangement violates the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and results in unjust enrichment to the detriment of borrowers. The first of these cases,
Thurmond, Christopher, et al. v. SunTrust Banks, Inc. et al.
, was filed in February 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This case currently has been stayed by the Court pending the outcome of
Edwards v. First American Financial Corporation
, a captive reinsurance case currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. The second of these cases,
Acosta, Lemuel & Maria Ventrella et al. v. SunTrust Bank, SunTrust Mortgage, Inc., et al.,
was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in December 2011. The Company intends to seek to have this case stayed pending a decision in the
Edwards
case also.
United States and States Attorneys General Mortgage Servicing Claims
I
n January, 2012, the Company commenced discussions related to a mortgage servicing settlement with the U.S., through the Department of Justice, and Attorneys General for several states regarding various potential claims relating to the Company's mortgage servicing activities. While these discussions are in the preliminary stages and the Company has not reached any agreement with such parties, the Company estimates that the cost of resolving these and potential similar claims, including the costs of such a settlement, borrower-specific actions, and/or legal matters to defend such claims if they are not settled, will be approximately
$120 million
, pre-tax, (
$81 million
, after-tax), and the Company has accrued this expense in the 2011 financial results of the Company. Notwithstanding the fact that the Company did not enter into material discussions until 2012, applicable accounting standards required that this estimate be reflected in the Company's financial results as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2011 because the facts underlying such claims existed as of December 31, 2011. See Note

- BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company has
three
business segments used to measure business activity: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, and Mortgage Banking, with the remainder in Corporate Other. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management. The segment structure was revised during the first quarter of 2012 from the six segments the Company utilized during 2011 and 2010. The revised segment structure was done in conjunction with organizational changes made throughout the Company that were announced during the fourth quarter of 2011 and implemented in the first quarter of 2012. The following is a description of the new segments and their composition.
The Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment is made up of two primary businesses: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management.
The Wholesale Banking segment includes the following six businesses:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
offering equipment lease financing solutions, is also managed within this segment.
The Mortgage Banking segment offers residential mortgage products nationally through its retail, broker, and correspondent channels, as well as via the internet (
www.suntrust.com
) and by telephone (1-800-SUNTRUST). These products are either sold in the secondary market, primarily with servicing rights retained, or held in the Company's loan portfolio. The line of business services loans for itself, for other SunTrust lines of business, and for other investors. The line of business also includes ValuTree Real Estate Services, LLC, a tax service subsidiary.
Corporate Other includes management of the Company's investment securities portfolio, long-term debt, end user derivative instruments, short-term liquidity and funding activities, balance sheet risk management, and most real estate assets. Other components include Enterprise Information Services, which is the primary information technology and operations group; the Corporate Real Estate group, Marketing, SunTrust Online, Human Resources, Finance, Corporate Risk Management, Legal and Compliance, Branch Operations, Communications, Procurement, and Executive Management.
Because the business segment results are presented based on management accounting practices, the transition to the consolidated results, which are prepared under U.S. GAAP, creates certain differences which are reflected in Reconciling Items.
For business segment reporting purposes, the basis of presentation in the accompanying discussion includes the following:
The segments financial performance is comprised of direct financial results as well as various allocations that for internal management reporting purposes provide an enhanced view of analyzing the segments financial performance. The internal allocations include the following:

allocations are in Corporate Other.
The application and development of management reporting methodologies is a dynamic process and is subject to periodic enhancements. The implementation of these enhancements to the internal management reporting methodology may materially affect the results disclosed for each segment with no impact on consolidated results. Whenever significant changes to management reporting methodologies take place, the impact of these changes is quantified and prior period information is reclassified wherever practicable.
