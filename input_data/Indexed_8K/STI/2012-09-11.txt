2 Important Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements The following should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes and other information contained in the Companys 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe SunTrusts performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided within or in the appendix of this presentation. In this presentation, net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, and ratios are presented on an annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. This presentation contains forward-looking statements. Statements about (a)expected efficiency expense savings, (b) normalization of cyclically high expenses, (c) expected increases in Tier 1 common capital as a result of the sale of the Coke shares; and (d) the expected level of future incurred losses on pre-2009 loans sold to GSEs, and the related provision expense, are forward looking statements. Also, any statement that does not describe historical or current facts is a forward-looking statement. These statements often include the words believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, plans, goals, targets, initiatives, potential or potentially, probably, projects, outlook or similar expressions or future conditional verbs such as may, will, should, would, and could. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and on information currently available to management. Such statements speak as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update these statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those contained in such statements in light of new information or future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on such statements. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Item 1A of Part II of our 10-K and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: we may not achieve targeted level of expense reductions and efficiency goals; if in the future we incur additional loan losses, then we will need to record additional mortgage repurchase provision expense; if in the future we receive greater levels of mortgage repurchase requests than expected, then we may will need to record additional mortgage repurchase provision expense; difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry; concerns over market volatility continue; the Dodd-Frank Act makes fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry, some of which may adversely affect our business; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; emergency measures designed to stabilize the U.S. banking system are beginning to wind down; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; we rely on our systems, employees, and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect our operations; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we may not pay dividends on your common stock; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may negatively affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, our operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

12 Looking Ahead: Focused on Improved Efficiency and Profitable Growth
 
13 Normalization of Cyclically High Expenses Expected to Result in Meaningful Efficiency Ratio Improvement 1. Based on June 30, 2012 YTD results 2. YTD noninterest income and expense adjustment items shown in the appendix are annualized 3. Credit-related expenses include credit expense, collections expense, and OREO expense as outlined on the following slide 4. $250 million in PPG expense savings have been achieved at the end of 2Q 12, and $50 million reflects the incremental savings expected to be achieved to reach the programs $300 million target 5. Tangible Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP) excludes $44 million intangible amortization from total expenses. Efficiency Ratios (GAAP) for 2012 YTD Annualized and 2012 Normalized would be 69.2% and 60.2%, respectively NOTES  This chart is intended for illustrative purposes, showing normalizations of the mortgage repurchase reserve provision and credit-related noninterest expenses, both of which are cyclically-high and expected to drive meaningful improvements in the efficiency ratio in the coming years. The actual path to the stated goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio will likely differ from this depiction.  The columns titled Potential Normalizations and Normalized are not projections of future results.
