Results
Results Driven by Favorable Trends in Core Performance and Previously Announced Actions to Improve Risk Profile and Strengthen Balance Sheet

$1.1 billion
, or
$1.98
per average common diluted share, for the
third quarter
of
2012
. Third quarter results include the impact of previously announced actions to improve the Company's risk profile and strengthen its balance sheet. Including these transactions, which are outlined below, earnings per average common diluted share increased
$1.48
from the
second quarter
of
2012
and
$1.59
from the
third quarter
of
2011
. For the first
nine months

$0.81
per share earned in the same period last year.
Third Quarter Impact of Previously Announced Actions to Improve Risk Profile and Strengthen the Balance Sheet
This quarter's actions more favorably position the Company for the future. In addition, we demonstrated another quarter of improved core performance, said William H. Rogers, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of SunTrust Banks, Inc. As we manage through the challenging revenue environment, we remain intensely focused on deepening client relationships and improving efficiency. Mr. Rogers noted that favorable core performance trends include strong mortgage production income, continued commercial and industrial loan growth, solid noninterest bearing deposit account gains, and a marked decrease in nonperforming loans.

Consolidated Financial Performance Details
(Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted)
Revenue
Total revenue was
$3.8 billion
for the
third quarter
of
2012
, an increase of
$1.6 billion
from both the prior quarter and the
third quarter
of
2011
. Net gains from the sales of securities were
$1.9 billion
for the
third quarter
of
2012
, substantially all from the sale of KO shares, compared to
$14 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
$2 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. Excluding net securities gains, total revenue declined
$330 million
and
$292 million
compared to the
second quarter
of
2012
and
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The decline was primarily related to the actions taken in the third quarter of 2012, which included a higher provision for mortgage repurchases and losses related to the transfer to held for sale of student and mortgage loans.
For the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, total revenue, excluding securities gains and losses, was
$6.3 billion
, down
$121 million
compared to the first
nine months
of
2011
. The decline was driven by the same factors described in the quarterly comparison, as well as a decline in card fees of
$126 million
.
Net Interest Income
For the
third quarter
of
2012
, net interest income was
$1,301 million
compared to
$1,306 million
for the prior quarter and
$1,293 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The slight decline from the
second quarter
of
2012
was largely driven by the $15 million of foregone dividend income as a result of the sale of the KO shares, partially offset by one additional day and reduced funding costs in the current quarter. The
1%
increase in net interest income compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
was due to higher average loan balances and the favorable shift in deposit mix.
3
Net interest margin for the
third quarter
of
2012
was
3.38%
, a decline of
1
basis point from the
second quarter
of
2012
and a decline of
11
basis points from the
third quarter
of
2011
. On a sequential quarter basis, the decline was primarily driven by the aforementioned decline in KO dividend income and lower loan yields resulting in a
13
basis point decline in earning asset yields. This decline was largely offset by a
14
basis point reduction in interest-bearing liabilities, due to lower deposit rates and the benefit from redeeming $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities early in the third quarter. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
, the net interest margin decline was primarily due to a
42
basis point decline in loan yields, the result of the continued low interest rate environment, and a decline in commercial loan-related swap income. This was partially offset by a
33
basis point decline in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities due to lower rates paid on deposits, primarily due to the shift towards lower-cost accounts, lower long-term debt rates, and a reduction in long-term debt.
For the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, net interest income was $
3,949 million
compared to $
3,855 million
in 2011, an increase of
$94 million
, or
2%
. Net interest margin was
3.42%
in
2012
compared to
3.52%
in
2011
. The primary drivers of the increase in net interest income were growth in average earning assets and a favorable shift in the deposit mix, partially offset by lower yields on earning assets. The decline in net interest margin was due to lower yields on average earning assets.
Noninterest Income
Total noninterest income was
$2,542 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$940 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
$903 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The
$1.6 billion
increases from both the prior quarter and prior year quarter were primarily driven by
$1.9 billion
in securities gains, partially offset by a higher mortgage repurchase provision and losses related to the transfer to held for sale of certain student and mortgage loans.
Mortgage production income for the third quarter of 2012 was a loss of
$64 million
compared to income of
$103 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and income of
$54 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The
$167 million
sequential quarter decrease was driven by a $216 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Excluding the third quarter and second quarter 2012 mortgage repurchase provisions of $371 million and $155 million, respectively, mortgage production income increased sequentially by $49 million, driven by strong mortgage production volume and improved margins. As of
September 30
,
2012
, the reserve for mortgage repurchases totaled $694 million, an increase of $260 million from the prior quarter. The increase was recorded as a result of recent information received from the GSEs, as well as the Company's recent experience related to full file requests and repurchase demands, which enhanced its ability to estimate losses attributable to the remaining expected demands from defaulted or currently delinquent loans sold to the GSEs prior to 2009. These vintage loans have comprised the vast majority of mortgage repurchase losses to date; as such, future mortgage repurchase provisions are expected to decline substantially from levels experienced in recent quarters. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
, mortgage production income declined
$118 million
, due to the $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, partially offset by higher loan production and increased margins.
Mortgage servicing income was
$64 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$70 million
for the prior quarter and
$58 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The
$6 million
sequential quarter decline was due to lower servicing fee income. The $6 million increase from the
third quarter
of
2011
was due to better hedge performance, partially offset by a decline in servicing fee income, as the mortgage servicing portfolio declined to
$150 billion
at the end of the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$161 billion
at
September 30
,
2011
.
Other noninterest income for the third quarter of 2012 was a loss of
$31 million
versus income of
$53 million
in both the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2011. The
$84 million
declines from the previous quarters were attributable to the aforementioned $92 million loss recognized in the current quarter upon moving certain student and mortgage loans to loans held for sale.
Card fees were
$55 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$66 million
for the prior quarter and
$104 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The
$11 million
sequential quarter decrease was due to the reclassification of credit card rewards costs; these costs were previously recorded as a noninterest expense, but beginning in the third quarter of 2012 they are reflected as a contra-revenue item within card fees. The
$49 million
, or
47%
, decline from the prior year quarter was primarily the result of regulations on debit card interchange fees that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011, as well as the aforementioned reclassification of rewards costs.
4
Investment banking income was
$83 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$75 million
for the prior quarter and
$68 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter increase was due to higher syndicated finance fees. The increase relative to the
third quarter
of
2011
was primarily attributable to higher syndicated finance and bond origination fee income.
Trading income was
$19 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$70 million
for the prior quarter and
$66 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The
$51 million
sequential quarter decrease was primarily attributable to a $45 million increase in mark-to-market losses on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs during the current quarter as credit spreads improved. The
$47 million
decline in trading income compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
was largely driven by the increase in mark-to-market losses on the Company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs compared to gains in 2011, partially offset by higher core trading income and a decline in losses related to previously securitized loans.
For the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, noninterest income was
$4.4 billion
compared to
$2.7 billion
in the same period in
2011
. The
$1.7 billion
, or
62%
, increase was primarily driven by higher securities gains partially offset by lower card fees and losses from the transfer to held for sale of student and mortgage loans described above.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was
$1,726 million
for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
$1,546 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
$1,560 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter increase of
$180 million
was primarily due to the $96 million loss related to the expected sale of affordable housing investments, the $38 million charitable contribution of the KO shares to the SunTrust Foundation, and $29 million in severance expense. Compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
, the
$166 million
increase was due to the aforementioned third quarter of 2012 items and higher personnel expenses, partially offset by declines in FDIC assessment premiums. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company eliminated additional expenses through its Playbook for Profitable Growth ("PPG") program; the total annualized PPG savings now exceed the $300 million goal for the program.
Employee compensation and benefits expense increased
$18 million
from the prior quarter, primarily attributable to
the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with organizational changes, as well as higher contract labor costs.
The
$30 million
, or
4%
, increase in employee compensation and benefits expense compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
was also due to the same factors discussed above, as well as higher incentive compensation from improved business performance
. As of September 30, 2012, the Company's total full-time equivalent employees were
28,000
, which was
324
employees lower than the prior quarter and
1,483
employees lower than the same quarter last year.
Other noninterest expense was
$402 million
in the current quarter, an increase of
$117 million
from the second quarter of 2012 and
$93 million
from the third quarter of last year. The increases from the prior periods were primarily due to specific third quarter 2012 actions, including the $96 million loss related to the affordable housing investments, $29 million in severance expense, and $17 million in real estate charges as the Company reassessed some of its corporate real estate leases and holdings. This was partially offset by the reclassification of credit card rewards costs. Additionally, credit-related expenses, which are comprised of other real estate expenses and credit and collection costs, also declined. Such expenses fell $18 million and $38 million compared to the
second quarter
of
2012
and the
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively, primarily due to a decline in losses recognized on OREO.
FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments increased
$7 million
on a sequential quarter basis and declined
$13 million
compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
due to fluctuations in the Company's assessment rate. Outside processing and software declined
$9 million
on a sequential quarter basis due to a decline in transaction processing expenses and lower software amortization. Amortization of intangible assets increased
$6 million
from both the prior quarter and prior year due to the recognition of goodwill impairment associated with a wealth management business. Losses on debt extinguishment declined by
$11 million
sequentially, due to the
$13 million
second quarter 2012 charge related to the redemption of higher cost trust preferred securities.
For the
nine months ended
September 30, 2012
, noninterest expense was
$4,813 million
compared to
$4,567 million
in
2011
. The
$246
million, or
5%
, increase was primarily due to the third quarter 2012 actions as described in the quarterly comparisons above. Additionally, higher employee compensation, outside processing and software,
5
and operating losses were partially offset by declines in OREO expenses and FDIC insurance premiums and regulatory assessments.
Income Taxes
For the
third quarter
of
2012
, the Company recorded an income tax provision of
$551 million
compared to
$91 million
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
$45 million
in the
third quarter
of
2011
. The effective tax rate was
34
% for the
third quarter
of
2012
compared to
25
% for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
17
% for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings.
U.S. Treasury Preferred Dividends
The Company formerly paid dividends to the U.S. Treasury on its $4.85 billion of TARP preferred securities through the first quarter of 2011. The Company redeemed these shares at the end of the first quarter of 2011 and, therefore, did not pay such dividends during
2012
or the last three quarters of 2011. The
nine months ended
September 30
,
2011
included
$66 million
of preferred dividends paid to the U.S. Treasury and a
$74 million
, or
$0.14
per common share, non-cash charge related to the unamortized discount that was recognized upon the redemption of the TARP preferred shares.
Balance Sheet
As of
September 30
,
2012
, the Company had total assets of
$173.2 billion
and shareholders equity of
$20.4 billion
, representing
12%
of total assets. Both book value and tangible book value per common share remained relatively stable to the prior quarter and were
$37.35
and
$25.72
, respectively, as of
September 30
,
2012
.
Loans
Average loans for the
third quarter
of
2012
were
$124.1 billion
compared to average loans of
$123.4 billion
and
$115.6 billion
during the
second quarter
of
2012
and
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively. On a sequential quarter basis, the $
0.7 billion
, or
1%
, growth was concentrated in commercial and industrial loans, which increased
$1.1 billion
, and consumer indirect loans, which increased
$0.3 billion
. Partially offsetting the growth were decreases of
$0.4 billion
in government-guaranteed mortgage loans, primarily due to the sale of approximately $0.5 billion of such loans during the second quarter,
$0.2 billion
in home equity loans, and
$0.2 billion
in nonaccrual loans.
Average loans increased
$8.4 billion
, or
7%
, over the
third quarter
of
2011
. Growth was primarily driven by commercial and industrial, which increased
$5.7 billion
, or
12%
, as well as government-guaranteed student and residential mortgage loans, up a combined
$3.5 billion
. Additionally, high credit-quality nonguaranteed residential loans and indirect loans increased by
$1.0 billion
and
$0.8 billion
, respectively. Partially offsetting these areas of loan growth were declines in certain real estate-related loan categories that were actively managed down. The reduction in certain real estate-related loans, together with an increase in government-guaranteed loans, has resulted in an improvement in the risk profile of the loan portfolio compared to a year ago.
Loan balances at quarter end for the
third quarter
of
2012
were
$121.8 billion
, as compared to
$124.6 billion
in the prior quarter and
$117.5 billion
last year. The sequential quarter decline of
$2.7 billion
was attributable to the aforementioned sales, or transfers to loans held for sale, during the
third quarter
of
2012
of:
6
These declines were partially offset by growth in commercial and industrial loans and consumer direct and indirect loans. The
$4.3 billion
of period end loan growth as compared to the prior year was attributable to the same factors as noted in the average balance comparisons above.
Securities Available for Sale
As of
September 30
,
2012
, the Company's securities available for sale portfolio was
$21.5 billion
, down
$2.9 billion
, or
12%
, from
June 30, 2012
and
$6.0 billion
, or
22%
, from
September 30, 2011
. The sequential quarter decline was primarily related to the sale of the KO shares in September. Additionally, the Company's holdings of mortgage backed securities declined during the quarter as a result of the repayment of principal. The decline from
September 30, 2011
was for the same reasons noted above along with the repositioning of the investment portfolio, which included selling certain low coupon agency mortgage-backed securities. The yield on the securities portfolio declined 38 basis points sequentially, from 3.16% in the prior quarter to 2.78% in the third quarter of 2012; approximately 30 basis points of the decline was due to the forgone dividend income associated with the KO transaction.
Deposits
Average consumer and commercial deposits for the
third quarter
of
2012
were
$125.4 billion
compared to
$125.9 billion
and
$123.0 billion
for the
second quarter
of
2012
and
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower cost accounts continued during the quarter, with a
$1.2 billion
, or
3%
, increase in demand deposits. However, this was offset by a
$1.2 billion
, or
7%
, decline in time deposits and a
$433 million
, or
1%
, decline in money market accounts.
Compared to the
third quarter
of
2011
, average consumer and commercial deposits increased
$2.4 billion
, or
2%
. Average demand deposits increased
$5.9 billion
, or
19%
, interest bearing transaction accounts increased
$0.8 billion
, or
3%
, and savings accounts increased
$0.6 billion
, or
12%
. Time deposits declined
$3.4 billion
, or
17%
, and money market accounts declined
$1.6 billion
, or
4%
.
Capital and Liquidity
The Companys estimated capital ratios are well above current regulatory requirements with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios increasing to an estimated
10.60%
and
9.80%
, respectively. The ratios of total average equity to total average assets and tangible equity to tangible assets were
11.76
% and
8.48
%, respectively, as of
September 30
,
2012
. The Company continues to have substantial available liquidity provided in the form of its client deposit base and other available funding resources, as well as its portfolio of cash and high-quality government-backed securities.
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter, with declines in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets. Nonperforming loans totaled
$1.7 billion
as of
September 30
,
2012
, down
$727 million
, or
30
%, relative to the prior quarter. The primary driver of the decline in nonperforming loans was the sale of certain mortgage and commercial real estate loans. Specifically, the Company transferred $544 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale during the
third quarter
. The majority of the loans were sold during the quarter, and as of
September 30
,
2012
,
$40 million
of nonperforming loans remain classified as held for sale. Partially offsetting this decline in nonperforming loans was an $81 million increase in nonperforming junior lien loans that were current but subordinate to a first lien loan that was seriously delinquent. The decision to transfer these current junior liens to nonperforming loans was driven by regulatory guidance issued during 2012.
Compared to
September 30
,
2011
, nonperforming loans declined
$1.5 billion
, or
47
%, with declines across all loan categories, most significantly in commercial real estate and residential loans. At the end of the
third quarter
of
2012
, the percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans was
1.42%
, down from
1.97%
and
2.76%
at the end of the
second quarter
of
2012
and
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively. Other real estate owned totaled
$304 million
at the end of the current quarter, down
8%
on a sequential quarter basis and down
40
% since
September 30
,
2011
.
7
Net charge-offs were
$511 million
in the current quarter compared to
$350 million
for the prior quarter and
$492 million
for the
third quarter
of
2011
. The sequential quarter increase of
$161 million
was largely driven by $172 million in charge-offs associated with the aforementioned sales of nonperforming loans. Additionally, during the third quarter the Company elected to revise its credit policy related to the timing of recognizing charge-offs on junior lien loans. The Company previously charged-off junior lien loans at 180 days past due. However, with the newly implemented credit policy change, the Company is recognizing the charge-off at 120 days past due, as its analysis indicated that when junior lien loans become 120 days past due the vast majority ultimately experience a charge-off. The change in credit policy resulted in $65 million of incremental charge-offs. Excluding the impacts from the nonperforming loan sales and the junior lien credit policy change, current quarter net charge-offs were $274 million, a decline of $76 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower losses across several loan categories, as well as a
$27 million
increase in recoveries from the prior quarter. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to total average loans was
1.64%
for the current quarter, with the charge-offs resulting from the sales of nonperforming loans and the credit policy change adding 76 basis points to the ratio. The provision for credit losses was
$450 million
, an increase of
$150 million
and
$103 million
from the prior quarter and the
third quarter
of
2011
, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by incremental charge-offs associated with the sales of nonperforming loans and the junior lien credit policy change.
As of
September 30
,
2012
, the allowance for loan losses was
$2.2 billion
and represented
1.84
% of total loans, down
1
basis point from
June 30
,
2012
. The
$61 million
decline in the allowance for loan losses during the
third quarter
of
2012
was reflective of the continued improvement in asset quality.
Early stage delinquencies decreased two basis points from the end of the
second quarter
of
2012
to 0.95%. The decline was primarily due to the sale of government guaranteed loans. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, early stage delinquencies were 0.53%, an increase of two basis points from
June 30
,
2012
.
Accruing restructured loans totaled
$2.6 billion
, and nonaccruing restructured loans totaled
$0.5 billion
as of
September 30

Item 1A. Risk Factors
 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and in other periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Those factors include: as one of the largest lenders in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S. and a provider of financial products and services to consumers and businesses across the U.S., our financial results have been, and may continue to be, materially affected by general economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and home prices in the U.S., and a deterioration of economic conditions or of the financial markets may materially adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and condition; legislation and regulation, including the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as future legislation and/or regulation, could require us to change certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive position; we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and, if we fail to meet these guidelines, our financial condition would be adversely affected; loss of customer deposits and market illiquidity could increase our funding costs; we rely on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of our liquidity; we are subject to credit risk; our ALLL may not be adequate to
9
cover our eventual losses; we may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral; we will realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of nonperforming assets are less than the carrying value of such assets; a downgrade in the U.S. government's sovereign credit rating, or in the credit ratings of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict; the failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the U.S.; weakness in the real estate market, including the secondary residential mortgage loan markets, has adversely affected us and may continue to adversely affect us; we are subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages, and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or as a result of certain breaches of our servicing agreements, and this could harm our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition; financial difficulties or credit downgrades of mortgage and bond insurers may adversely affect our servicing and investment portfolios; we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions; we are subject to risks related to delays in the foreclosure process; we may continue to suffer increased losses in our loan portfolio despite enhancement of our underwriting policies and practices; our mortgage production and servicing revenue can be volatile; as a financial services company, adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our MSRs and mortgages held for sale, reducing our earnings; the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings; depressed market values for our stock may require us to write down goodwill; clients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could affect net income; we have businesses other than banking which subject us to a variety of risks; hurricanes and other disasters may adversely affect loan portfolios and operations and increase the cost of doing business; negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact business and revenues; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses; we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure; the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us; we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties; regulation by federal and state agencies could adversely affect the business, revenue, and profit margins; competition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or margin declines; maintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services; we might not pay dividends on your common stock; our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends; disruptions in our ability to access global capital markets may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity; any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets; we have in the past and may in the future pursue acquisitions, which could affect costs and from which we may not be able to realize anticipated benefits; we are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results; we may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even from inadvertent or unintentional violations; we depend on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer; we may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of turnover, both of which may increase costs and reduce profitability and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategies; our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain; changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition; our stock price can be volatile; our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us; our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud; our financial instruments carried
10
at fair value expose us to certain market risks; our revenues derived from our investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks; and we may enter into transactions with off-balance sheet affiliates or our subsidiaries.

The fully taxable-equivalent(FTE) basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.

The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income - FTE by average total earning assets.

Certain amounts in this schedule are presented net of applicable income taxes, which are calculated based on each subsidiarys federal and state tax rates and laws. In general, the federal marginal tax rate is 35%, but the state marginal tax rates range from 1% to 8% in accordance with the subsidiarys income tax filing requirements with various tax authorities. In addition, the effective tax rate may differ from the federal and state marginal tax rates in certain cases where a permanent difference exists.

Computed by dividing noninterest expense by total revenue - FTE. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.
3
SunTrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio which excludes the amortization of intangible assets other than MSRs. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of these intangible asset costs (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys efficiency to other companies in the industry. This measure is utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the Company and its lines of business.
4
SunTrust presents a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. This measure is used by management to analyze capital adequacy.
5
SunTrust presents a tangible book value per common share that excludes the after-tax impact of purchase accounting intangible assets and also excludes preferred stock from tangible equity. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because, by removing the effect of intangible assets that result from merger and acquisition activity as well as preferred stock (the level of which may vary from company to company), it allows investors to more easily compare the Companys book value on common stock to other companies in the industry.
6
SunTrust presents total revenue - FTE excluding net securities gains. The Company believes noninterest income without net securities gains is more indicative of the Companys performance because it isolates income that is primarily client relationship and client transaction driven and is more indicative of normalized operations.
7
SunTrust presents a ratio of allowance to total loans, excluding government guaranteed and fair value loans, to exclude loans from the calculation that are held at fair value with no related allowance and loans guaranteed by a government agency that do not have an associated allowance recorded due to nominal risk of principal loss.

30 Reconciliation of Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio1 ($ in billions) 3Q 12 Tier 1 Common Equity - Basel I $13.2 Adjustments from Basel I to Proposed Basel III 2 ($0.2) Tier 1 Common Equity - Proposed Basel III 3 $13.0 Risk-weighted Assets - Basel I $133.9 Adjustments from Basel I to Proposed Basel III 4 30.7 Risk-weighted Assets - Proposed Basel III $164.6 Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio Basel I 9.8% Proposed Basel III 3 7.9% 1. The Tier 1 common equity ratio is a financial measure that is used by regulators, bank management, and investors to assess the capital position of financial services companies. The Tier 1 ratio as calculated for Basel III under the recent notice of proposed rule making is considered non-GAAP, and as such we have presented a reconciliation to the Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I that is currently used by regulators. All figures are estimated at the time of the earnings release and subject to revision 2. Primarily relates to the impacts of unrealized AFS gains and accrued pension liabilities 3. The proposed Basel III calculations of Tier 1 common equity, risk-weighted assets, and the Tier 1 common ratio are based upon the Company's interpretation of the notice of proposed rule making issued by the Federal Reserve in June 2012. The final Basel III ruling by the Federal Reserve is subject to potential changes from the proposed rulemaking, as is the Company's interpretation of the rules 4. The largest differences between the risk-weighted assets as calculated under Basel I and the Basel III proposal for SunTrust relate to the risk-weightings for mortgage, home equity, and CRE loans NOTE: Totals may not foot due to rounding
