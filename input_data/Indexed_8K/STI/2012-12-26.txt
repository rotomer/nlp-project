SUNTRUST BANKS, INC. 401(k) PLAN
INTRODUCTION
SunTrust Banks, Inc. is the parent corporation in a controlled group that currently includes various subsidiaries and affiliated companies. SunTrust Banks, Inc. is sometimes referred to as the Company and/or the Plan sponsor. The Company and its controlled group members that adopt the Plan are referred to as Employers. SunTrust Banks, Inc. was formed as of July 1, 1985, with the merger of Sun Banks, Inc. and Trust Company Bank (successor to Trust Company of Georgia). The qualified defined contribution plans maintained by each company were merged to form the SunTrust Banks, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan), effective as of January 1, 1989. The Plan was renamed the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 401(k) Plan effective January 1, 1993.
The plans that were merged to form this Plan include the following: (1) the Sun Banks, Inc. SunShare Plan, effective July 1, 1984; (2) the Trust Company of Georgia Incentive Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 1987
;
(3) the Third National Corporation Thrift Plan, effective January 1, 1987; and (4) the Trust Company of Georgia Tax-Credit Employee Stock Ownership Plan, effective January 1, 1985. This merged Plan was previously amended and restated effective as of January 1, 1990, January 1, 1993, January 1, 1997, January 1, 2002, January 1, 2006, April 22, 2009 and January 1, 2010 (reflecting amendments through December 31, 2010).
Although the Plan is named as a 401(k) Plan and includes a cash-or-deferred arrangement under Sections 401(k) and (m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), before 2007 the Plan was always an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) under Code Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) and was designed to invest primarily in employer stock. As an ESOP, the Plan was, in fact, always invested primarily in employer stock. Effective January 1, 2007, the Plan was converted to a Code Section 401(k) Plan with an Employer Stock Fund that constitutes an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) within the Plan.
Effective January 1, 2002, the Plan was converted to a design-based safe harbor plan that satisfies the ADP safe-harbor requirements set forth in Code Section 401(k)(12) with respect to
elective deferrals, and the ACP safe-harbor requirements set forth in Code Section 401(m)(11) with respect to matching contributions. As a safe harbor plan, the Plan is exempt from nondiscrimination testing and from the top-heavy rules. The ESOP portion of the Plan continues to be designed to invest primarily in Employer Stock. The primary purpose of the ESOP is to provide participants with beneficial ownership of Employer Stock. A secondary purpose of the ESOP is to serve as a potential means of corporate finance. The Company may use the ESOP
to meet its general financing requirements, including capital growth and transfers in the ownership of Employer Stock. The Plan may receive loans and other extensions of credit to finance the acquisition of Employer Stock.
During 2001 and effective January 1, 2002, the Plan was amended and restated to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, the Small Business Jobs Protection Act a/k/a the Pension Simplification Act of 1996, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, and the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (effective January 1, 1999), and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, as of the effective dates stated in various Sections in the Plan that are affected by these amendments.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Plan was restated to incorporate all amendments adopted after December 31, 2001, including amendments that first became effective as of January 1, 2006.
Effective January 1, 2007, the Plan was amended to convert the Plan from an ESOP to a Code Section 401(k) Plan with an Employer Stock Fund that constitutes an ESOP, to bring the Plan into compliance with applicable requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA), and to document provisions to assist participants affected by Hurricane Katrina.
The Plan subsequently was amended to adopt automatic enrollment for all eligible employees who begin employment after March 31, 2007; to comply with the PPA requirements for qualified default investment alternatives under ERISA Section 404(c), to increase Employer matching contributions to 100% of the first 5% of compensation deferred effective January 1, 2008; to bring the Code Section 415 provisions into compliance with Final Treasury Regulations effective January 1, 2008; and to provide for the investment of matching contributions according to participant elections for their own deferrals effective January 1, 2009. Effective April 1, 2007,
the Plan satisfies both the traditional safe harbor requirements under Code Section 401(k)(12), and the safe harbor requirements for Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangements (QACAs) under Code Section 401(k)(13). Effective January 1, 2011, the Plan will implement a two-year vesting schedule for eligible employees whose employment begin after December 31, 2010 and will satisfy only the safe harbor requirements for a QACA under Code Section 401(a)(13).
 
Effective April 22, 2009, the Plan was restated to incorporate all amendments adopted after December 31, 2005. The Plan subsequently was amended to clarify the definition of
compensation
for purposes of deferrals, the Code Section 415 limitations, and the definition of
highly compensated employee;
to comply with the HEART Act and certain PPA provisions; to clarify the distribution rules and the rollover rules; and provide for the suspension of required minimum distributions during 2009. Those amendments were incorporated into the January 1, 2010 restatement that was submitted to the Internal Revenue Service with the Companys request for an updated determination letter.
The January 1, 2010 amendment and restatement also incorporated provisions for Designated Roth Contributions, which provisions were effective January 1, 2011.
The Plan was amended in 2011: (1) to revise the Committee structure, effective July 1, 2011,
by establishing
two fiduciary committees as follows: the Benefits Plan Committee, chaired by the Chief Human Resources Officer, responsible for the administration and operation of the Plan and the Benefits Finance Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, responsible for all financial decisions including actuarial assumptions for plan valuations and plan investments; (2) to permit the Employer to make discretionary contributions to the Plan to be determined annually (3) to increase Employer matching contributions to 100% of the first 6% of compensation deferred each effective January 1, 2012 and (4) to provide for a special one-time contribution for certain eligible Participants effective December 31, 2011.
The Plan was amended in 2012, effective January 1, 2013, to limit Participants election to have his/her Employee Contributions and Employer Contributions invested in the Employer Stock Fund to 10% of such Contributions.
This January 1, 2012 amendment and restatement incorporates the 2011 and the 2012 amendments and such other amendments as necessary for the administration and operation of the Plan.
Addendum A sets forth provisions that have been in effect for previous periods of the Plans history. Special provisions that affect the benefits of Participants who work or worked for acquired or merged entities are described in Addendum B. A listing of the adopting Employers is set forth in Addendum C. The Addenda are integral parts of the Plan.
The rights of all employees who terminated employment with any Employer before the effective dates of the various provisions in this amendment and restatement, and their beneficiaries, will be governed by the Plan as in effect on the employee's termination date, except that account balances of terminated Participants will be administered and distributed in compliance with Plan provisions and applicable law as in effect from time to time. Eligible employees who are in active employment on or after the effective dates of the various provisions in this restatement will be entitled to participate in the Plan and receive benefits payable under the Plan as amended and restated and as further amended from time to time. The Plan fiduciaries will administer the Plan in accordance with applicable laws enacted from time to time, and will implement operational compliance between the effective dates of such laws and the corollary Plan amendment dates.

The amount of his/her special Employee Contributions will be based on the Compensation he/she would have received if he/she had remained in active Employment, at his/her rate of pay in effect when he/she began his/her leave. If that pay rate cannot be determined with certainty, the Committee will treat him/her as having Compensation equal to the amount he/she received during the 12-month period preceding his/her leave, or during the entire period of his/her Employment if shorter than 12 months.

If an eligible Employee is credited with an Employer Discretionary Contribution but does not otherwise have an Account under the Plan, the eligible Employee may make an election to have any Employer Discretionary Contributions invested in one or more available investment options. For an eligible Employee who does not have an investment election in effect, the Plan will invest his/her Employer Discretionary Contributions in a QDIA fund.
Employee Contributions described in Section 3.1. The Employers will make a special Employer Discretionary Contribution for each eligible Employee who returns to Employment from unpaid Qualified Military Leave for any Plan Year the Employers made an Employer Discretionary Contribution while such eligible Employee was on unpaid Qualified Military Leave. The Compensation used to determine the Employer Discretionary Contribution will be calculated in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.1(e). Each Matching Contribution relates to the Plan Year for which the make-up Employee Contribution is made and each Employer Discretionary Contribution relates to the Plan Year the Employer Discretionary Contribution was originally made and are subject to the percentage-of-Compensation limit and Code Sections 402(g) and 415 limits in effect for that Plan Year.

Upon approval by the Committee, the Rollover Contributions will be deposited in the Trust Fund and will be credited to the Employees Rollover Account.

ALLOCATIONS
Employer Stock acquired with an Acquisition Loan and held in a Suspense Account, to repay any outstanding balance on that Acquisition Loan. Effective January 1, 2002, the Plan will maximize the Companys tax deductions available under Code Section 404(k) by permitting Participants and beneficiaries to elect whether to receive the dividends declared on the Share Units allocated to the portion of their Accounts that

invested in the Employer Stock Fund in a cash payment to be made no later than 90 days after the end of the Plan Year in which the dividends were paid, or to reinvest them in the Employer Stock Fund. The Plan will provide the elections in a manner that permits Participants and beneficiaries reasonable time to make their elections with respect to each dividend declaration. The Plan will honor each Participants and beneficiarys election as in effect on the record date for that dividend. The elections for each quarterly dividend become irrevocable on the record date for the dividend, unless the Committee has timely established and communicated a different irrevocability date. The Plan treats elections as evergreen so that each election remains in effect until a Participant or beneficiary affirmatively elects to change it. Participants and beneficiaries may change their dividend elections at any time for dividends to be declared after the submission date of the change request. The Plan treats any Participant or beneficiary who fails to make an affirmative election as if he/she had elected to reinvest his/her dividends in the Employer Stock Fund. The Plan will not distribute any earnings on any dividends that are reinvested in Employer Stock and subsequently distributed pursuant to an election under this Section. Beginning in 2003, the Plan will decrease elected cash distributions to reflect any losses attributable to the dividend between the record date and the distribution date.

The Trustee will refrain from tendering the shares of Employer Stock represented by Share Units held in the Accounts of Participants who fail to give directions, except as required by any applicable law. The Trustee will tender unallocated shares of Employer Stock in the Suspense Account in the manner that the Trustee determines to be in the best interest of Participants and beneficiaries. For each Participant who sells the Share Units held in his/her Accounts, the Trustee will reinvest the proceeds according to his/her current investment election, unless he/she elects otherwise under Subsection 4.2(e). For purposes of any tender offer, each Participant will be a named fiduciary with respect to the Employer Stock represented by the Share Units held in his/her own Accounts.

It is not necessary for the transferee plan to protect benefits that were provided in the transferor plan, i.e., the Code Section 411(d)(6) anti-cutback rules do not apply.

ADDENDUM A
HISTORY OF REVISED PLAN PROVISIONS
The following provisions are records of the Plans relevant history. These provisions have the same Section headings and numbers as the corollary Sections in the main text of the Plan, with the prefix A- to correspond to this Addendum A. Certain provisions explain historical events. Others explain rules that were in effect during the stated periods of the Plan's existence but have been revised as set forth in the corollary Sections of the main text of the Plan. Although revised, these historical provisions may continue to affect the amount of and/or entitlement to benefits of a Participant or beneficiary whose benefits are determined after the dates when these provisions were changed, particularly those Participants who terminated before the effective date of one or more revisions.

(A)    
Plan Years 1984 - 2004
. From July 1, 1984 through December 31, 2004, the Plan automatically invested Matching Contributions in the Employer Stock Fund. From January 1, 1987 (the effective date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986) through June 30, 1997, the Plan permitted Participants to elect to diversify up to 50% their Matching Contribution in the Employer Stock Fund beginning the first day of the month in which they reached age 55. From July 1, 1997 through December 31, 2004, the Plan , the Plan permitted Participants to elect to diversify up to
    
100% of their Matching Contribution in the Employer Stock Fund beginning the first day of the month in which they reached age 55.
(E)    
True-up Matching Contributions for the 2008 Plan Year,
made under Subsection 3.2(b), were invested in the Employer Stock Fund (with full and immediate diversification rights). Effective January 1, 2009, True-Up Contributions are invested according to the Participants election in effect on the allocation date.

ARTICLE 3
Contributions
A-3.1    
Employee Elective Contributions and Catch-Up Contributions
.
(a)     
Amount Permitted.
The Plan requires Participants to make their Elective Contributions in whole percentages. For Plan Years 1984 through 1996, the Plan permitted Participants to make Elective Contributions between 2% and 6% of Compensation for each payroll period. For Plan Years 1997 through 1999, the Plan permitted Participants to make Elective Contributions between 2% and 10%. For Plan Years 2000 through 2002, the Plan permitted Participants to make Elective Contributions between 1% and 15%. For Plan Years 2003 through 2010, the Plan permitted Participants to make Elective Contributions between 1% and 20%. Effective January 1, 2011, the Plan permits Participants to make Elective Contributions and/or Roth Contributions between 1% and 50% for each payroll period.
. . .
 
    
when the Committee considered it appropriate to facilitate administration, if a Participant was eligible to make Catch-Up Contributions and entered or re-entered the Plan mid-year, the Plan pro-rated the limit in effect for that Plan Year, to equal the ratio of his/her months of participation over 12 multiplied by the annual limit. For Plan Years 2002 through 2010, the Plan permitted Participants to make Catch-Up Contributions between 1% and 55%. Effective January 1, 2011, the Plan permits Participants to make Catch-Up Contributions between 1% and 25%.
During the first month of the 2000 Plan Year, the recordkeeper inadvertently allocated a Matching Contribution in a manner that overstated the amounts in the Employer Contribution Accounts invested in Employer Stock. As soon as practicable after the Committee discovered the overstatement, it directed the recordkeeper to correct the balances of Participants who had not received distributions. For Participants who had received distributions, which the Committee determined to be a nondiscriminatory group, the Company made a special Matching Contribution in the amount necessary to reconcile the distributed Account balances with the Trust Fund. The
    
Committee determined, within its discretion reserved in Subsection 4.1(f), that the cost of attempting to recover the overstated amounts exceeded the amounts involved, and that the special Matching Contribution was the more reasonable method to achieve reconciliation.

Hurricane Relief.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee was permitted to implement applicable provisions of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (KETRA), the Gulf Zone Opportunity Act of 2005 (GOZA), and IRS Announcement 2005-70, for any Participant, Spouse, qualifying child or qualifying relative whose hardship arose from Hurricane Katrina between August 29, 2005 and March 31, 2006, or from Hurricane Wilma between October 23, 2005 and February 28, 2006, and who had their principal residence or place of employment in an area covered by KETRA or GOZA. Each Participant whose need arose from any such Hurricane is an Affected Participant. The Committee was permitted to treat the need arising from any such Hurricane as a safe-harbor reason for a hardship withdrawal. The Committee was permitted to waive the six-months deferral suspension for Affected Participants, and the requirement for any documentation that was not available because of the Hurricane.

Hurricane Relief.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee implemented applicable provisions of the Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 (KETRA), the Gulf Zone Opportunity Act of 2005 (GOZA), and IRS Announcement 2005-70, for any Participant whose need for a loan arose from economic losses in Hurricane Katrina between August 29, 2005 and March 31, 2006, or from Hurricane Rita on September 23, 2005, or from Hurricane Wilma on October 23, 2005, and who had their principal residence or place of employment in an area covered by KETRA or GOZA. Each such Participant is an Affected Participant. The loan limits were increased to the lesser of 100% of the Affected Participants Account balances or $100,000. The Committee was permitted to delay loan repayments due between the Hurricane date and December 31, 2006, for one year, with the continued accrual of interest, and to adjust subsequent repayments to reflect the delay and the accrued interest. The Committee is permitted to disregard the period of delay in determining the maximum five-year loan repayment period.

(c)    
Annuities
. Before April 1, 2002, the Plan provided annuity forms of payment to certain acquired or merged entities listed in Addendum B, which forms were grandfathered from predecessor plans that merged into this Plan. During 2001, the Plan provided a 90-day notice to all affected Participants that, effective April 1, 2002, the Plan no longer offers annuity forms of payment. However, with respect to Money Purchase Accounts, the Plan continues to provide the single life annuity as the normal form for unmarried Participants, and the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity as the normal form for married Participants.
    
    
    
ARTICLE 7
Limitations on Contributions
(b)    
Correction of Excess Annual Additions.
Before January 1, 2008, the Committee removed from each Participants Accounts any allocations that would cause his/her Annual Addition for any Plan Year to exceed his/her Maximum Annual Addition, if the excess resulted from a reasonable error in estimating his/her annual Compensation, or in determining the amount of Elective Contributions that he/she could make under the Dollar Limit described in Section 7.1, or under other circumstances that the Internal Revenue Service permitted. The Committee first refunded unmatched Employee Contributions, and then matched Employee Contributions, with attributable earnings. The Committee then removed the Matching Contributions attributable to each refund to a suspense account. The Committee reallocated the amount in the suspense account to all Participants as part of their Matching Contribution for the same or the next Plan Year. Beginning January 1, 2008, the Committee corrects any Excess Annual Addition by using correction methods prescribed by the IRS.

Spousal consent is required for loans and for post-Employment distribution in a form other than the normal form. Spousal consent to a form of payment other than the normal form is not valid unless given within 90 days before the Benefit Commencement Date. The normal form of payment for each Money Purchase Account is the single life annuity for the unmarried Participant, and the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity for the married Participant. If a Participant dies with a Money Purchase Account balance, and before his/her Benefit Commencement Date, the Plan will pay the balance in that Account to his/her surviving Spouse in the form of a 50 percent qualified preretirement survivor annuity unless the Spouse elects another form.

QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER PROCEDURES

SUNTRUST BANKC, INC.
401(k) PLAN
ADDENDUM A
QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER PROCEDURES
As provided in Section 10.4, the Plan will make distributions in accordance with a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) issued in accordance with Code Section 414(p) and ERISA Section 206(d)(3). Those statutes govern the payment of benefits earned by a Participant under the Plan to his/her Spouse, former Spouse, child(ren) or other dependents, to the extent awarded under a QDRO. The relevant provisions of the Code and ERISA are nearly identical. Each Spouse, former Spouse, child or other dependent who is entitled to benefits under a QDRO is called an Alternate Payee. The Code requires the Plan to provide the following procedures to assist eligible individuals and their representatives to obtain a QDRO from a state domestic relations court or agency under the state's domestic relations laws.
The order must constitute a judgment, decree or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) made pursuant to a state domestic relations law (including community property law) that relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments or marital property rights to a Spouse, former Spouse, child or other dependent of a Participant (Alternate Payee).
Statutory Alternate Payee Group. The Plan will not honor any provision in a QDRO that names a contingent Alternate Payee to receive the awarded amount if the Alternate Payee dies before the Plan distributes the awarded amount, other than an individual who is within the Statutory Alternate Payee Group. The only person whom a QDRO may require to be treated as a Spouse is a former or current Spouse to whom the Participant is or was legally married. The Alternate Payee has the legal status of a beneficiary under the Plan. The Plan will honor a QDRO provision that names one or more contingent Alternate Payees who are within the Statutory Alternate Payee Group, to receive the awarded amount if the Alternate Payee dies before the Plan distributes the awarded amount. The Plan will honor a QDRO provision that names more than one of the Participant's dependents and specifies the order of succession. For example, if the Alternate Payee is a former Spouse who dies before receiving the award, the QDRO might provide that the Participant's children will receive the awarded amount in equal shares, or if no child survives, the Participants other dependent(s), if any, will receive the awarded amount. The Plan will not treat the spouse of any Alternate Payee who is not a Participant in his/her own right, as a Spouse for any purpose under the Plan.
(b)    
Shared Payment Award
. A shared-payment award gives the Alternate Payee a right to receive a stated dollar amount or percentage of the amount actually distributed to the Participant. If the QDRO awards the Alternate Payee a share of the amount to be distributed to the Participant in the future, the Plan will not make any payment under the QDRO until the Participants distribution date. The QDRO may specify a date or event as of which the award to the Alternate Payee will cease to be effective, e.g., the date the Alternate Payee remarries, or reaches the age of majority, or dies, etc.
  
 
(including a property settlement agreement) or other notice that a QDRO is being sought, and will provide a copy of this Addendum D and information about the Plan that is sufficient to permit the parties and/or their representatives to design and obtain a QDRO that complies with this Addendum and all other relevant provisions of the Plan. To the extent any court or agency with jurisdiction rules that a QDRO is inconsistent with this Addendum D, this Addendum will prevail and will govern the distribution that is made pursuant to the QDRO, which distribution will be consistent with this Addendum D.
Within a reasonable period after receiving the order, but no later than 18 months after the payment date specified in the order (see explanation of the 18month period in Section 8), the Committee will determine whether the proposed order is qualified and will notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of the determination. The parties may designate representatives to receive the notices.
The Code and ERISA require a protection period of 18 months beginning on the date when the QDRO award will be payable if the proposed order should be approved. If the
Committee has provided the Alternate Payee with a written determination and explanation of defects in a proposed QDRO, and the defects are not corrected by the end of the 18-month protection period, the Plan may then pay to the Participant (or beneficiary) the entire benefit to which he/she would have been entitled if the proposed order had not been submitted (if the Participant is otherwise eligible for distribution). If the Committee determines, after the end of the 18-month period, that a revised order is qualified, the Plan will pay the QDRO award prospectively only, with no retroactive payment of interest. The QDRO may provide that the determination date is the calculation date. In situations where the award would be immediately payable if the order were immediately approved, the 18-month protection period begins to run on the date when the Committee receives the initial proposed QDRO. But in situations where the award would not be payable until a future date (for example, the Participants Termination Date), the 18-month period begins to run on the first date when the Alternate Payee could receive the distribution if he/ she elected to do so.

SunTrust Banks, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
Amended and Restated
Effective
January 1, 2012
Including Amendments through December 31, 2012
ARTICLE 1
Establishment and Purpose
The SunTrust Banks, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan is hereby amended and restated effective January 1, 2012 (the Plan), and except as otherwise specifically noted, continues to provide a nonqualified and unfunded deferred compensation program to Eligible Employees pursuant to the terms and provisions set forth below, as subsequently amended from time to time. The Plan was amended in 2011 and 2012 to provide for additional Company Contributions. This January 1, 2012 amendment and restatement incorporates the 2011 and 2012 amendments and such other amendments as necessary for the administration and operation of the Plan.
In addition, the Plan was previously amended and restated effective January 1, 2010 to reflect authorized design changes in connection with the December 31, 2009 merger of the SunTrust Banks, Inc. 401(k) Excess Plan (the 401(k) Excess Plan) and the prior SunTrust Banks, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan), which were both previously amended and restated effective January 1, 2009 for compliance with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
SunTrust Banks, Inc. (SunTrust) originally established the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan effective October 1, 1999, by combining and restating the SunTrust Management Incentive Plan Deferred Compensation Plan Fund (the MIP Fund) and the SunTrust Performance Unit Plan Deferred Compensation Plan (the PUP Fund). All accounts in the MIP Fund and PUP Fund existing as of September 30, 1999 became subject to the terms of the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan. The Prior Deferred Compensation Plan was established to provide a single deferred compensation plan as the means whereby participants in the SunTrust Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and the SunTrust Performance Unit Plan (PUP) could defer receipt of all or a portion of their MIP awards and PUP awards as well as future awards provided by certain select bonus and incentive programs.
1
SunTrust established the 401(k) Excess Plan to provide benefits to certain highly compensated employees that were not otherwise allowed under SunTrusts qualified 401(k) plan due to the limitations of Code sections 401(a)(17), 402(g) and 415(c). Effective July 1, 1999, the Crestar Additional Nonqualified Executive Plan (the ANEX Plan), a deferral plan similar to the 401(k) Excess Plan, was merged into the 401(k) Excess Plan and the existing account balances attributable to both the 401(k) Excess Plan and the ANEX Plan as of June 30, 1999, were frozen as to future contributions and renamed the Excess Plan Frozen Balance and the ANEX Frozen Balance, respectively.
The terms of the Plan, as set forth herein, shall govern the deferral and distribution of Eligible Income (as defined below) earned after 2009 with respect to services performed on and after January 1, 2010. In addition, the distribution of all amounts earned prior to 2010 and deferred under the 401(k) Excess Plan or the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan, including the benefits under the prior plans as described above, shall be made in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) Excess Plan and the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan as in effect immediately prior to the merger of these two plans on December 31, 2009, including any grandfathered amounts
that were earned and vested (within the meaning of Code section 409A and regulations thereunder) under each plan prior to 2005 (and earnings thereon) (the Grandfathered Amounts). Benefits earned under the 401(k) Excess Plan and the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan prior to 2010 have been maintained in separate accounts. As provided by the Plan Administrator, all amounts credited under the Plan, including amounts credited under the 401(k) Excess Plan and the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan prior to 2010, shall be subject to the investment provisions set forth in Article 4. The relevant terms of the 401(k) Excess Plan and the Prior Deferred Compensation Plan, including the provisions relating to the Grandfathered Amounts, on December 31, 2009 are summarized in Addenda A and B, respectively.
The Plan is intended (1) to comply with Code section 409A and official guidance issued thereunder (except with respect to any Grandfathered Amounts), (2) to be a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees within the meaning of sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, and (3) to comply with
certain other regulatory requirements imposed upon SunTrust and its Affiliates, as described in Section 9.12.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions.
