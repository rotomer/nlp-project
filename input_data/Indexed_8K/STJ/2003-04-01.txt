The Company paid 26.9 billion Yen to acquire 100% of the common stock of Getz, which has approximately 400 employees. The Company predicts that the acquisition will be neutral to earnings per share in 2003 and accretive in 2004 and thereafter. As part of the financing for the acquisition the Company obtained an unsecured loan for 24.6 billion Yen. Separately, the Company has acquired the assets from Getz Bros. & Co. (Aust) Pty. Limited and Medtel Pty. Limited related to the distribution of the Company's products in Australia. Under this transaction the Company now employs approximately 30 additional sales and support employees in Australia and directly distributes all of its products in Australia. The prediction regarding the impact of the Getz Japan acquisition on earnings per share is a forward looking statement which is subject to risks and uncertainties, such as items described in the Financial Section of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002 (see pages 6 - 8 of the Financial Report). Actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.
