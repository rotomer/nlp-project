The previously disclosed acquisition of St. Jude Medical's largest distributor in Japan, Getz Bros., closed on April 1, 2003. The Company anticipates absorbing the higher cost of goods sold associated with the Getz acquisition accounting in the second quarter of 2003. Including the
absorption of this higher cost of goods sold, the Company expects consolidated EPS for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.41 - $0.43. For the second half of 2003, the higher cost of goods sold arising from the acquisition of Getz will moderate. For the full year 2003, the Company expects this acquisition will be neutral to EPS. The Company expects consolidated EPS for the full year 2003 to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80. All of the above sales and EPS expectations assume the Euro/U.S. dollar and Yen/U.S. dollar exchange rates remain at current levels where each Euro translates into $1.06 U.S. dollar and every 120 Yen translates into $1.00 U.S. dollar." Any statements made regarding the Company's anticipated product approvals, sales, expenses and earnings are forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties, such as those described in the Financial Report section of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 (see pages 6-8). Actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.
