Item 8.01.  
Other Events.
On August 31, 2004, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) issued a ruling on Guidant's appeal of the trial court decision and jury verdict on the 288 patent controlled by Guidant.
The CAFC reversed the decision of the trial court judge that the 288 patent was invalid.  The court also ruled that the trial judge's claim construction of the 288 patent was incorrect and, therefore, the jury's verdict of non-infringement was set aside.  The court also ruled on other issues that were raised by the parties.
The effect of the decision, if unappealed, will be to return the case to the trial judge for claim construction of a possible new trial on the issue of infringement and damages.
Guidant had sued St. Jude Medical in 1996 alleging that the company's implantable cardioverter-defibrillator products infringed the 288 and three other patents.  The other patents were dropped or dismissed from the litigation.
Guidant is claiming damages for ICD sales from May 15, 1997 through December 2003, when the 288 patent expired.
