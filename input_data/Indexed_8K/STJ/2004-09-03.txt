Other Events.
On September 2, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an order granting St. Jude Medical, Inc.'s Petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for Permission to Appeal a Class Certification Order.
In the Petition, St. Jude Medical sought permission to appeal from the July 15, 2004 class certification order of United States District Judge John R. Tunheim in the multi-district Silzone heart valve litigation.  The order had certified a nationwide class action for personal injury and medical monitoring claims under Minnesota's consumer protection statutes.  Judge Tunheim also certified a medical monitoring class based on specific states' tort laws.  
In granting the Petition, the Eighth Circuit agreed to allow St. Jude Medical to appeal from the July 15, 2004 order, but did not decide whether the classes were properly certified.  The Eighth Circuit will address that issue at a later date and after further briefing.  It may be eight to twelve months before the Eighth Circuit issues a decision on this matter.  St. Jude Medical's position is that proceeding with a class action is not appropriate under existing law.
In a separate ruling on September 2, 2004, the Eighth Circuit issued an order denying St. Jude Medical's request that the appellate court review a decision by Judge Tunheim which held that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted by the U.S. Food and Drug Act.  The Eighth Circuit's decision does not substantively address or disagree with St. Jude Medical's grounds for appeal of the preemption ruling, but rather merely determined that an appeal of the preemption ruling was not possible at this time.
