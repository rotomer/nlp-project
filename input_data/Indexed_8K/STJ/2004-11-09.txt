On November 9, 2004, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company") was served with a lawsuit captioned: Spring Partners, LLC on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated v. Graydon E. Beatty, James W. Bullock, Robert G. Hauser, M.D., Mark T. Wagner, Warren S. Watson, Richard D. Randall, Richard J. Nigon, Jean-Paul Peltier, Endocardial Solutions, Inc., and St. Judge [sic] Medical, Inc. This suit was filed in Ramsey County, Minnesota District Court. The Complaint seeks class action status and alleges that the directors and officers of Endocardial Solutions, Inc. ("ESI") will obtain benefits from the proposed acquisition by the Company which will not be shared equally with the public shareholders, that the directors of ESI breached their fiduciary duties, that the proxy statement for the acquisition (which has been filed with the SEC, but not yet mailed) fails to disclose certain details and that the Company aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duty. The Complaint seeks injunctive relief, recision, and damages and attorney's fees, expert's fees and costs together with interest.
The Company considers this suit to be without merit and intends to proceed to close the proposed acquisition of ESI as soon as possible.
