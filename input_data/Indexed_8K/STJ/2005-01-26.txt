Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $611 million, compared to $519 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, an increase of 18%. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased fourth quarter sales by about $17 million.
Net sales for 2004 were $2,294 million compared to $1,933 million in 2003, an increase of 19%. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased 2004 sales by about $73 million.
Reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $125 million or $.33 per diluted share compared to $92 million, or $.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003, adjusted for the Company's stock split that was effective on November 1, 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2004, St. Jude Medical recorded three non-recurring items. First, in connection with the acquisition of Irvine Biomedical, Inc, which was completed on October 7, 2004, the Company recorded a special charge of $9.1 million related to purchased in-process research and development. Second, the Company settled a patent infringement lawsuit with Edwards LifeSciences Corporation and recorded a pre-tax special charge of $5.5 million. Third, during the quarter, St. Jude Medical concluded tax audits resulting in a $14 million reversal of previously recorded income tax expense. Net earnings for the fourth quarter, excluding these non-recurring items, were $123 million or $.33 cents per diluted share, a $31 million or 34% increase over the $92 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Reported net earnings for 2004 were $410 million, or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $337 million, or $.91 cents per diluted share in 2003, an increase in earnings per diluted share of 21%. Reported net earnings for 2004 include pre-tax special charges totaling $35 million recorded in the third quarter for the discontinuation of the Company's Symmetry Bypass System Aortic Connector product line and the non-recurring items recorded in the fourth quarter, as previously described. Net earnings for 2004, excluding these non-recurring items, were $430 million or $1.16 per share, a $93 million or 28% increase over the $337 reported in 2003.
St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, "2004 was a year of outstanding sales and earnings growth for St. Jude Medical. Sales increased 18% in the fourth quarter and 19% for the full year. Excluding non-recurring items, EPS increased 32% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. The Company continued to improve gross margins and expand investment in R&D."
Fourth quarter 2004 ICD product sales of $173 million increased 63% over the comparable quarter of 2003. ICD product sales for the full year 2004 were approximately $584 million, representing a 41% increase over 2003. The fourth quarter and year to date ICD product sales include sales of left-heart pacing leads of $7 million and $13 million, respectively. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, sales of left-heart pacing leads were included in pacemaker sales.
"The most significant event for the Company in 2004 was the launch of our high-voltage cardiac resynchronization products to treat heart failure in the U.S. We now have two full quarters experience in the U.S. CRT-D market. We are encouraged by our gain of market share and are optimistic we are well positioned for continued success in the CRT market, one of the most attractive and fastest-growing medical technology markets. We view the publication last week in the of the results of the SCD-HeFT clinical trial as a catalyst to help drive ICD penetration into a large pool of low ejection fraction patients who, until now, have not been candidates for ICDs," Starks added.
