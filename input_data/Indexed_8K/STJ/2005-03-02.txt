Exhibit 3.1
        .   The shareholders of this corporation shall hold an annual meeting in each calendar year at such time and place, within or without the state of Minnesota, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors, and for the transaction only of such other business as is properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these Bylaws; provided, however, that the interval between two consecutive annual meetings shall not be more than fourteen (14) months nor less than ten (10) months. A notice setting out the time and place of the annual meeting shall be mailed by the secretary of the corporation, or his delegate, postage prepaid, to each shareholder of record at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation, or, if no such address appears, at his last known place of residence, at least ten (10) days prior to said annual meeting, but any shareholder may waive such annual notice by a signed waiver in writing.
Section 1
        .   At the annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect directors of the corporation and shall transact such other business as may properly come before them. To be properly brought before the meeting, business must be of a nature that is appropriate for consideration at an annual meeting and must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a shareholder. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, each such notice must be given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the secretary of the corporation, not less than fifty (50) days nor more than seventy-five (75) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than sixty (60) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. Each such notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (w) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (x) the name and address of
Section 2
record of the shareholder proposing such business, (y) the class or series (if any) and number of shares of the corporation which are owned by the shareholder, and (z) any material interest of the shareholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be transacted at the annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article; provided, however, that nothing in this Article shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting, in accordance with these Bylaws.
        .   Special meetings of the shareholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at any time, by:
Section 3
                (a)        The chief executive officer;
                (b)        The chief financial officer:
                (c)        Two or more directors;
                (d)        A shareholder or shareholders holding ten percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote, except that a special meeting for the purpose of considering any action to directly or indirectly facilitate or effect a business combination, including any action to change or otherwise affect the composition of the board of directors for that purpose, must be called by 25 percent or more of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote.
        Such meeting shall be called by mailing a notice thereof as above provided in the case of the annual meeting of shareholders, which notice shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting.
        .   At any shareholders' meeting, each shareholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of common stock standing in his name on the books of the corporation as of the record date. Any shareholder may vote either in person or by proxy. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at any shareholders' meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If no quorum is present at any meeting, the shareholders present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting to such future time as they shall agree upon without further notice other than by announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken.
Section 4
        .   At any shareholders' meeting for which there is a quorum present, the shareholders may conduct such business as may be on the agenda or otherwise proposed for such meeting, or any part of such business in the case of an adjournment. All or any part of the business not conducted at the initial meeting of shareholders may be conducted at any adjournments thereof, including any specific proposals on the agenda for such initial meeting for which there was no final disposition. A meeting of the shareholders at which there is a quorum can be adjourned as to all or part of the matters to be considered at the meeting upon motion by the person presiding at such meeting and by a majority vote of shares represented in person or by proxy at such meeting. Such adjournment shall be until a specific time and place, and the time
Section 5
and place for the reconvened meeting shall be announced at the meeting and reflected in the minutes thereof. In addition, if the adjourned date is less than ten (10) days after the date of the meeting at which an adjournment proposal was passed, a public announcement shall be made by the corporation as to the time and place for the reconvened meeting; or, if the adjourned date for the reconvened meeting is ten (10) days or more after the date of the meeting at which the adjournment proposal was passed, notice of the time and place of the reconvened meeting shall be sent by first class mail to all shareholders of record at least ten (10) days prior to such reconvened meeting.
        .   The Board of Directors shall have the general management and control of all business and affairs of the corporation and shall exercise all the powers that may be exercised or performed by the corporation under the statutes, its Articles of Incorporation and its Bylaws.
Section 1
        .   (a)   The Board of Directors shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, the exact number to be fixed from time to time solely by resolution of the Board of Directors, acting by not less than a majority of the directors then in office.
Section 2
                (b)        The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 1986, two directors of the first class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1987 Annual Meeting, two directors of the second class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1988 Annual Meeting, and one director of the third class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the 1989 Annual Meeting. Commencing with the Annual meeting of Shareholders in 1987, each class of directors whose term shall then expire shall be elected to hold office for a three-year term. In the case of any vacancy on the Board of Directors, including a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, the vacancy shall be filled by election of the Board of Directors with the director so elected to serve for the remainder of the term of the director being replaced or, in the case of an additional director, for the remainder of the term of the class to which the director has been assigned. All directors shall continue in office until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office. When the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorships shall be so assigned among the classes by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as possible. No decrease in the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director.
                (c)        Any director or directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all the outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined in Article XIII of the corporation's Articles of Incorporation), voting together as a single class.
                (d)       In the event that the Board of Directors increases the number of directors or fills a vacancy on the Board in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 2, the Board of Directors shall give written notice to the shareholders of the corporation of any increase in the number of directors and of pertinent information regarding any director so elected by the Board to fill a vacancy. Such written notice shall be effected by inclusion of such information in the next mailing to shareholders of the corporation following any such increase in the number of directors or election of a director to fill a vacancy by the Board.
                (e)       A majority of the Board of Directors shall be comprised of Independent Directors. An "Independent Director" shall mean a director who:
                        (1)        has not been employed by the corporation in an executive capacity within the last five years;
                        (2)        is not, and is not affiliated with a company that is, an advisor or consultant to the corporation, or a significant customer or supplier of the corporation;
                        (3)        has no personal services contract(s) with the corporation or the corporation's senior management;
                        (4)        is not affiliated with a not-for-profit entity that receives significant contributions from the corporation;
                        (5)        is not employed by a public company at which an executive officer of the corporation serves as a director;
                        (6)        does not have a relationship described in 1 through 5 above with any affiliate of the corporation; and
                        (7)        is not a member of the immediate family of any person described in 1 through 6 above.
        .   Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common shares as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee to be appointed by the Board of Directors or by any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. However, any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such shareholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the secretary of the corporation not less than fifty (50) nor more than seventy-five (75) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than sixty (60) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first
Section 3
occurs. Each such notice to the secretary shall set forth: (i) the name and address of record of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination; (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (iii) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or employment of each nominee; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder; (v) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such shareholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation. The presiding officer of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
        .   The Board of Directors may meet regularly at such time and place as it shall fix by resolution, and no notice of regular meetings shall be required. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, or Chairperson of the Governance and Nominating Committee, or by any majority of directors by giving at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice to each of the other directors by mail, telephone, telegraph, or in person.
Section 4
        .   A majority of the directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Any act which might have been taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if authorized in a writing signed by all of the directors, and any such action shall be as valid and effective in all respects as if taken by the Board at a regular meeting.

Such Executive Committee shall act only in the interval between meetings of the Board and shall be subject at all times to the control and direction of the Board.
Section 7
        .   The officers of this corporation shall be a president, a chief executive officer, a treasurer, a secretary and such vice presidents and other officers as may from time to time be elected by the Board of Directors. If a Chairman of the Board of Directors is elected, he shall have the status of an officer of the corporation. All officers shall be elected by the Board of Directors and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. Any two (2) of the offices, except those of the president and vice president, may be held by the same person.
Section 1
        .   The president may fix and change, as he may from time to time determine, the compensation to be paid the officers, other than the president, and the employees of the corporation, subject to the power of the directors to fix and change the compensation of the officers.
Section 2
        .   The vice president, or executive vice president if there is more than one, shall perform the duties and assume the responsibilities of the president in the absence or inability to act of the president.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president if there be no Chairman, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the shareholders, shall make such reports to the Board and to the shareholders as may from time to time be required of him and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as are incident to his office or as may be from time to time assigned to him by the Board of Directors.
Section 6
        The principal office of the corporation shall be in the state of Minnesota. The corporation may also have an office or offices in such other places and in such other states as the Board of Directors may from time to time authorize and establish.

Section 2.   Indemnification mandatory; standard
                        (1)        has not been indemnified by another organization or employee benefit plan for the same judgments, penalties, fines, including, without limitation, excise taxes assessed against the person with respect to an employee benefit plan, settlements, and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding with respect to the same acts or omissions;

                        (3)        If a determination is not made under clause (1) or (2), by special legal counsel, selected either by a majority of the Board or a committee by vote pursuant to clause (1) or (2) or, if the requisite quorum of the full Board cannot be obtained and the committee cannot be established, by a majority of the full Board including directors who are parties;
                        (4)        If a determination is not made under clauses (1) to (3), by the shareholders, excluding the votes of shares held by parties to the proceeding; or
                        (5)        If an adverse determination is made under clauses (1) to (4) or under paragraph (b), or if no determination is made under clauses (1) to (4) or under paragraph (b) within sixty (60) days after the termination of a proceeding or after a request for an advance of expenses, as the case may be, by a court in Minnesota, which may be the same court in which the proceeding involving the person's liability took place, upon application of the person and any notice the court requires.
