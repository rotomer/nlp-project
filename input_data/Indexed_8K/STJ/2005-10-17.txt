Commenting on third quarter 2005 results, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said: "Our third quarter results reflect our continued progress in several major areas. Our growth in ICDs in the quarter clearly demonstrated the strength and momentum of St. Jude Medical's program and again represented clear market share gains. We continued to strengthen our gross margin and expand our investment in research and development. We reached a number of milestones in the third quarter and continued to focus on expanding growth drivers to sustain our success.
"Yesterday, we announced a definitive agreement with Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc., (ANS) that represents a compelling strategic opportunity to enter the neuromodulation medical device market and add a new long-term growth platform to St. Jude Medical," continued Mr. Starks.
During a conference call today at 7 a.m. Central Daylight Time, St. Jude Medical will further discuss these results and provide sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2005. On the call, the company will also discuss the proposed transaction with Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSI). The Company expects its consolidated EPS for the fourth quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $.39 to $.40. Given the strength of the third quarter, the Company is raising its EPS guidance for the full year of 2005 to $1.52 to $1.53. The Company's guidance excludes the impact of non-recurring items.
