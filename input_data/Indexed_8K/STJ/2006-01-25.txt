Reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 include a $107 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Advanced Neuromodulation Systems Inc.

Commenting on fourth quarter and full-year 2005 results, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said: "Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strength across our business and conclude a year of significant progress for St. Jude Medical. We achieved a number of our strategic objectives throughout the course of the year, including strong market share gains in ICDs and diversification of our future growth drivers through the successful acquisition of the ANS neuromodulation business, the Endocardial Solutions, Inc. Ensite platform, and the Velocimed vascular intervention business. We expect to continue to build and expand these new growth drivers going forward."
Fourth quarter implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) product sales were $280 million, a 62% increase over the comparable quarter of 2004. ICD product sales for the full-year 2005 were $1.007 billion, representing a 72% increase over 2004. These results continued to underscore the competitiveness of St. Jude Medical's ICD product portfolio and program.

Cardiac Surgery
St. Jude Medical sales of neuromodulation products totaled $25 million in the quarter, which reflects the consolidation of ANS with St. Jude Medical beginning November 15, 2005, the date the Company closed the initial tender offer period and acquired 89% of ANS.
Neuromodulation
The Company expects its consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2006 to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.43, excluding estimated stock compensation expense of $0.03 to $0.04. Consolidated EPS for the full year of 2006 is expected to be in the range of $1.77 to $1.80, excluding estimated stock compensation expense of $0.13 to $0.14.
First Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Guidance
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (which may include items such as litigation reserve adjustments, income tax adjustments and in-process research and development charges). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (including business development activities, strategic developments and changes in applicable laws and regulations) that vary in frequency and/or impact on the Company's results of operations. In addition, St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets, because management considers these measures to represent the results of the Company's core business operations. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
During a conference call today at 7:30 a.m. Central Standard Time, St. Jude Medical will further discuss these results and provide more information concerning sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2006.
