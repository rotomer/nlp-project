Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2006 Stock Plan
On May 10, 2006, at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company's shareholders adopted the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2006 Stock Plan (the "2006 Stock Plan"), effective as of February 24, 2006.
The purpose of the 2006 Stock Plan is to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to retain and attract executives and other key employees, non-employee directors and consultants who contribute to the Company's success by their ability, ingenuity and industry, and to enable these individuals to participate in our long-term success and growth by giving them a proprietary interest in the Company. The 2006 Stock Plan, which is administered by the Company's Compensation Committee, authorizes the grant of stock options and stock appreciation rights to officers and other key employees, directors and consultants of the Company and the Company's affiliates. An aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock is authorized for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan, subject to adjustments as set forth in the 2006 Stock Plan. In addition, certain awards under the 2006 Stock Plan are subject to limitations, as set forth in the 2006 Stock Plan.
Under the 2006 Stock Plan, each non-employee director who, on or after May 1, 2006 is (1) elected, re-elected or serving an unexpired term as a director of the Company at any annual meeting of shareholders or (2) elected as a director of the Company at any special meeting of shareholders, will, as of the date of such annual or special meeting, automatically be granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase 5,600 shares of the Company's common stock. Each non-employee director who is appointed as a director of the Company at any time other than at an annual or special meeting of the Company's shareholders will automatically be granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase a pro rata number of the 5,600 shares of common stock, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the 2006 Stock Plan.
The Board of Directors may amend, alter or discontinue the 2006 Stock Plan at any time. However, shareholder approval must be obtained for certain amendments to the 2006 Stock Plan, as set forth in the 2006 Stock Plan. The 2006 Stock Plan terminates on February 23, 2016.
This summary of the 2006 Stock Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2006 Stock Plan, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A more detailed summary of the 2006 Stock Plan can be found in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2006.
Option Grants to Non-Employee Directors
On May 10, 2006, each of the following non-employee directors of the Company received an automatic grant of a non-qualified stock option to purchase 5,600 shares of the Company's common stock: John W. Brown, Richard R. Devenuti, Stuart M. Essig, Thomas H. Garrett III, Michael A. Rocca, David A. Thompson, Stefan K. Widensohler and Wendy L. Yarno. Such grants were made pursuant to the 2006 Stock Plan. The form of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for Non-Employee Directors (the "Stock Option Agreement") used in connection with grants to non-employee directors under the 2006 Stock Plan, including the grants to the directors listed above, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Each option granted to the non-employee directors has a term of eight years and is subject to the termination provisions set forth in the Stock Option Agreement. The options become fully exercisable beginning six months after the date the option is granted; provided, however, that from and after a change of control, the options become immediately exercisable in full. Upon termination of a director's service as a director of the Company, the unvested portion of any stock options then held by such director will not thereafter be exercisable.
This summary of the Stock Option Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stock Option Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

.

Shares of Stock Available
. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b) of the Plan, the total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for distribution under the Plan shall be 5,000,000. Such shares may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares. If any shares of Stock that have been awarded are not purchased or are forfeited, or if an Award otherwise terminates without delivery of any shares of Stock, then such shares shall again be available for distribution in connection with future Awards under the Plan. In addition, regardless of whether Stock Appreciation Rights are settled in shares of Stock or cash upon exercise, the aggregate number of shares of Stock subject to the Award, rather than the number of shares of Stock actually issued or a number of shares of Stock calculated based on the amount of cash paid upon exercise, shall be counted against the number of shares of Stock authorized under the Plan.

Adjustments
. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, other change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, spin-off, split-up, or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the shares of Stock such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of shares of capital stock of the Company (or other securities or other property) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of shares of capital stock of the Company (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award and (iv) the limitations contained in Section 3(c) of the Plan.
4
c.
            
Section 162(m) Limitation for Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
. No participant may be granted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that together cover more than 500,000 shares of Stock (subject to adjustment as provided Section 3(b) of the Plan) in the aggregate in any calendar year.
d.
            
Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options
. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time the Stock Option is granted) of the Stock with respect to which an Incentive Stock Option under this Plan or any other plan of the Company and any Subsidiary or Parent Corporation is exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.
SECTION 4.
Eligibility
.
Officers and other key employees of the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary, members of the Board, and Consultants who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth and profitability of the business of the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary are eligible to be granted Awards under the Plan. The participants under the Plan shall be selected from time to time by the Committee, in its sole discretion, from among those eligible.
SECTION 5.
Stock Options
.
The Stock Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock Options and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options. To the extent that any option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option.
Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify either the Plan or any Incentive Stock Option under Section 422 of the Code. The preceding sentence shall not preclude any modification or amendment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option, whether or not such modification or amendment results in disqualification of such Stock Option as an Incentive Stock Option,
provided
that the optionee consents in writing to the modification or amendment.
Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable.
a.
            
Option Exercise Price
. The price per share of Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be no less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date the option is granted. If an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules applicable under Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary and an Incentive Stock Option is granted to such employee, the option exercise price shall be no less than 110% of Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the option is granted.
5
b.
            
Option Term
. The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than eight years after the date the option is granted. If an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary and an Incentive Stock Option is granted to such employee, the term of such option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
(i)
           
Each Non-Employee Director who, on or after May 1, 2006 is (A) elected, re-elected or serving an unexpired term as a Director of the Company at any annual meeting of holders of the Stock; or (B) elected as a Director of the Company at any special meeting of holders of Stock, shall, as of the date of such annual or special meeting, automatically be granted a Stock Option to purchase 5,600 shares of Stock at an exercise price per share equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on such date. In the case of a special meeting, the action of the holders of shares in electing a Non-Employee Director shall constitute the granting of the Stock Option to such Director and, in the case of an annual meeting, the action of the holders of shares in electing or re-electing a Non-Employee Director shall constitute the granting of the Stock Option to such Director and to any other Non-Employee Director who shall be designated as serving an unexpired term as a Director of the Company in the notice or proxy materials for the meeting; and the date when the holders of shares shall take such action shall be the date of grant of the Stock Option.
(ii)
          
Each Non-Employee Director who, on or after May 1, 2006, is appointed as a Director of the Company at any time other than at an annual or special meeting of holders of the Stock shall, as of the date of such appointment, automatically be granted a Stock Option to purchase a pro rata number of shares of Stock, which number shall be calculated by multiplying 5,600 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months that shall occur from the date of such Non-Employee Director's appointment to the date of the next annual or special meeting of the holders of the Stock and the denominator of which is 12. For purposes of this clause (ii), the number of months counted towards such pro rata grant shall include the calendar month during which the Non-Employee Director is appointed as a Director, irrespective of the actual date of appointment, but shall not include the month during which the next annual or special meeting is held, irrespective of the actual date of such meeting.
(iii)
         
All Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be designated as Non-Qualified Stock Options and shall be subject to the same terms and provisions as are then in effect with respect to the grant of Non-Qualified Stock Options to officers and key employees of the Company, except that (A) the term of each such option shall be equal to eight years, which term, subject to the provisions in Section 8, shall not expire upon the termination of service as a Director; and (B) the Stock Option shall become fully exercisable beginning six months after the date the option is granted. Upon termination of such Director's service as a Director of the Company, the unvested portion of any and all Stock Options then held by such Director shall not thereafter be exercisable. Subject to the foregoing, all provisions of this Plan not inconsistent with the foregoing shall apply to Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5(c).
6
(iv)
         
Stock Options issued under this Section 5(c) shall be in lieu of and in substitution for any new Awards of Stock Options that otherwise would be granted under the terms of the 2002 Plan or any prior stock option plan of the Company from and after May 1, 2006. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Board to issue Stock Options to any Non-Employee Director under the terms of this Plan in addition to those provided for under this Section 5(c),
provided
that no Non-Employee Director shall be granted Stock Options under this Plan, including the Options awarded under this Section 5(c), in excess of 10,000 shares in any calendar year.
SECTION 6.
Stock Appreciation Rights
.
A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof, for each share of Stock covered by such exercise, the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee,
provided
,
however
, that no Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable more than eight years after the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.

7
d.
            
Limits on Transfers of Awards
. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee or the terms of this Plan, no Award and no right under any such Award shall be transferable by a participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it determines, may permit a participant to transfer a Non-Qualified Stock Option to any "family member" (as such term is defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 (or any successor to such Instructions or such Form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) at any time that such participant holds such Non-Qualified Stock Option, provided that such transfers may not be for value (i.e., the transferor may not receive any consideration therefor) and the family member may not make any subsequent transfers other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Each Award under the Plan or right under any such Award shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by the participant (except as provided herein or in an Award Agreement or amendment thereto relating to a Non-Qualified Stock Option) or, if permissible under applicable law, by the participant's guardian or legal representative. No Award or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary.
SECTION 8.
Effect of Termination on Awards
.
a.
            
Termination by Death
. If a participant's employment by or service as a Consultant or a Director to the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary terminates by reason of death, any Award held by such participant at the time of death may thereafter be exercised, to the extent then exercisable, by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of the participant under the will of the participant, but may not be exercised after 12 months from the date of such death or the expiration of the stated term of the Award, whichever period is shorter. In the event of termination of employment or service as a Consultant or a Director by reason of death, if, pursuant to its terms, any Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, the option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
b.
            
Termination by Reason of Disability
. If a participant's employment by or service as a Consultant or a Director to the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent Corporation terminates by reason of Disability, any Award held by such participant may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of termination due to Disability, but may not be exercised after 12 months from the date of such termination of employment or service as a Consultant or a Director or the expiration of the stated term of the Award, whichever period is shorter. In the event of termination of employment or service as a Consultant or a Director by reason of Disability, if, pursuant to its terms, any Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, the option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
c.
            
Termination by Reason of Retirement
. If a participant's employment by the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent Corporation terminates by reason of Retirement, any Award held by such participant may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of termination due to Retirement, but may not be exercised after 36 months from the date of such termination of employment or the expiration of the stated term of the Award, whichever period is shorter. In the event of termination of employment by reason of Retirement, if, pursuant to its terms, any Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, the option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
8
d.
            
Termination for Cause
. If a participant's employment by or service as a Consultant or a Director to the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent Corporation is terminated for Cause, all unexercised Awards granted to such participant shall terminate immediately upon such termination.
e.
            
Other Termination
. If a participant's Continuous Status as an employee or Consultant terminates (other than upon the participant's death, Disability or Retirement or for Cause), any Award held by such participant may thereafter be exercised to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such termination, but may not be exercised after 90 days after such termination or the expiration of the stated term of the Award, whichever period is shorter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Non-Employee Director's service to the Company terminates (other than upon such Non-Employee Director's death or Disability or for Cause), whether or not such service to the Company was provided as a Consultant or a Director, any Award held by such Non-Employee Director may thereafter be exercised to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such termination and in accordance with its terms. In the event of termination of a participant's employment or service as a Consultant or a Director by reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or for Cause and if, pursuant to its terms, any Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the expiration of the exercise periods that apply for purposes of Section 422 of the Code, the option will thereafter be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
f.
             
Transfer, Leave of Absence, etc
. For purposes of this Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a termination of employment:
(i)
           
a transfer of an employee from the Company to a Parent Corporation or Subsidiary, or from a Parent Corporation or Subsidiary to the Company, or from one Subsidiary to another;
(ii)
          
a leave of absence, approved in writing by the Committee, for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Committee if the period of such leave does not exceed 90 days (or such longer period as the Committee may approve, in its sole discretion); and
(iii)
         
a leave of absence in excess of 90 days, approved by the Committee, but only if the employee's right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract, and
provided
that, in the case of any leave of absence, the employee returns to work within 30 days after the end of such leave.

SECTION 10.
Unfunded Status Of Plan
.
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. With respect to any payments not yet made to a participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver Stock or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder,
provided
,
however
, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.

The Committee may require each person purchasing shares of Stock pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the person is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.
10
All certificates for shares of Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities laws, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
b.
            
Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board of Directors from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any employee of the Company or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary any right to be retained as an employee or Consultant of the Company or a Subsidiary or Parent Corporation, as the case may be, or a Non-Employee Director to be retained as a Director, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company, Parent Corporation or a Subsidiary to dismiss a participant in the Plan from employment or service at any time, with or without cause.
c.
            
Each participant shall, no later than the date as of which any part of the value of an Award first becomes includible as compensation in the gross income of the participant for any federal tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the Award. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements and the Company, Parent Corporation and a Subsidiary shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the participant. With respect to any Award under the Plan, if the terms of such Award so permit, a participant may elect by written notice to the Company to satisfy part or all of the minimum tax withholding requirements associated with the exercise of the Award by (i) authorizing the Company to retain from the number of shares of Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to the participant, or (ii) delivering to the Company from shares of Stock already owned by the participant, that number of shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to part or all of the tax payable by the participant under this Section 11(c). Any such election shall be in accordance with, and subject to, applicable tax and securities laws, regulations and rulings.
d.
            
The internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Minnesota, shall govern all questions concerning the validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award.
SECTION 12.
Effective Date of Plan; Effect on 2002 Plan
.
The Plan shall be effective on February 24, 2006 (the date of approval by the Board), subject to the approval by shareholders of the Company. If the Plan is not so approved by the shareholders on or before one year after this Plan's adoption by the Board, this Plan shall not come into effect. The offering of the shares of Stock hereunder also shall be subject to the effecting by the Company of any registration or qualification of the shares under any federal or state law or the obtaining of the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body which the Company shall determine, in its sole discretion, is necessary or desirable as a condition to or in connection with the offering or the issue or purchase of the shares covered thereby.
On and after the date of shareholder approval of the Plan, Section 5(k) of the 2002 Plan relating to grants of Non-Qualified Stock Options to Non-Employee Directors shall be of no further force or effect, and no further Non-Qualified Stock Options shall be granted to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to Section 5(k) of the 2002 Plan.
