Item 1.01    .
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Severance Agreements with Certain Executive Officers
On July 27, 2006, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a change of control severance agreement (each, a "Severance Agreement" and collectively, the "Severance Agreements") with each of its executive officers other than Pamela S. Krop, who joined the Company as Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary on June 30, 2006 and entered into a Severance Agreement with the Company on that date, and David Fetah, Vice President, Human Resources, who is resigning from the Company effective August 31, 2006. For all of the Company's executive officers other than Ms. Krop, who had no prior agreements with the Company, Mr. Fetah and Christopher G. Chavez, President, Neuromodulation Division, the Severance Agreements supersede and replace the previous severance agreements between the Company and such executive officers. For Mr. Chavez, the Severance Agreement replaced his Special Termination Agreement dated April 1, 2002 (the "Chavez Termination Agreement") with Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. ("ANS"). The Company also entered into Severance Agreements with seven employees who are not executive officers. For six of these non-executive employees, the Severance Agreements replaced prior agreements.
The Severance Agreements provide for certain payments and other benefits if, following a Change in Control, the Company terminates the executive's employment without Cause or the executive terminates his or her employment for Good Reason. Such payments and benefits include: (1) severance pay equal to 2.9 times the sum of the executive's annual salary, target bonus, annual perk package and certain other compensation paid to the executive during the 12 months prior to the termination (a reduction from the amount payable under the prior agreements, as discussed under Item 1.02 below); (2) three years of life, health, accident and disability insurance benefits substantially similar to those in effect at the time of termination; (3) payment of legal fees and expenses relating to the termination; (4) termination of any non-competition arrangement between the Company and the executive; and (5) a gross-up payment for certain excise taxes, if they are imposed on such payments or benefits, and for any tax imposed on such gross-up payment.
Under the Severance Agreements, "Change in Control" is defined to include a change in control of the type required to be disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission proxy rules, acquisition by a person or group of 35% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company, a proxy fight or contested election which results in Continuing Directors (as defined) not constituting a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, or another event the majority of the Continuing Directors determines to be a change in control, and "Cause" is defined as a conviction for felony criminal conduct. "Good Reason" is defined to include a change in the executive's responsibility or status, a reduction in salary or benefits, a mandatory relocation or the failure by the Company to obtain an assumption of the Company's obligations under the Severance Agreements by any successor to the Company. In addition, if the Change in Control arises from a transaction which is not authorized, recommended or approved by formal action taken by the Continuing Directors, the executive may voluntarily terminate his or her employment for any reason on the 180 day following the Change in Control, and such termination will be deemed "Good Reason" under the Severance Agreements.

Amendment to Employment Agreement with Christopher G. Chavez
On July 27, 2006, the Company (through ANS) and Christopher G. Chavez entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Employment Agreement (the "Employment Agreement"), effective as of April 1, 2002, by and between ANS and Mr. Chavez, which remained in effect following the Company's acquisition of ANS on November 29, 2005. The Employment Agreement was described in, and filed (via incorporation by reference from Exhibit 10.16 to the ANS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002) as Exhibit 10.23 to, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Amendment clarifies that if Mr. Chavez is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) in connection with a "change-in-control" (as defined in the Severance Agreement), then he will not be entitled to receive severance compensation under the Employment Agreement and will only be entitled to severance compensation under the Severance Agreement.
The above summary of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 1.02    .
Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
Upon execution of the Severance Agreements described under Item 1.01 above, effective July 27, 2006, the Company terminated its prior severance agreements with its executive officers other than Mr. Fetah, whose agreement was terminated in connection with his resignation from the Company, and Ms. Krop, who did not have a prior severance agreement with the Company. The form of the Company's prior severance agreement with its executive officers was filed as Exhibit 10.18 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 and is incorporated herein by reference. A detailed summary of the prior severance agreements can be found in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 30, 2006. The prior severance agreements were substantially similar to the new Severance Agreements except that the prior severance agreements provided for severance pay equal to 3.0 times (rather than the 2.9 times under the new Severance Agreements) the sum of the executive's annual salary, target bonus, annual perk package and certain other compensation paid to the executive during the 12 months prior to the termination.
The Severance Agreement with Mr. Chavez superseded and replaced, and thus terminated, the Chavez Termination Agreement. The Chavez Termination Agreement was described in, and filed (via incorporation by reference from Exhibit 10.18 of the ANS Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002) as Exhibit 10.24 to, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Chavez Termination Agreement provided that, upon a "change-in-control" (as defined in the Chavez Termination Agreement), Mr. Chavez would be entitled to severance pay in an amount equal to 299% of his highest annual salary and targeted annual bonus, payment of any excise taxes Mr. Chavez incurs as a result of the severance payment and payment of any income and excise taxes on the excise tax payments, and a job search payment.

The amounts due to Executive under this Section 4(i) shall be paid to Executive in a lump sum not later than one business day prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective.

All of the factors included in Annual Compensation shall be those in effect on the date that the termination of Executive's employment became effective and shall be calculated without giving effect to any reduction in such compensation that would constitute a breach of this Agreement.
 
(c)          For a period of 36 months following the date that the termination of Executive's employment became effective or until Executive reaches age 65 or dies, whichever is the shorter period, the Company shall arrange to provide for Executive, at the Company's expense, the health, accident, disability and life insurance benefits substantially similar to those in effect for Executive immediately prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment became effective.
 
(d)          The Company shall pay to Executive (1) any amount earned by Executive as a bonus with respect to the fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of Executive's employment if such bonus has not theretofore been paid to Executive, and (2) an amount representing credit for any vacation earned or accrued by Executive but not taken.
 
(e)          The Company shall also pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive as a result of such termination of employment (including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred by Executive in contesting or disputing any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided to Executive by this Agreement whether by arbitration or otherwise).
(f)          Any and all contracts, agreements or arrangements between the Company and Executive prohibiting or restricting Executive from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, any business or company competitive with the Company at any time or during any period after the date the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, shall be deemed terminated and of no further force or effect as of the date the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, to the extent, but only to the extent, such contracts, agreements or arrangements so prohibit or restrict Executive;
provided
that
the foregoing provision shall not constitute a license or right to use any proprietary information of the Company and shall in no way affect any such contracts, agreements or arrangements insofar as they relate to nondisclosure and nonuse or proprietary information of the Company notwithstanding the fact that such nondisclosure and nonuse may prohibit or restrict Executive in certain competitive activities.
 
(ii)           In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control of the Company or termination of Executive's employment (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, contract, agreement or arrangement with the company, with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company or with any person constituting a member of an "affiliated group" as defined in Section 280G(d)(5) of the Code, with the Company or with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company (collectively, the "Total Payments")) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, or any interest, penalties or additions to tax with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest, penalties or additions to tax, are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then Executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") within thirty business days of such determination in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest, penalties or additions to tax imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax, imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Total Payments. All determinations required to be made under this Section 4(ii), including whether a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, shall be made by the independent accounting firm retained by the Company on the date of the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and Executive within 15 business days of the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it shall furnish Executive with an opinion that Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on Executive's federal income tax return.
 
Any uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder shall be resolved in favor of Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that at a later time there will be a determination that the Gross-Up Payments made by the Company were less than the Gross-Up Payments that should have been made by the Company ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that Executive is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment, if any, that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that at a later time there will be a determination that the Gross-Up Payments made by the Company were more than the Gross-Up Payments that should have been made by the Company ("Overpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. Executive agrees to refund the Company the amount of any Overpayment that the Accounting Firm shall determine has occurred hereunder. Any good faith determination by the Accounting Firm as to the amount of any Gross-Up Payment, including the amount of any Underpayment or Overpayment, shall be binding upon the Company and Executive.
(iii)          Any payment not made to Executive when due hereunder shall thereafter, until paid in full, bear interest at the rate of interest equal to the reference rate announced from time to time by Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, plus two percent, with such interest to be paid to Executive upon demand or monthly in the absence of a demand.
 
(iv)          Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment or benefit provided in this section 4 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of any employment by another employer, by any retirement benefits or otherwise.
 
5.             Executive's Agreements.
 
Executive agrees that:
 
(i)            Without the consent of the Company, Executive will not terminate employment with the Company without giving 30 days prior notice to the Company, and during such 30-day period Executive will assist the Company, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Company, in training the successor to Executive's position with the Company. The provisions of this Section 5(i) shall not apply to any termination (voluntary or involuntary) of the employment of Executive pursuant to Section 2(ii)(c) hereof.
 
(ii)           In the event that Executive has received any benefits from the Company under Section 4 of this Agreement, then, during the period of 36 months following the date that the termination of Executive's employment became effective, Executive, upon request by the Company:
 
(a)          Will consult with one or more of the executive officers concerning the business and affairs of the Company for not to exceed four hours in any month at times and places selected by Executive as being convenient to him, all without compensation other than what is provided for in Section 4 of this Agreement; and
 
(b)          Will testify as a witness on behalf of the Company in any legal proceedings involving the Company which arise out of events or circumstances that occurred or existed prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment became effective (except for any such proceedings relating to this Agreement), without compensation other than what is provided for in Section 4 of this Agreement, provided that all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Executive in connection with serving as a witness shall be paid by the Company.
Executive shall not be required to perform Executive's obligations under this Section 5(ii) if and so long as the Company is in default with respect to performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement.
 
6.           .
Successors and Binding Agreement
 
(i)          The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder if Executive terminated employment after a Change in Control for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company and any successor to its business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 6(i) or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
 
(ii)         This Agreement is personal to Executive, and Executive may not assign or transfer any part of Executive's rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to him hereunder, to any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees.
 
7.           
Modification; Waiver
. No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived, or discharged unless such waiver, modification, or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board of Directors of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
 
8.           
Notice
. All notices, requests, demand, and all other communications required or permitted by either party to the other party by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any notice of termination of employment and any notice of an intention to arbitrate) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or received by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at the address of the other party, as first written above (directed to the attention of the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in the case of the Company). Either party hereto may change its address for purposes of this Section 8 by giving 15 days prior notice to the other party hereto.
9.           
Severability
. If any term or provision of this agreement or the application hereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
10.         
Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
 
11.         
Governing Law
. This Agreement has been made in the State of Minnesota and shall, in all respects, be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota, including all matters of construction, validity and performance.
 
12.         
Effect of Agreement; Entire Agreement
. The Company and Executive understand and agree that this Agreement is intended to reflect their agreement only with respect to payments and benefits upon termination in certain cases and is not intended to create any obligation on the part of either party to continue employment. This Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements or policies made relating to the subject matter hereof [(including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement)] and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof;
provided
that
this Agreement shall not supersede or limit in any way Executive's rights under any benefit plan, program or arrangements in accordance with their terms (other than the provisions of the Company's policy HR-1.02.25 entitled "Severance Pay," effective January 1, 1994, as amended from time to time, or any successor to such policy, to the extent that payments are made hereunder).
 
13.

SECTION 3. This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
