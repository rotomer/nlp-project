St. Jude Medical Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2006 Results
 
Announces $1 Billion Stock Repurchase Plan
 
St. Paul, Minn.  January 25, 2007  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 30, 2006. The company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion in St. Jude Medical common stock.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results
 
The company reported net sales of $864 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of more than 9% compared to the $790 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased fourth quarter sales by about $14 million.
 
Net sales in 2006 were $3.302 billion compared to $2.915 billion in 2005, an increase of 13%. Unfavorable foreign currency translation comparisons decreased full-year 2006 sales by about $7 million.
 
Reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $155 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, which includes a retroactive benefit of approximately $0.03 per share related to the recently approved research and development tax credit for the first nine months of 2006. This compares to reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 of $5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.
 
Reported net earnings for 2006 were $548 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, which includes a $0.06 special charge related to the previously announced restructuring of the Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Divisions to create one Cardiovascular Division effective January 1, 2007.
 
Commenting on the fourth quarter and full-year 2006 results, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said: "Our fourth quarter results reflect the significant progress we are making within all of our growth platforms. Momentum is strong in our new growth platforms, particularly in Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation, and the improvement we are seeing in the overall ICD market supports our optimism in a recovery for that market in 2007. St. Jude Medical's people, products and customer relationships drove our growth in the fourth quarter, and we will continue to invest in these areas to support our sustained success moving forward."
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
Total CRM sales were $535 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, a 4% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Total CRM product sales for the full-year 2006 were $2.056 billion, representing a 7% increase over 2005. In 2006, St. Jude Medical gained the No. 2 market share position in the CRM category of products, which includes implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker products.
 
Fourth quarter ICD product sales were $289 million, a 3% increase over the comparable quarter of 2005. ICD product sales for the full-year 2006 were $1.1 billion, representing a 9% increase over 2005.
 
Fourth quarter pacemaker sales were $246 million, an increase of 6% from the comparable quarter of 2005. Total pacemaker sales for 2006 were $956 million, up 4% over 2005.
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
AF product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $91 million, a more than 26% increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Total AF sales for 2006 were $326 million, a 28% increase over 2005.

Cardiovascular
As part of the Company's efforts to optimize product development and overall operating efficiencies, St. Jude Medical announced in 2006 that it was combining its Cardiac Surgery and Cardiology Divisions to create a new Cardiovascular Division, effective January 1, 2007. Total sales of Cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $188 million, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Total Cardiovascular product sales for 2006 were $741 million, up 4% over 2005.
 
Sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $87 million, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Total vascular closure product sales for 2006 were $341 million, up 3% over 2005.
 
Total heart valve product sales for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $66 million, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2005. Total heart valve product sales for 2006 were $271 million, up 7% over 2005.
 
First Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and the full-year 2007. The Company expects its consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2007 to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 per diluted share. Consolidated earnings for full-year 2007 are expected to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75.
 
 
 
Common Stock Repurchase Program
 
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of St. Jude Medical common stock. The Company intends to repurchase the shares in the first half of 2007 through open market and privately negotiated transactions.
 
"The Board's decision to adopt a new stock repurchase program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value and our confidence in the significant upside that can be generated by St. Jude Medical's multiple growth platforms," said Daniel J. Starks, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to providing for a return of capital to shareholders, this capital allocation program has been carefully structured to ensure that we maintain the financial strength necessary to support the innovation that will fuel St. Jude Medical's continued success. We believe the repurchase of our stock is a compelling investment opportunity and look forward to realizing the growth opportunities ahead."
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, restructuring charges, litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. The Company's non-GAAP adjusted net earnings also exclude stock-based compensation expense which the Company started recording under FAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis. The Company's non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share include the effects of FAS 123R on the number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
