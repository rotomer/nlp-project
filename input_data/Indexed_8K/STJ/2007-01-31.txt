Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
 
On January 25, 2007, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $700 million interim liquidity facility (the "Interim Facility") with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"). The Interim Facility creates a $700 million unsecured credit facility that the Company can draw upon to finance share repurchases under the Company's share repurchase authorization announced on January 25, 2007. Borrowings under the Interim Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.35%, or in the event over half of the facility is drawn on, LIBOR plus 0.40%, in each case subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of an event of default. The Interim Facility expires on April 26, 2007. Bank of America provides investment banking services to the Company from time to time.
 
The Company is also a party to that certain Multi-Year $1 Billion Credit Agreement, dated December 13, 2006 with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, as Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lender (the "Credit Agreement").
 
The Interim Facility incorporates various operating and financial covenants from the Credit Agreement. Among other requirements, the Company must have a leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization)) not exceeding 3.0 to 1.0. The Interim Facility also incorporates from the Credit Agreement limitations on additional liens or subsidiary indebtedness and limitations on certain acquisitions, investments and dispositions of assets. No interest coverage ratio covenant is included in the Interim Facility. In the event that the Company defaults and the default is continuing under the Interim Facility, the facility may be terminated by Bank of America, and all outstanding principal and interest may become due and payable.
 
The foregoing description of the Interim Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Interim Facility, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
