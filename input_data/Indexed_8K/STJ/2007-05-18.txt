On May 16, 2007, at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company's shareholders adopted the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Stock Incentive Plan"), effective as of May 16, 2007.
 
The purpose of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan is to enable the Company to attract, retain, motivate and compensate employees, officers, consultants, advisors and non-employee Directors capable of assuring the future success of the Company through various stock-based arrangements, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with the Company's shareholders. The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards, stock awards, and other stock-based awards. The term of each non-qualified stock option, incentive stock option and stock appreciation right may not be longer than 8 years from the date of grant. The term of awards other than non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be longer than 10 years. Five million shares of the Company's common stock are authorized and reserved for issuance under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to adjustments as set forth in the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.
 
The Company's Board of Directors may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan at any time, except as provided in the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan terminates on May 15, 2017, unless earlier terminated by the Company's Board of Directors. Termination of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan will not affect any awards that are outstanding on the date of termination.
 
This summary of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The Company's shareholders also adopted the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2007 ESPP") at the Annual Meeting, effective as of May 16, 2007.
 
The purpose of the 2007 ESPP is to enable the Company to obtain and retain the services of employees. In addition, the 2007 ESPP provides a convenient, meaningful opportunity for employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, thereby increasing participating employees' personal interest in the Company's success. Five million shares of the Company's common stock are authorized and reserved for issuance under the 2007 ESPP, subject to adjustments as set forth in the 2007 ESPP.
 
The Board of Directors may at any time and for any reason terminate or amend the 2007 ESPP, except as provided in the 2007 ESPP. The 2007 ESPP has no fixed termination date and will continue in effect until all of the shares authorized under the 2007 ESPP have been issued or such earlier time as the 2007 ESPP is terminated in accordance with its terms.
 
This summary of the 2007 ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2007 ESPP, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated herein by reference.

Power and Authority of the Committee
Affiliate. The Company intends that Awards under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid any adverse tax results thereunder and the Committee shall administer and interpret the Plan and all Award Agreements in a manner consistent with that intent. In this regard, if any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement would result in adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may amend that provision (or take any other action reasonably necessary) to avoid any adverse tax results and no action taken to comply with Section 409A of the Code shall be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any holder of an Award or beneficiary thereof.
(b)          . The Committee may delegate its powers and duties under the Plan to one or more Directors (including a Director who is also an officer of the Company) or a committee of Directors, subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may establish in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Committee shall not delegate its powers and duties under the Plan (i) with regard to officers or directors of the Company or any Affiliate who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (ii) in such a manner as would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Delegation
(c)          . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan, unless the exercise of such powers and duties by the Board would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Power and Authority of the Board of Directors
(a)          . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued under all Awards under the Plan shall be 5,000,000. Shares to be issued under the Plan will be authorized but unissued Shares or Shares that have been reacquired by the Company and designated as treasury shares. If any Shares covered by an Award or to which an Award relates are not purchased or are forfeited or are reacquired by the Company (including shares of Restricted Stock, whether or not dividends have been paid on such shares), or if an Award otherwise terminates or is cancelled without delivery of any Shares, then the number of Shares counted pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Plan against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture, reacquisition by the Company, termination or cancellation, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. Shares that are withheld in full or partial payment to the Company of the purchase or exercise price relating to an Award or in connection with the satisfaction of tax obligations relating to an Award shall not be available for granting Awards under the Plan.
Shares Available
(b)          . For purposes of this Section 4, if an Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted, in accordance with this Section 4(b), on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. With respect to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by one Share for each Share covered by such Award or to which such Award relates. With respect to any Awards other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by three Shares for each Share covered by such Award or to which such Award relates. For Stock Appreciation Rights settled in Shares upon exercise, the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, rather than the number of Shares actually issued upon exercise, shall be counted against the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. Awards that do not entitle the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares and Awards that are settled in cash shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
Accounting for Awards
(c)          . In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award and (iv) the limitations contained in Section 4(d) of the Plan.
Adjustments
(d)          .
Award Limitations Under the Plan
(i)
           
. No Eligible Person may be granted Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or any other Award or Awards under the Plan, the value of which Award or Awards is based solely on an increase in the value of the Shares after the date of grant of such Award or Awards, for more than 500,000 Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan) in the aggregate in any calendar year.
Section 162(m) Limitation for Certain Types of Awards
(ii)
          
. The maximum amount payable pursuant to all Performance Awards to any Participant in the aggregate in any calendar year shall be $3,500,000 in value, whether payable in cash, Shares or other property. This limitation does not apply to any Award subject to the limitation contained in Section 4(d)(i) of the Plan.
Section 162(m) Limitation for Performance Awards
Any Eligible Person shall be eligible to be designated a Participant. In determining which Eligible Persons shall receive an Award and the terms of any Award, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective Eligible Persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company or such other factors as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to full-time or part-time employees (which term as used herein includes, without limitation, officers and Directors who are also employees), and an Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to an employee of an Affiliate unless such Affiliate is also a "subsidiary corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code or any successor provision.
(a)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Options
(i)           . The purchase price per Share purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the Committee and shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option; provided, however, that the Committee may designate a per share exercise price below Fair Market Value on the date of grant (A) to the extent necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy applicable legal or regulatory requirements of a foreign jurisdiction or (B) if the Option is granted in substitution for a stock option previously granted by an entity that is acquired by or merged with the Company or an Affiliate.
Exercise Price
(ii)          . The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not be longer than 8 years from the date of grant.
Option Term
(iii)        . The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part and the method or methods by which, and the form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the applicable exercise price) in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.
Time and Method of Exercise
(b)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Persons subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right; provided, however, that the Committee may designate a per share grant price below Fair Market Value on the date of grant (A) to the extent necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Committee, to satisfy applicable legal or regulatory requirements of a foreign jurisdiction or (B) if the Stock Appreciation Right is granted in substitution for a stock appreciation right previously granted by an entity that is acquired by or merged with the Company or an Affiliate. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that the term of each Stock Appreciation Right shall not be longer than 8 years from the date of grant. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.
Stock Appreciation Rights
(c)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
(i)           . Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote a Share of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or other right or property with respect thereto), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit acceleration of vesting of such Awards in the event of the Participant's death, disability or retirement or a change in control of the Company.
Restrictions
(ii)          . Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted and may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates, which certificate or certificates shall be held by the Company. Such certificate or certificates shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. Shares representing Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived. In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted. Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, such Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holder of the Restricted Stock Units.
Issuance and Delivery of Shares
(iii)         . Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a Participant's termination of employment or resignation or removal as a Director (in either case, as determined under criteria established by the Committee) during the applicable restriction period, all Shares of Restricted Stock and all Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant at such time shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
Forfeiture
(d)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Dividend Equivalents to Eligible Persons under which the Participant shall be entitled to receive payments (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property as determined in the discretion of the Committee) equivalent to the amount of cash dividends paid by the Company to holders of Shares with respect to a number of Shares determined by the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Dividend Equivalents may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not grant Dividend Equivalents to Eligible Persons in connection with grants of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to such Eligible Persons.
Dividend Equivalents
(e)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons Performance Awards which are intended to be "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). A Performance Award granted under the Plan may be payable in cash or in Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock). Performance Awards shall, to the extent required by Section 162(m), be conditioned solely on the achievement of one or more objective Performance Goals, and such Performance Goals shall be established by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m). Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Performance Goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted, the amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award and any other terms and conditions of any Performance Award shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also certify in writing that such Performance Goals have been met prior to payment of the Performance Awards to the extent required by Section 162(m).
Performance Awards
(f)           . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons Shares without restrictions thereon, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Stock Awards may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
Stock Awards
(g)          . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, subject to the terms of the Plan and the Award Agreement. Shares, or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section 6(g), shall be purchased for consideration having a value equal to at least 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities on the date the purchase right is granted. The consideration paid by the Participant may be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof), as the Committee shall determine.
Other Stock-Based Awards

The Committee may establish procedures as it deems appropriate for a Participant to designate a Person or Persons, as beneficiary or beneficiaries, to exercise the rights of the Participant and receive any property distributable with respect to any Award in the event of the Participant's death. The Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it determines, may permit a Participant to transfer a Non-Qualified Stock Option to any "family member" (as such term is defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 (or any successor to such Instructions or such Form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) at any time that such Participant holds such Option, provided that such transfers may not be for value (, the transferor may not receive any consideration therefor) and the family member may not make any subsequent transfers other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Each Award under the Plan or right under any such Award shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant (except as provided herein or in an Award Agreement or amendment thereto relating to a Non-Qualified Stock Option) or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative.

(vi)         . All Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, applicable federal or state securities laws and regulatory requirements, and the Committee may cause appropriate entries to be made or legends to be placed on the certificates for such Shares or other securities to reflect such restrictions. If the Shares or other securities are traded on a securities exchange, the Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares or other securities covered by an Award unless and until such Shares or other securities have been admitted for trading on such securities exchange.
Restrictions; Securities Exchange Listing
(a)          . The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement, prior approval of the shareholders of the Company shall be required for any amendment to the Plan that:

(b)          . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may waive any conditions of or rights of the Company under any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such action may adversely affect the rights of the holder of such Award without the consent of the Participant or holder or beneficiary thereof.
Amendments to Awards
(c)          . The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan.
Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies
In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant, are withheld or collected from such Participant. In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax obligation by (a) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes or (b) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes. The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
(a)          . No Eligible Person, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
No Rights to Awards

Award Agreements
(c)          . Except with respect to Restricted Stock and Stock Awards, neither a Participant nor the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until the Shares have been issued.
No Rights of Shareholders
(d)          . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation plans or arrangements, and such plans or arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
No Limit on Other Compensation Plans or Arrangements
(e)          . The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, or a Director to be retained as a Director, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause. In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.
No Right to Employment or Directorship
(f)           . The internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Minnesota, shall govern all questions concerning the validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award.
Governing Law
(g)          . If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
(h)          . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
No Trust or Fund Created
(i)           . The Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares until the requirements of any federal or state securities or other laws, rules or regulations (including the rules of any securities exchange) as may be determined by the Company to be applicable are satisfied.
Securities Matters
(j)           . No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Share or whether such fractional Share or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
No Fractional Shares
(k)          . Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Headings
The Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company to be held on May 16, 2007 and the Plan shall be effective as of the date of such shareholder approval.
The Plan shall terminate at midnight on May 15, 2017, unless terminated before then by the Board. Awards may be granted under the Plan until the Plan terminates or until all Shares available for Awards under the Plan have been purchased or acquired; provided, however, that Incentive Stock Options may not be granted following the 10-year anniversary of the Board's adoption of the Plan. The Plan shall remain in effect as long as any Awards are outstanding.

If your employment terminates or if you resign or are removed from or otherwise cease to serve on, the Company's Board of Directors prior to the vesting of the Shares pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, your rights to all of the unvested Shares shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, including the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive cash dividends on such Shares, unless otherwise determined by the Committee administering the Plan, except that if you die, become Disabled, or in the case of an employee, terminate employment by reason of Normal Retirement or Early Retirement prior to the vesting or forfeiture of all Shares pursuant to Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, you shall become immediately and unconditionally vested in all of the Shares for which vesting has occurred as a result of such event in accordance with the terms of the Award Certificate and your rights to all of the unvested Shares shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the attached Award Certificate, and the restrictions with respect to all such vested Shares shall lapse, on the date of your death, that you become Disabled or you terminate employment by reason of Normal Retirement or Early Retirement.

4
The Plan shall be implemented by a series of consecutive Contribution Periods. The first Contribution Period shall commence on August 1, 2007 and shall end on July 31, 2008. The Plan shall continue until terminated in accordance with Sections 19 and 22 hereof.
(a)
          
An eligible Employee may become a Participant by following the established enrollment procedure as directed by the Committee, or other entity designated by the Committee, prior to the Commencement Date of the applicable Contribution Period, unless an earlier or later time for completing the enrollment procedure is set by the Committee for all eligible Employees with respect to a given Contribution Period. The eligible Employee shall determine the amount of the Participant's Compensation (subject to Section 6(a) hereof) to be paid as Contributions pursuant to the Plan.
(b)
          
Payroll deductions shall commence on the first payroll paid on or following the Commencement Date and shall end on the last payroll paid on or prior to the Purchase Date of the Contribution Period, unless sooner terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof. A Participant who has elected to participate in a Contribution Period shall automatically participate in the next Contribution Period until such time as such Participant withdraws from the Plan or terminates employment as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(a)
          
A Participant shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each payroll paid during the Contribution Period in full dollar amounts not less than $5 and not more than 10% (or such other maximum percentage as the Board may establish from time to time before any Commencement Date) of such Participant's Compensation on each payroll paid during the Contribution Period. All payroll deductions made by a Participant shall be credited to his or her Account under the Plan. A Participant may not make any additional payments into his or her Account. No assets in a Participant's Account shall be subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the Participant.
(b)
          
A Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(c)
          
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant may decrease the amount of his or her Contributions once during a Contribution Period by following the established administrative procedures as directed by the Committee to authorize a decrease in the payroll deduction amount. The decrease in amount shall be effective as soon as administratively
5
feasible following the date of receipt by the Company, or other entity designated by the Committee. However, any decrease in amount must be made at least 30 days prior to the end of the Contribution Period to ensure such decrease shall be effective within the current Contribution Period.
(d)
          
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant may not increase the amount of his or her Contributions during a Contribution Period. A Participant may only increase the amount of his or her Contributions with respect to a future Contribution Period by following the established administrative procedures as directed by the Committee to authorize an increase in the payroll deduction amount. The increase in amount shall be effective as of the Commencement Date of the next Contribution Period following the date of receipt by the Company, or other entity designated by the Committee.
(e)
          
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, a Participant's payroll deductions may be adjusted during any Contribution Period, subject to the discretion of the Committee. Payroll deductions shall re-commence at the amount provided in such Participant's most recently submitted enrollment materials at the beginning of the first Contribution Period that is scheduled to end in the next succeeding calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.
On the Commencement Date of each Contribution Period, each eligible Employee participating in such Contribution Period shall be granted an option to purchase on the Purchase Date a number of Shares determined by dividing such Employee's Contributions accumulated prior to such Purchase Date and retained in the Participant's Account as of the Purchase Date by the applicable Purchase Price, subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof.
Unless a Participant ceases to be an eligible Employee as provided in Section 3 or withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof, his or her option for the purchase of Shares will be exercised automatically on each Purchase Date of each Contribution Period, and the maximum number of Shares (which may include a fractional Share) subject to the option will be purchased at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated Contributions in his or her Account. The Shares purchased upon exercise of an option hereunder shall be deemed to be transferred to the Participant on the Purchase Date. During his or her lifetime, a Participant's option to purchase Shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.
6
As promptly as practicable after each Purchase Date of each Contribution Period, the number of Shares purchased by each Participant upon exercise of his or her option shall be delivered in accordance with procedures established from time to time by the Committee, and a transfer agent for the Common Stock may be utilized or a brokerage or nominee account may be established for this purpose. The terms of such transfer agency or brokerage or nominee account shall be at the sole discretion of the Company, and participation in the Plan is expressly conditioned on the acceptance of such terms.
(a)
          
A Participant may withdraw from the Plan by following the established administrative procedures as directed by the Committee, or other entity designated by the Committee. The withdrawal request will be effective as soon as administratively feasible. However, any withdrawal request must be made at least 30 days prior to the end of a Contribution Period to ensure such withdrawal request shall be effective within such Contribution Period. Once the withdrawal request is effective, all of the Participant's Contributions credited to his or her Account will be paid to him or her with interest, his or her option will be automatically terminated, and no further Contributions for the purchase of Shares will be made absent re-enrollment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Officer shall not have the right to withdraw Contributions credited to his or her account under the Plan except in accordance with Section 10(b) hereof. Upon withdrawal from the Plan, a Participant may not re-enroll in the Plan until the next Contribution Period. In order to re-enroll, a Participant must follow the provisions set forth under Section 5(a) hereof.
(b)
          
Upon termination of the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee prior to the Purchase Date of a Contribution Period for any reason, including death or retirement, the Contributions credited to his or her Account will be returned to him or her or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14 hereof, in either case [with interest, and his or her option will be automatically terminated. Whether the Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee has been terminated shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event that any Designated Subsidiary ceases to be a Designated Subsidiary of the Company, the employees of such Designated Subsidiary shall no longer be Employees for purposes of Section 3(a) hereof as of the date such Designated Subsidiary ceases to be a Designated Subsidiary.
(c)
          
A Participant's withdrawal from the Plan shall not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or any Subsidiary.
7
In any situation where the Plan provides for the payment of interest on the Contributions of a Participant in the Plan, such interest rate shall be determined by the Committee and disclosed the Participants prior to the Commencement Date.
(a)
          
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18 hereof, the maximum number of Shares which shall be issued under the Plan shall be 5,000,000 Shares. If on a given Purchase Date, the number of Shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of Shares available for sale under the Plan on such Purchase Date, the Committee shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares available for purchase on such Purchase Date among all Participants, and the balances in the Accounts shall be refunded without interest to the respective Participants.
(b)
          
The Participant shall have no interest or voting right in Shares covered by his or her option until such option has been exercised.
(a)
          
The Committee
. The Plan shall be administered by a committee (the "Committee") established by the Board. The members of the Committee need not be directors of the Company and shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board.
(b)
          
Powers of Committee
. The Committee shall supervise and administer the Plan and shall have full power to adopt, amend and rescind any rules deemed desirable and appropriate for the administration of the Plan and not inconsistent with the Plan, to construe and interpret the Plan, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. Decisions of the Committee will be final and binding on all parties who have an interest in the Plan. The Committee may delegate ministerial duties to such of the Company's employees, outside entities and outside professionals as the Committee so determines.
(c)
          
Power and Authority of the Board
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan.
8
In the event of the death of a Participant, the Company shall deliver any Shares and cash in the Participant's Account to a beneficiary previously designated by the Participant or, if there is no surviving beneficiary duly designated, to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such Shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
Neither Contributions credited to a Participant's Account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive Shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds in accordance with Section 10 hereof.
All Contributions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such Contributions. The Plan is unfunded and shall not create nor be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship among the Company, the Board, the Committee and the Participant. To the extent a Participant acquires a right to receive payment from the Company pursuant to the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
Accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Account statements will be made available to participating Employees by the Company and will set forth the amounts of Contributions, the Purchase Price per Share, the number of Shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
(a)
          
Adjustment
. The number of Shares set forth in Section 12 hereof, the price per Share covered by each option under the Plan that has not yet been exercised and the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased by a Participant in a calendar year pursuant to Section
9
3(b) hereof, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock (including any such change in the number of Shares effected in connection with a change in domicile of the Company). Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares issuable hereunder or subject to an option hereunder.
(b)
          
Corporate Transactions
. In the event of a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Contribution Period then in progress will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such action, unless otherwise provided by the Board in its sole discretion, and in such event, all outstanding options shall automatically terminate and the balance in the Accounts shall be refunded with interest to the respective Participants. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, each option outstanding under the Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for outstanding options, the Contribution Period then in progress shall be shortened and a new Purchase Date shall be set (the "New Purchase Date"), as of which date the Contribution Period then in progress will terminate. The New Purchase Date shall be on or before the date of consummation of the Corporate Transaction and the Board shall notify each Participant in writing, at least 10 days prior to the New Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for his or her option has been changed to the New Purchase Date and that his or her option will be exercised automatically on the New Purchase Date, unless prior to such date he or she has withdrawn from the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof. For purposes of this Section 18, an option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be assumed, without limitation, if, at the time of issuance of the stock or other consideration upon a Corporate Transaction, each holder of an option under the Plan would be entitled to receive upon exercise of the option the same number and kind of shares of stock or the same amount of property, cash or securities as such holder would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the Corporate Transaction if the holder had been, immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction, the holder of the number of Shares covered by the option at such time (after giving effect to any adjustments in the number of Shares covered by the option as provided for in this Section 18); provided however that if the consideration received in the transaction is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent (as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code), the Board may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon exercise of the option to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair market value, as determined by the Committee, to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Corporate Transaction.
10
The Board may, if it so determines in the exercise of its sole discretion, also make provision for adjusting the number of Shares set forth in Section 12 hereof, as well as the price per Share covered by each outstanding option, in the event that the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, rights offerings or other increases or reductions of its outstanding Common Stock, and in the event the Company is consolidated with or merged into any other corporation.
(a)
          
The Board may at any time and for any reason terminate or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 18 hereof, no such termination of the Plan may affect options previously granted, provided that the Plan or the Contribution Period may be terminated by the Board on a Purchase Date or by the Board's setting a new Purchase Date with respect to a Contribution Period then in progress if the Board determines that termination of the Plan and/or the Contribution Period is in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders or if continuation of the Plan and/or the Contribution Period would cause the Company to incur adverse accounting charges as a result of a change after the effective date of the Plan in the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Plan. Except as provided in Section 18 hereof and in this Section 19, no amendment to the Plan shall make any change in any option previously granted that adversely affects the rights of any Participant. In addition, to the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or Section 423 of the Code (or, in either case, any successor rule or provision or any applicable law or regulation) or the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval in such a manner and to such a degree as so required.
(b)
          
Without shareholder approval and without regard to whether any Participant rights may be considered to have been adversely affected, the Board shall be entitled to change the Contribution Periods and/or the Purchase Price as permitted under the Plan, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount deducted during a Contribution Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts deducted in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll deductions in excess of the amount designated by a Participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed payroll deduction elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Shares for each Participant properly correspond with amounts deducted from the Participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Board determines in its sole discretion to be advisable and consistent with the Plan.
11
All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
Shares shall not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, applicable state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.
The Plan shall become effective upon approval by the Company's shareholders. It shall continue in effect until all of the Shares set forth in Section 12 hereof are exhausted or such earlier time as the Plan is terminated pursuant to Section 19 hereof.
The terms and conditions of options granted hereunder to, and the purchase of Shares by, Officers shall comply with the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3. This Plan shall be deemed to contain, and such options shall be deemed to contain, and the Shares issued upon exercise thereof shall be subject to, such additional conditions and restrictions as may be required by Rule 16b-3 to qualify for the maximum exemption from Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to Plan transactions.
12
The internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Minnesota, shall govern all questions concerning the validity, construction and effect of the Plan, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan.
If any provision of the Plan is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan under any law, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without materially altering the intent of the Plan, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, and the remainder of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.
Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to give any person (including an Employee or Participant) the right to remain in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary or to affect the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any person (including the Employee or Participant) at any time with or without cause. Nothing in this Plan shall confer on any person any legal or equitable right against the Company or any Subsidiary, or give rise to any cause of action at law or in equity against the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Shares purchased hereunder nor any other benefits conferred hereby, including the right to purchase Common Stock at a discount, shall form any part of the wages or salary of any eligible Employee for purposes of severance pay or termination indemnities, irrespective of the reason for termination of employment. Under no circumstances shall any person ceasing to be an Employee be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit under this Plan which such Employee might otherwise have enjoyed but for termination of employment, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful or unfair dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise.
The Committee shall have the power and authority to allow any of the Company's Subsidiaries other than Designated Subsidiaries to adopt and join in the portion of this Plan that is not intended to comply with Section 423 of the Code and to allow employees of such Subsidiaries who work or reside outside of the United States an opportunity to acquire Shares in accordance with such special terms and conditions as the Committee may establish from time to time, which terms and conditions may modify the terms and conditions of the Plan set forth elsewhere in this Plan. Without limiting the authority of the Committee, the special terms and
13
conditions which may be established with respect to any foreign country, and which need not be the same for all foreign countries, include but are not limited to the right to participate, procedures for elections to participate, the payment of any interest with respect to amounts received from or credited to accounts held for the benefit of participants, the purchase price of any Shares to be acquired, the length of any Contribution Period, the maximum amount of contributions, credits or Shares which may be acquired by any participating employees, and a participating employee's rights in the event of his or her death, disability, withdrawal from participation in the purchase of Shares hereunder, or termination of employment. Any purchases made pursuant to the provisions of this Section 27 shall not be subject to the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.
Participants are responsible for the payment of all income taxes, employment, social insurance, welfare and other taxes under applicable law relating to any amounts deemed under the laws of the country of their residency or of the organization of the Subsidiary employing such Participant to constitute income arising out of the Plan, the purchase and sale of Shares pursuant to the Plan and the distribution of Shares or cash to the Participant in accordance with this Plan. Each Participant hereby authorizes the relevant Subsidiary to make appropriate withholding deductions from each Participant's compensation, which shall be in addition to any payroll deductions made pursuant to Section 6, and to pay such amounts to the appropriate tax authorities in the relevant country or countries in order to satisfy any of the above tax liabilities of the Participant under applicable law.
By participating in the Plan, each Participant shall be deemed to have accepted all the conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee and shall be fully bound thereby.
 
Approved by the Board on February 23, 2007, subject to shareholder approval.
