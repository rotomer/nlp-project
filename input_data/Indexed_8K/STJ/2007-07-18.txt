St. Jude Medical Reports Second Quarter Results
 
St. Paul, Minn.  July 18, 2007  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
 
Second Quarter Results
 
The Company reported net sales of $947 million in the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 14% compared to the $833 million in the second quarter of 2006. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased second quarter sales by approximately $21 million.
 
Reported net earnings for the second quarter of 2007 were $135 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, which includes a special charge related to the settlement of a patent litigation matter this quarter that reduced earnings by $0.06 per diluted share. This compares to reported net earnings for the second quarter of 2006 of $141 million, or $0.38 per diluted share.
 
Commenting on the second quarter results, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, "Every major segment of St. Jude Medical's business contributed growth, market share gains, or both for the third consecutive quarter. Over 75% of our revenue grew at double-digit rates for the second quarter in a row. Due to these results and our strong outlook for the second half of 2007, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the full-year."

Third Quarter and Full Year 2007 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will update its range for revenue expectations for the third quarter and the full-year for its product categories.
 
The Company expects its consolidated earnings for the third quarter of 2007 to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.45 per diluted share and is raising its guidance for consolidated earnings per share for the full-year 2007 to the range of $1.74 to $1.78. This guidance does not include the impact on earnings per share of the special charge recorded in the second quarter of 2007. A further reconciliation of the Company's annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
