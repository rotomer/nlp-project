Item 7.01   Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
At an investor conference today, St. Jude Medical will announce that it expects to report revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $1.018 billion, representing the Company's first ever $1 billion quarter and $41 million above the high end of the Company's guidance. Based on preliminary estimates, the Company believes that approximately $20 million of sales in the fourth quarter are attributable to a competitor's recall of ICD leads and should be considered a one time event. St. Jude Medical will also announce that it is comfortable with current analysts' consensus earnings per share expectations in 2008 of $2.09. The Company will announce fourth quarter revenue by product category and earnings results and review its outlook for 2008 during its regularly scheduled earnings call on January 23, 2008.
