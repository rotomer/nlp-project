St. Jude Medical Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2007 Results
 
Company Records First $1 Billion Revenue Quarter
 
St. Paul, Minn.  January 23, 2008  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 29, 2007.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Sales
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.018 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, representing the Company's first ever $1 billion quarter, $41 million above the high end of the Company's guidance and an increase of 18% compared to the $864 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased fourth quarter sales by approximately $41 million. In each product category, sales for the fourth quarter exceeded the high end of the Company's fourth quarter revenue guidance.
 
Net sales in 2007 were $3.779 billion compared to $3.302 billion in 2006, an increase of 14%. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased full-year 2007 sales by about $100 million.
 
Commenting on the fourth quarter results and the strength of the business during 2007, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, "During the fourth quarter and throughout 2007, every major segment of St. Jude Medical's business contributed to our growth, market share gains, or both. The breadth and depth of our growth across all of our major product platforms in 2007 reinforces our confidence that we are investing in the right markets and that our long term growth program is on track."
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
 
Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker products, were $637 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, a 19% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Based on estimates and as previously announced, the Company believes that approximately $20 million of sales in the fourth quarter are attributable to a competitor's recall of ICD leads and should be considered a one time event. Total CRM product sales for the full-year 2007 were $2.369 billion, representing a 15% increase over 2006.
 
Of that total, ICD product sales were $358 million in the fourth quarter, a 24% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. ICD product sales for the full-year 2007 were $1.305 billion, representing a 19% increase over 2006.
 
Fourth quarter pacemaker sales were $279 million, an increase of 13% from the comparable quarter of 2006. Total pacemaker sales for 2007 were $1.064 billion, up 11% over 2006.
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
 
AF product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $117 million, a 29% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. Total AF sales for 2007 were $410 million, a 26% increase over 2006.
 
Neuromodulation
 
Neuromodulation product sales were $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, up 18% from the comparable quarter of 2006. Total neuromodulation product sales for 2007 were $210 million, up 17% over 2006.

Sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $91 million, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. Total vascular closure product sales for 2007 were $355 million, up 4% over 2006.
 
Total heart valve product sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $74 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2006. Total heart valve product sales for 2007 were $290 million, up 7% over 2006.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Results
 
In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $71 million, or $0.20 per share, approximately $50 million of which relate to non-cash items, including asset impairment charges and write-offs of inventory related to discontinued products. The remaining charges are primarily associated with initiatives being undertaken to streamline the Company's operations, mostly in international geographies. Including these charges, reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $118 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares to reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $155 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. Reported net earnings for 2007 were $559 million, or $1.59 per diluted share.
 
Excluding these charges, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $189 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings for the full year 2007 were $652 million, or $1.85 per diluted share. See the attached reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to the Company's GAAP diluted earnings per share.
 
First Quarter and Full-Year 2008 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the first quarter and full-year 2008 by product category.
 
The Company expects its consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.52 per diluted share. Consolidated earnings for full-year 2008 are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
