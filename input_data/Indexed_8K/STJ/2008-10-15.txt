St. Jude Medical Reports Third Quarter Results
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.  October 15, 2008  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the third quarter ended September 27, 2008.
 
Third Quarter Results
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.084 billion in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 17% compared to the $927 million in the third quarter of 2007. Favorable foreign currency translation comparisons increased third quarter sales by approximately $40 million.
 
Reported net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $193 million, or $0.55 per diluted share. This compares to reported net earnings for the third quarter of 2007 of $160 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. In accordance with GAAP, reported net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 do not include any benefit from the federal research and development tax credit, even though this tax credit was extended for 2008 and 2009 earlier this month retroactive to the beginning of the year. Including the benefit of this adjustment, adjusted net earnings for the third quarter of 2008 were $198 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. A further reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share to the Company's GAAP diluted earnings per share is provided in the schedule below.
 
Commenting on the third quarter results, the Company's growth program, and the year to date cash flow from operations, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, "Our results this quarter reflect the depth and breadth of St. Jude Medical's growth program. Revenue for every division grew at a double digit rate while our operating profit margin improved over 100 basis points compared with the third quarter one year ago. For the nine months ended September 27, 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $650 million, a 33% increase over the first three quarters of 2007."
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
 
Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker products, were $678 million for the third quarter of 2008, a 15% increase compared to the third quarter of 2007.
 
Of that total, ICD product sales were $381 million in the third quarter, a 20% increase compared to the third quarter of 2007.
 
Third quarter pacemaker sales were $297 million, an increase of 10% from the comparable quarter of 2007.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the fourth quarter by product category.
 
The Company expects its consolidated earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share and for full-year 2008 in the range of $2.30 to $2.32. A reconciliation of the Company's quarterly and annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
