Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
In conjunction with an investor conference this week, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the "Company") will provide an update to its earnings outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008 and fiscal year 2009 to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the Company's third quarter earnings conference call. The updated outlook assumes that the current exchange rate environment for all of the currencies affecting the operations of St. Jude Medical remains consistent through 2009. Specifically, for the two main currencies affecting the operations of the Company, the Euro and the Yen, the Company assumes that each Euro will translate into $1.25 to $1.30 and that each 95-100 Yen will translate into one U.S. dollar.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2008, consolidated earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60, reflecting lower revenues due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company now expects total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $1.058 billion to $1.123 billion and CRM product sales for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $660 million to $695 million.
 
For 2009, the Company expects consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.52, including the effect of foreign exchange. The Company will provide additional information and detail regarding its guidance for 2009 revenue and consolidated earnings per share when it reports 2008 fourth quarter and full-year results in late January 2009.
