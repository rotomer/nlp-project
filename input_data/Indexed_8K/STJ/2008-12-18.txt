Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On December 18, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("CAFC") issued rulings in connection with an appeal in a long standing patent litigation that Guidant Corporation (now Boston Scientific Corporation, "BSX") and Mirowski Family Ventures, LCC ("MFV") initiated against St. Jude Medical, Inc. ("SJM").
 
The patent litigation at issue was originally initiated in November 1996, and is currently limited to the 288 patent which expired in 2003.
 
The decision by the CAFC is one of many in the over 12 years of this litigation and has no material impact on SJM's consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.
 
Background
In the appeal
, Cardiac Pacemakers v. St. Jude Medical
, Docket No. 2007-1296 (Fed. Cir.), BSX and MFV sought to overturn rulings issued by the District Court in
Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.
et al. v. St. Jude Medical, Inc. et al.
, Civil Action No. 1-96-cv-1718 DFH/TAB, (S.D. Ind.).
 
More specifically, BSX and MFV requested the CAFC to reverse the following rulings the district court judge made in favor of SJM:
 
 
 
The CAFC heard oral arguments in the appeal in October 2008.
 
The CAFC's December 18, 2008 Ruling
While the CAFC reversed the District Court's summary judgment ruling declaring the patent invalid, it affirmed one of the District Court's key rulings in favor of SJM limiting damages only to those relatively few instances where the cardioversion method described in the only remaining claim in the 288 patent was practiced.
 
SJM had previously limited its exposure in this case in its July 29, 2006 settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with BSX. See Form 8-K filed by SJM on July 31, 2006. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, BSX agreed it would not seek recovery of lost profits, prejudgment interest or a royalty rate in excess of 3% of net sales for any patents found to be infringed by SJM products.
 
As such, although the invalidity of the patent has now been overturned, the damages in the case going forward are limited to those relatively few instances prior to the expiration of the patent in 2003 when the cardioversion therapy method described in the only remaining claim of the 288 patent is actually practiced. Given these circumstances, the ultimate damages, if any, would have no material impact on SJM's consolidated earnings, financial position or cash flows.
