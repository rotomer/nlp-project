ST. PAUL, Minn.  Jan. 27, 2009  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended Jan. 3, 2009.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Sales
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.133 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 11 percent compared to the $1.018 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Foreign currency translation comparisons decreased fourth quarter sales by approximately $29 million.
 
Net sales in 2008 were $4.363 billion compared to $3.779 billion in 2007, an increase of 15 percent. Foreign currency translation comparisons increased full-year 2008 sales by about $120 million.
 
Commenting on the fourth quarter and full-year results and the Company's growth program, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, "We are pleased to have achieved strong growth across all of our product platforms in 2008, including a 14 percent revenue increase in Cardiac Rhythm Management. The solid outperformance in our Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation businesses in the fourth quarter in particular underscore the long-term growth opportunities and acceleration of these programs. St. Jude Medical's growth, together with actions we have taken to advance our product platforms through acquisitions, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve continued success."
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
 
Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which include implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and pacemaker products, were $680 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, a 7 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Of that total, ICD product sales were $387 million in the fourth quarter, an 8 percent increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The fourth quarter of 2007 contained a one-time revenue benefit to ICD sales due to a competitive product being off the market for a period of time. ICD product sales for the full-year 2008 were $1.534 billion, representing an 18 percent increase over 2007.
 
Fourth quarter pacemaker sales were $293 million, an increase of 5 percent from the comparable quarter of 2007. Total pacemaker sales for 2008 were $1.167 billion, up 10 percent over 2007.

Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Results
 
In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded purchased in-process research and development charges of $319 million, or $0.92 per share, related primarily to the previously announced acquisition of MediGuide, Inc. The Company also recorded other pre-tax charges of $162 million, or $0.29 per share, comprised principally of non-cash intangible asset impairment charges. In addition to these charges, during the fourth quarter, the Company recorded a retroactive benefit of approximately $0.05 per share related to the research and development credit for the first nine months of 2008. Including these items, reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $194 million, or $0.56 per share. This compares to reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 of $118 million, or $0.34 per share. For the full-year 2008, reported net earnings were $384 million, or $1.10 per share.
 
Excluding these charges and the income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $210 million, or $0.60 per share. Adjusted net earnings for the full year 2008 were $807 million or $2.31 per share. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per share to the Company's GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the schedule at the end of the press release.
 
First Quarter and Full Year 2009 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the first quarter and full year by product category.
 
The Company expects its consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2009 to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share and for full-year 2009 in the range of $2.48 to $2.54.
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
