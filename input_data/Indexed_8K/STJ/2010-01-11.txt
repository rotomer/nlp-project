The Company expects to report net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 of approximately $1.203 billion. For 2009, preliminary full-year sales were $4.681 billion, an increase of approximately 10 percent versus full-year 2008 sales on a constant currency basis. The Company remains comfortable with its guidance that fourth quarter adjusted consolidated earnings per share will be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63.
 
Commenting on preliminary fourth quarter 2009 results, Daniel J. Starks said, "We are encouraged by our sales this quarter, and in particular with the sequential increase in sales seen in every product category during the fourth quarter, particularly with fewer selling days. We believe St. Jude Medical is well positioned for 2010."
 
Fourth quarter cardiac rhythm management (CRM) sales were approximately $698 million, slightly higher than the mid-point of the Company's previously issued guidance range. Implantable cardiac defibrillators were approximately $395 million. Pacemaker sales were approximately $303 million. Full year 2009 CRM sales were $2.769 billion, up 5 percent constant currency. 
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) product sales for the fourth quarter were approximately $171 million, above the top end of the Company's previously issued guidance range. Full year 2009 AF sales were $628 million, up 17 percent compared with constant currency sales the previous year.
 
Fourth quarter sales of cardiovascular products were $240 million, near the upper end of the previously issued guidance range. Full-year sales for cardiovascular products were $953, up 13 percent compared with the prior year constant currency.
 
Fourth quarter sales of neuromodulation products were approximately $94 million, above the top end of the Company's previously issued guidance range. Full-year sales for neuromodulation products were $331, up 32 percent constant currency.
 
The Company will release its final fourth quarter and full-year results and provide its first quarter and full-year 2010 guidance on January 27 at 6:30 a.m. Central Time.
