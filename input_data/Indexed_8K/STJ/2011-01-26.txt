Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Earnings Results
 
In the fourth quarter the Company recorded after-tax charges of $27 million, related primarily to the closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of AGA Medical including an increase in cost of goods sold related to the step up in inventory values required under acquisition accounting. Also during the fourth quarter, the Company reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle the previously disclosed 2005 industry-wide investigation in Boston and recorded after-tax charges of $15 million. Additional charges during the fourth quarter included after-tax inventory obsolescence charges of approximately $18 million and an after-tax investment write-down of $5 million reflecting a decline in the fair value of a strategic cost investment.
 
Also during the fourth quarter, the federal research and development tax credit was extended for both 2010 and 2011, retroactive to the beginning of 2010.  As a result, during the fourth quarter we recorded a $20 million benefit to income tax expense, representing the cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first three quarters of 2010. 
 
Including these items, reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $206 million, or $0.62 per share. This compares to reported net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $190 million, or $0.57 per share. For the full-year 2010, reported net earnings were $907 million, or $2.75 per share.
 
Excluding these items, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $251 million, or $0.75 per share. Adjusted net earnings for the full year 2010 were $995 million or $3.01 per share. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per share to the Company's GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the schedule at the end of the press release.
 
First Quarter and Full Year 2011 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the first quarter and full year 2011 by product category.
 
 
 
 
The Company expects its consolidated adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.79 per diluted share and for full-year 2011 in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. A reconciliation of the Company's quarterly and annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, acquisitions, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to income taxes and litigation) that vary in frequency and impact on the Company's results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
