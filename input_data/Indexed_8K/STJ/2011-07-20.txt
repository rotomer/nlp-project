St. Jude Medical Reports Second Quarter 2011 Results
 
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.  July 20, 2011  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the second quarter ended July 2, 2011.
 
Second Quarter Sales
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.447 billion in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 10 percent compared with the $1.313 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Revenue for the second quarter increased 4 percent after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency. Foreign currency translation comparisons increased second quarter sales by approximately $75 million.
 
Commenting on the second quarter and the Companys growth program, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, St. Jude Medical delivered record sales during the second quarter. We are making good progress implementing our new growth drivers and diversifying our growth portfolio. Although sales in the U.S. were down 2% due primarily to weakness in the U.S. cardiac rhythm management market, international sales increased 23% and now represent the majority of our business.
 
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
 
Total CRM sales, which include ICD and pacemaker products, were $793 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 1 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2010. Total CRM sales for the second quarter grew 3 percent after adjusting for the one-time benefit of a competitors suspension of sales of ICD products in the United States during the prior year.
 
Of that total, ICD product sales were $477 million in the second quarter, a 1 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the one-time benefit we experienced in the U.S. in the prior year, ICD revenue grew 5 percent this quarter.
 
Second quarter pacemaker sales were $316 million, essentially equal to the second quarter of 2010.
 
 
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
 
AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $208 million, an 18 percent increase over the second quarter of 2010.
 
Neuromodulation
 
St. Jude Medical sales of neuromodulation products were $104 million in the second quarter of 2011, up 9 percent from the comparable quarter of 2010.
 
Cardiovascular
 
Total cardiovascular sales, which primarily include vascular and structural heart products, were $342 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 35 percent increase over the second quarter of 2010. This division now includes sales from AGA Medical, Inc., which St. Jude Medical acquired in November 2010.
 
Sales of vascular products during the second quarter of 2011 were $189 million, up 14 percent from the comparable quarter of 2010.
 
Structural heart product sales for the second quarter of 2011 were $153 million, a 74 percent increase over the second quarter of 2010, with the addition of AGA Medical products to the business.
 
Second Quarter Earnings Results
 
In the second quarter of 2011 the Company recorded after-tax charges of $10 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the remaining increase in cost of goods sold that resulted from the step up in inventory values required under acquisition accounting associated with the AGA Medical acquisition.
 
In addition, the Company recognized $32 million, or $0.10 per share, in other after-tax charges, primarily related to restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter to realign certain activities within its CRM business. A key component of these restructuring activities relates to the Companys decision to transition CRM manufacturing out of Sweden to more cost-advantaged locations.
 
Including these items, reported net earnings for the second quarter of 2011 was $241 million, or $0.72 per share. This compares to reported net earnings for the second quarter of 2010 of $254 million, or $0.77 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted net earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $283 million, or $0.85 per share. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per share to the Company's GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the schedule at the end of the press release.
 
Third Quarter and Full Year 2011 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the third quarter and full year by product category.
 
The Company expects its consolidated adjusted net earnings for the third quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.76 per diluted share and for the full-year to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.30. A further reconciliation of the Companys quarterly and annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Companys short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, acquisitions, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation) that vary in frequency and impact on the Companys results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
