Third Quarter Earnings Results
 
In the third quarter, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $21 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related primarily to ongoing restructuring actions that began in the second quarter to realign certain activities in our CRM business as well as employee termination and other costs primarily associated with continuing efforts to improve our international sales and sales support organization. Also during the third quarter, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $9 million, or $0.03 per share, related to increased collection risk for accounts receivable related to one customer in Europe.
 
Including these items, reported net earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $226 million, or $0.69 per share. This compares to reported net earnings for the third quarter of 2010 of $208 million or $0.63 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted net earnings for the third quarter of 2011 were $256 million, or $0.78 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per share to the Companys GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the schedule at the end of the press release.
Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2011 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the fourth quarter and full-year by product category and update its expectations related to full-year earnings per share.
 
The Company expects its consolidated adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.85 per diluted share and for full-year 2011 consolidated adjusted net earnings to now be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28 per diluted share. A reconciliation of the Companys quarterly and annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Companys short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, acquisitions, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Companys results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
