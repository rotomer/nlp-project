St. Jude Medical Reports First Quarter 2012 Results
 
ST. PAUL, Minn.  April 18, 2012  St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) today reported sales and net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
First Quarter Sales
 
The Company reported net sales of $1.395 billion in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 1 percent compared with the $1.376 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Foreign currency translation comparisons decreased first quarter sales by approximately $7 million. On a currency neutral basis, net sales grew 2 percent over the first quarter of 2011.
 
Commenting on the first quarter and the Companys growth program, St. Jude Medical Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel J. Starks said, First quarter results exceeded expectations for sales and adjusted earnings per share. This was driven especially by innovations designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of health care such as our new line of Unify Quadra ICDs in the U.S. We look forward to building on our strong start to 2012 by introducing our Portico line of transcatheter heart valves and our EnligHTN line of renal denervation products in Europe before the end of this year.
 
Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM)
 
Total CRM sales, which include ICD and pacemaker products, were $735 million for the first quarter of 2012, a 4 percent decrease compared with the first quarter of 2011.
 
Of that total, ICD product sales were $450 million in the first quarter, a 3 percent decrease compared with the first quarter of 2011.
 
First quarter pacemaker sales were $285 million, a decrease of 4 percent from the comparable quarter of 2011.
 
Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
 
AF product sales for the first quarter totaled $221 million, a 13 percent increase over the first quarter of 2011.
 
Neuromodulation
 
St. Jude Medical sales of neuromodulation products were $103 million in the first quarter of 2012, up 12 percent from the comparable quarter of 2011.
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular
 
Total cardiovascular sales, which primarily include vascular and structural heart products, were $336 million for the first quarter of 2012, a 3 percent increase over the first quarter of 2011.
 
Sales of vascular products during the first quarter of 2012 were $181 million, down 2 percent from the comparable quarter of 2011.
 
Structural heart product sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $155 million, an 8 percent increase over the first quarter of 2011.
 
First Quarter Earnings Results
 
During the first quarter of 2012, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $29 million, primarily related to our previously announced restructuring actions initiated during the second quarter of 2011 to streamline manufacturing within our CRM business. This consists primarily of closing down operations at our location in Sweden as well as costs associated with our continuing efforts to leverage our sales and sales support organizations. In addition, we recognized $25 million in after-tax charges related to a settlement involving a dispute over the final payments due under a license agreement involving the vascular closure product line.
 
Including these items, reported net earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were $212 million, or $0.67 per share. This compares to reported net earnings for the first quarter of 2011 of $233 million, or $0.71 per share.
 
In accordance with GAAP, reported net earnings for the first quarter 2012 do not include any benefit from the research and development tax credit, which has yet to be extended for 2012. Including the benefit of this adjustment and excluding the first quarter charges, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were $272 million, or $0.86 per share. A reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP adjusted net earnings per share to the Companys GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the schedule at the end of the press release.
 
Second Quarter and Full Year 2012 Sales and Earnings Guidance
 
During a conference call today, St. Jude Medical will provide its range for revenue expectations for the second quarter and full year by product category.
 
The Company expects its consolidated adjusted net earnings for the second quarter of 2012 to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88 per diluted share and is raising its full-year 2012 guidance to be in the range of $3.44 to $3.49. A reconciliation of the Companys quarterly and annual guidance is provided in the schedule below.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The Company provides adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Companys short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain adjustments (such as in-process research and development charges, impairment charges, restructuring charges, litigation charges or litigation reserve adjustments and income tax adjustments). These adjustments result from facts and circumstances (such as business development activities, restructuring activities, asset impairment events or developments, settlements and other developments relating to litigation and resolution of audits by tax authorities) that vary in frequency and impact on the Companys results of operations. St. Jude Medical management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare results of current periods to prior periods on a consolidated basis.
 
 
 
 
The Company provides constant currency sales growth because St. Jude Medical management believes that in order to properly understand the Companys short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales. St. Jude Medical management uses constant currency sales growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the Company as well as to compare sales of current periods to prior periods.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
