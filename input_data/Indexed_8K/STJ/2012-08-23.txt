As previously announced, Mr. Thomas H. Garrett, a member of the Board of Directors of St. Jude Medical, Inc. (the Company), passed away on August 19, 2012. Mr. Garrett had been a member of the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, along with Michael A. Rocca, Chairman of the committee, and Richard R. Devenuti. As a result of Mr. Garretts death, on August 22, 2012, the Company notified the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) that the Company was not in compliance with Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual which requires that audit committees be comprised of at least three independent directors.
