Item 8.01     
Other Events
 
In late September 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commenced an inspection of St. Jude Medical, Inc.s (the Company) Sylmar, California facility, and, following such inspection, issued eleven observations on a Form 483.  The Form 483, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, has been redacted, as is customary, by the Company based on its good faith interpretation of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption (b)(4), which protects confidential and proprietary information from disclosure.  The Company has sent its proposed redactions to the FDA, and the FDA will make an independent assessment of the Form 483 before releasing it. The Company will  provide written responses to the FDA no later than Nov. 7, 2012 (within fifteen working days of the issuance of the Form 483, as recommended by the FDA) detailing proposed corrective actions, and has initiated efforts and redirected resources to address the FDAs observations.  It is important to note that none of the observations identified a specific issue regarding the clinical or field performance of any particular device.  The Sylmar, California facility will continue to manufacture cardiac rhythm management devices while the Company works with the FDA to address these observations.  While the Company believes that the costs associated with remediation of these observations will not have a material impact on the Companys financial results, consistent with the Companys comments regarding the audit of its Sylmar facility on its recent earnings call and the high level of public attention these statements have received, the Company believes it is appropriate to provide additional clarity and transparency on this matter.  The Company takes quality and product safety very seriously and is committed to fully resolving the quality system observations identified during this most recent FDA inspection.
