(a) The Trust Securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the Trust Property, and Distributions (including of Additional Amounts) will be made on the Trust Securities at the rate and on the dates that payments of interest (including of Additional Interest, as defined in the Indenture) are made on the Debentures. Accordingly: (i) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative, and will accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Trust available for the payment of Distributions. Distributions shall accumulate from January 21, 2003 and, except in the event (and to the extent) that the Depositor exercises its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, commencing on May 15, 2003. If any date on which a Distribution is otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which such payment was originally payable (each date on which distributions are payable in accordance with this Section 4.1(a), a "Distribution Date"). (ii) The Trust Securities shall be entitled to Distributions at the Distribution Rate in respect of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities. The amount of Distributions payable for any period shall include any Additional Amounts in respect of such period. -18-
(iii) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made by the Property Trustee from the Payment Account and shall be payable on each Distribution Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. (b) The Distribution Rate in respect of the Capital Securities will be a floating rate per annum determined by reference to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus a spread of .50%. "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered rate for three-month, U.S. dollar deposits and, with respect to any Distribution Period, will be calculated by Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), as follows: (i) On the second Market Day preceding the commencement of such Distribution Period (each, a "Determination Date"), 3-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rate for deposits of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 for a period of three months (the "Index Maturity"), commencing on the second Market Day immediately preceding the commencement of such Distribution Period, which appears on the display designated as Page 3750 on the Dow Jones Telerate Service (or such other pages as may replace Page 3750 on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks) ("Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m., London time on said Determination Date. If no such offered rate appears, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to such Distribution Period will be determined as described in (ii) below. (ii) With respect to a Determination Date on which no such offered rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 as described in (i) above, 3-Month LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean, expressed as a percentage, of the offered rates (unless by its terms such display provides for only a single rate, in which case a single rate shall be used) for deposits in U.S. dollars for the Index Maturity that appears on the display designated as "LIBO" on the Reuters Monitor Money Market Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks) ("Reuters Screen LIBO Page") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such date. If, in turn, at least two such rates are not displayed on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page at such time (unless, as aforesaid, only a single rate is required), the Calculation Agent will obtain from each of four reference banks in London selected by the Calculation Agent ("Reference Banks") such bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such date for deposits in U.S. dollars to prime banks in the London interbank market for the Index Maturity. If two or more such quotations are provided as requested, then 3-Month LIBOR for such date shall be the arithmetic average of such quotations. If, in turn, fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, then 3-Month LIBOR for such date will be obtained from the preceding Market Day for which the Telerate Page 3750 displayed a rate for the Index Maturity. (iii) If on any Determination Date, the Calculation Agent is required but unable to determine 3-Month LIBOR in the manner provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, 3-Month LIBOR for such Distribution Period shall be 3-Month LIBOR as determined on the previous Determination Date. -19-
The Distribution Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law. All percentages resulting from any calculations referred to in this Trust Agreement will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a percentage point, with five hundred-thousandths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 6.87655% (or .0687655) would be rounded to 6.8766% (or ..068766)), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards). The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date, determine the Distribution Rate and inform the Debenture Trustee, the Property Trustee and the Paying Agent. Unless otherwise provided by the Property Trustee, the Paying Agent will calculate the amount of Distributions payable in respect of the following Distribution Period (the "Distribution Amount"). The Distribution Amount shall be calculated by applying the Distribution Rate to the Liquidation Amount of each Trust Security outstanding at the commencement of the Distribution Period, multiplying each such Liquidation Amount by the actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned (which actual number of days shall include the first day but exclude the last day of such Distribution Period) divided by 360 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards). The determination of the Distribution Rate by the Calculation Agent and the Distribution Amount by the Paying Agent will (in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error) be final, conclusive and binding on all concerned. None of the Debenture Trustee, the Property Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Issuer Trust or the Company (or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, beneficiaries, employees or affiliates) shall have any liability to any Person for (i) the selection of any Reference Bank or (ii) any inability to retain major banks in the London interbank market, in the case of the Calculation Agent, which is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Upon the request of a holder of a Capital Security, the Calculation Agent will provide the Distribution Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Distribution Rate for the next Distribution Period with respect to the Capital Securities. Each such Distribution Rate may be obtained by telephoning the Calculation Agent. (c) Distributions on the Trust Securities with respect to a Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities at the close of business on the relevant record date, which, as long as the Capital Securities remain in book-entry only form, will be at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the relevant Distribution Date. In the event that the Capital Securities do not continue to remain in book-entry form, the record date for payment of Distributions shall be at the close of business on the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding the relevant Distribution Date. Section 4.2 Redemption. -20-
(a) On each Debenture Redemption Date and on the stated maturity of the Debentures, the Issuer Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the Redemption Price. (b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price or if the Redemption Price cannot be calculated prior to the time the notice is required to be sent, the estimate of the Redemption Price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such Redemption Price is calculated); (iii) the CUSIP number or CUSIP numbers of the Capital Securities affected; (iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the identification and the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the particular Trust Securities to be redeemed; (v) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date, except as provided in Section 4.2(d) below; and (vi) if the Capital Securities are no longer in book-entry-only form, the place or places where the Capital Securities Certificates are to be surrendered for the payment of the Redemption Price. (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Debentures. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the Redemption Price shall be payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Issuer Trust has funds then on hand and available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price. (d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Capital Securities, then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.2(c), the Property Trustee will, with respect to Book-Entry Capital Securities, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for such Book-Entry Capital Securities, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give such Clearing Agency irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities. With respect to Capital Securities that are not Book-Entry Capital Securities, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.2(c), will irrevocably deposit with -21-
the Paying Agent, to the extent available therefor, funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities upon surrender of their Capital Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive the Redemption Price and any Distribution payable in respect of the Trust Securities on or prior to the Redemption Date, but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the event that payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Trust Securities called for redemption is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Issuer Trust or by the Depositor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accumulate, as set forth in Section 4.1, from the Redemption Date originally established by the Issuer Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price. (e) Subject to Section 4.3(a), if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to be redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based upon the relative Liquidation Amounts of such classes. The particular Capital Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis based upon their respective Liquidation Amounts not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Capital Securities not previously called for redemption, provided that so long as the Capital Securities are in book-entry-only form, such selection shall be made in accordance with the customary procedures for the Clearing Agency for the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Capital Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Capital Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Capital Securities shall relate, in the case of any Capital Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the aggregate Liquidation Amount of Capital Securities that has been or is to be redeemed. Section 4.3 Subordination of Common Securities. (a) Payment of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, the Redemption Price of, and the Liquidation Distribution in respect of the Trust Securities, as applicable, shall -22-
be made, subject to Section 4.2(e), pro rata among the Common Securities and the Capital Securities based on the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date, Redemption Date or Liquidation Date any Event of Default resulting from a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1) or 5.1(2) of the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including any Additional Amounts) on, Redemption Price of, or Liquidation Distribution in respect of any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on all Outstanding Capital Securities for all Distribution Periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, or in the case of payment of the Liquidation Distribution the full amount of such Liquidation Distribution on all Outstanding Capital Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) on, or the Redemption Price of, the Capital Securities then due and payable. (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Event of Default resulting from any Debenture Event of Default, the Holders of the Common Securities shall have no right to act with respect to any such Event of Default under this Trust Agreement until the effect of all such Events of Default with respect to the Capital Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all such Events of Default under this Trust Agreement with respect to the Capital Securities have been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Capital Securities and not on behalf of the Holders of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Capital Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. Section 4.4 Payment Procedures. Payments of Distributions (including any Additional Amounts) in respect of the Capital Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Capital Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency in immediately available funds. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Holders of the Common Securities. Section 4.5 Tax Returns and Reports. The Administrative Trustees shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Depositor's expense, and file all United States Federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required to be filed by or in respect of the Issuer Trust. In this regard, the Administrative Trustees shall (a) prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Internal Revenue Service forms required to be filed in respect of the Issuer Trust in each taxable year of the Issuer Trust, and (b) prepare and furnish (or cause to be prepared and furnished) to each Holder all Internal Revenue Service forms required to be provided by the Issuer Trust. The Administrative Trustees -23-
shall provide the Depositor and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns and reports promptly after such filing or furnishing. The Issuer Trustees shall comply with United States Federal withholding and backup withholding tax laws and information reporting requirements with respect to any payments to Holders under the Trust Securities. Section 4.6 Payment of Expenses of the Issuer Trust. The Depositor shall pay to the Issuer Trust, and reimburse the Issuer Trust for, the full amount of any costs, expenses or liabilities of the Issuer Trust (other than obligations of the Issuer Trust to pay the Holders of any Capital Securities or other similar interests in the Issuer Trust the amounts due such Holders pursuant to the terms of the Capital Securities or such other similar interests, as the case may be), including, without limitation, any taxes, duties or other governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed on the Issuer Trust by the United States or any other taxing authority. Such payment obligation includes any such costs, expenses or liabilities of the Issuer Trust that are required by applicable law to be satisfied in connection with a dissolution of the Issuer Trust. Section 4.7 Payments under Indenture or Pursuant to Direct Actions. Any amount payable hereunder to any Holder of Capital Securities (or any Owner with respect thereto) shall be reduced by the amount of any corresponding payment such Holder (or Owner) has directly received pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture or Section 5.14 of this Trust Agreement. ARTICLE V Trust Securities Certificates Section 5.1 Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Issuer Trust and the contribution by the Depositor pursuant to Section 2.3 and until the issuance of the Trust Securities, and at any time during which no Trust Securities are outstanding, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficial owner of the Issuer Trust. Section 5.2 The Trust Securities Certificates. The Capital Securities Certificates shall be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 Liquidation Amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and the Common Securities Certificates shall be issued in denominations of $1,000 Liquidation Amount and integral multiples thereof. The Trust Securities Certificates shall be (i) executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust by manual or facsimile signature of at least one Administrative Trustee and, if executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent and (ii) authenticated by the Property Trustee by manual or facsimile signature of an authorized signatory thereof and, if executed by such authorized signatory of the Property Trustee by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent. Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Issuer Trust or the Property Trustee or, if executed on -24-
behalf of the Issuer Trust or the Property Trustee by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Holder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Sections 5.4, 5.11 and 5.13. Section 5.3 Execution and Delivery of Trust Securities Certificates. At the Time of Delivery, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Trust Securities Certificates, in an aggregate Liquidation Amount as provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, to be executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust and delivered to or upon the written order of the Depositor, executed by one authorized officer thereof, without further corporate action by the Depositor, in authorized denominations. Section 5.4 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of Capital Securities Certificates. The Depositor shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8, a register or registers for the purpose of registering Trust Securities Certificates and transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates (the "Securities Register") in which the transfer agent and registrar designated by the Depositor (the "Securities Registrar"), subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, shall provide for the registration of Capital Securities Certificates and Common Securities Certificates (subject to Section 5.10 in the case of the Common Securities Certificates) and registration of transfers and exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates as herein provided. The Bank shall be the initial Securities Registrar. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Capital Securities Certificate at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them shall execute on behalf of the Issuer Trust (and if executed on behalf of the Issuer Trust by a facsimile signature, such certificate shall be countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent) and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount dated the date of execution by such Administrative Trustee or Trustees. The Securities Registrar shall not be required to register the transfer of any Capital Securities that have been called for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of selection for such redemption. At the option of a Holder, Capital Securities Certificates may be exchanged for other Capital Securities Certificates in authorized denominations of the same class and of a like aggregate Liquidation Amount upon surrender of the Capital Securities Certificates to be exchanged at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.8. -25-
Every Capital Securities Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to an Administrative Trustee and the Securities Registrar duly executed by the Holder of his attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Capital Securities Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and subsequently disposed of by an Administrative Trustee or the Securities Registrar in accordance with such Person's customary practice. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates, but the Securities Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Capital Securities Certificates. Section 5.5 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Trust Securities Certificates. If (a) any mutilated Trust Securities Certificate shall be surrendered to the Securities Registrar, or if the Securities Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Trust Securities Certificate, and (b) there shall be delivered to the Securities Registrar and the Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, on behalf of the Issuer Trust shall execute and make available for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section 5.5, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust corresponding to that evidenced by the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time. Section 5.6 Persons Deemed Holders. The Issuer Trustees and the Securities Registrar shall each treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrative Trustees and the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary. Section 5.7 Access to List of Holders' Names and Addresses. Each Holder and each Owner shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold the Depositor, the Property Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or the Administrative Trustees accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived. -26-
Section 5.8 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Administrative Trustees shall designate an office or offices or agency or agencies where Capital Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer Trustees in respect of the Trust Securities Certificates may be served. The Administrative Trustees initially designate Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), 153 West 51st Street, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, as its office and agency for such purposes. The Administrative Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Depositor, the Property Trustees and to the Holders of any change in the location of the Securities Register or any such office or agency. Section 5.9 Appointment of Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall make Distributions to Holders from the Payment Account and shall report the amounts of such Distributions to the Property Trustee and the Administrative Trustees. Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account solely for the purpose of making the Distributions referred to above. The Property Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent in its sole discretion. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Bank. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days' written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee. If the Bank shall no longer be the Paying Agent or a successor Paying Agent shall resign or its authority to act be revoked, the Property Trustee shall appoint a successor (which shall be a bank or trust company) that is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees to act as Paying Agent. Such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent shall execute and deliver to the Issuer Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Holders in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Holders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee. The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3 and 8.6 herein shall apply to the Bank also in its role as Paying Agent, for so long as the Bank shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise. Section 5.10 Ownership of Common Securities by Depositor. At the Time of Delivery, the Depositor shall acquire, and thereafter shall retain, beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities. To the fullest extent permitted by law, other than a transfer in connection with a consolidation or merger of the Depositor into another Person, or any conveyance, transfer or lease by the Depositor of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Indenture, any attempted transfer of the Common Securities shall be void. The Administrative Trustees shall cause each Common Securities Certificate issued to the Depositor to contain a legend stated "THIS -27-
CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANY PERSON EXCEPT TO THE DEPOSITOR OR AN AFFILIATE OF THE DEPOSITOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW AND SECTION 5.10 OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT." Section 5.11 Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates; Common Securities Certificate. (a) The Capital Securities Certificates, upon original issuance, will be issued in the form of a typewritten Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates representing Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates, to be delivered to DTC, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Issuer Trust. Such Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates shall initially be registered on the Securities Register in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency, and no Owner will receive a Definitive Capital Securities Certificate representing such Owner's interest in such Capital Securities, except as provided in Section 5.13. Unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates have been issued to Owners pursuant to Section 5.13; (i) the provisions of this Section 5.11(a) shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Securities Registrar and the Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Trust Agreement relating to the Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates (including the payment of the Liquidation Amount of and Distributions on the Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates and the giving of instructions or directions to Owners of Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates) as the sole Holder of Capital Securities evidenced by Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates and shall have no obligations to the Owners thereof; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 5.11 conflict with any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Owners of the Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificate shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to the Certificate Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Capital Securities Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 5.13, the initial Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments on the Capital Securities to such Clearing Agency Participants. (b) A single Common Securities Certificate representing the Common Securities shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of a definitive Common Securities Certificate. Section 5.12 Notices to Clearing Agency. To the extent that a notice or other communication to the Holders is required under this Trust Agreement, for so long as Capital Securities are represented by a Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificate, the Administrative Trustees and the Issuer Trustee shall give all such -28-
notices and communications specified herein to be given to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligations to the Owners. Section 5.13 Definitive Capital Securities Certificates. If (a) the Depositor advises the Issuer Trustees in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Capital Securities Certificates, and the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor, (b) the Depositor at its option advises the Issuer Trustees in writing that it elects to terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency or (c) after the occurrence of a Debenture Event of Default, Owners of Capital Securities Certificates representing beneficial interests aggregating at least a majority of the Liquidation Amount advise the Administrative Trustees in writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interest of the Owners of Capital Securities Certificates, then the Administrative Trustees shall notify the other Issuer Trustees and the Clearing Agency, and the Clearing Agency, in accordance with its customary rules and procedures, shall notify all Clearing Agency Participants for whom it holds Capital Securities of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates to Owners of such class or classes, as applicable, requesting the same. Upon surrender to the Administrative Trustees of the typewritten Capital Securities Certificate or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Capital Securities Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Administrative Trustees, or any one of them, shall execute the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency, if executed on behalf of the Trust by facsimile, countersigned by a transfer agent or its agent. Neither the Securities Registrar nor the Issuer Trustees shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Capital Securities Certificates, the Issuer Trustees shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Capital Securities Certificates as Trust Security holders. The Definitive Capital Securities Certificates shall be typewritten, printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Trustees that meets the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Capital Securities are then listed or approved for trading, as evidenced by the execution thereof by the Administrative Trustees or any one of them. Section 5.14 Rights of Holders; Waivers of Past Defaults. (a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.9, and the Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Issuer Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of the Issuer Trust except as described below. The Trust Securities shall be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Trust Agreement. The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights and when issued and delivered to Holders against payment of the purchase price therefor will be fully paid and nonassessable by the Issuer Trust. The Holders of the Trust Securities, in their capacities as -29-
such, shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, if, upon a Debenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the Holders of at least 25% in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee. At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as in the Indenture provided, if the Property Trustee fails to annul any such declaration and waive such default, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Depositor has paid or deposited with the Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue installments of interest on all of the Debentures, (B) any accrued Additional Interest on all of the Debentures, (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee and the Property Trustee, their agents and counsel; and (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13 of the Indenture. The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default under the Indenture, except a default in the payment of principal or interest (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or a default in respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the -30-
holder of each outstanding Debenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. Upon receipt by the Property Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any part of the Capital Securities a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Property Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.14(b). (c) For so long as any Capital Securities remain Outstanding, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the Indenture, upon a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1) or 5.1(2) of the Indenture, any Holder of Capital Securities shall have the right to institute a proceeding directly against the Depositor, pursuant to Section 5.8 of the Indenture, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of any amounts payable in respect of Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action"). Except as set forth in Section 5.14(b) and this Section 5.14(c), the Holders of Capital Securities shall have no right to exercise directly any right or remedy available to the holders of, or in respect of, the Debentures. (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 5.14, the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any default or Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Trust Agreement, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Section 5.15 CUSIP Numbers. The Administrative Trustees in issuing the Capital Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Property Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Capital -31-
Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Capital Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Administrative Trustees will promptly notify the Property Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers. ARTICLE VI Acts of Holders; Meetings; Voting Section 6.1 Limitations on Voting Rights. (a) Except as expressly provided in this Trust Agreement and in the Indenture and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Capital Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Issuer Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Holders from time to time as partners or members of an association. (b) So long as any Debentures are held by the Property Trustee on behalf of the Issuer Trust, the Issuer Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or execute any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past default that may be waived under Section 5.13 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, where such consent shall be required, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Debentures affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent of each Holder of Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities, except by a subsequent vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. The Property Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any notice of default received with respect to the Debentures. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Capital Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Issuer Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that such action shall not cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. (c) If any proposed amendment to the Trust Agreement provides for, or the Issuer Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect in any material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Capital Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Trust Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution and winding-up of the Issuer Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Trust Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Capital Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of -32-
at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Trust Agreement, no amendment to this Trust Agreement may be made if, as a result of such amendment, it would cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. Section 6.2 Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the Holders of the Capital Securities, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 10.8 to each Holder of Capital Securities, at such Holder's registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. Section 6.3 Meetings of Holders of the Capital Securities. No annual meeting of Holders is required to be held. The Property Trustee, however, shall call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Capital Securities and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities to vote on any matters as to which such Holders are entitled to vote. The Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Holders of the Capital Securities. If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Holders present, in person or by proxy, holding Capital Securities representing at least a Majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities held by the Holders present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Holders of the Capital Securities, unless this Trust Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Section 6.4 Voting Rights. Holders shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Outstanding Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Holders are entitled to vote. Section 6.5 Proxies, etc. At any meeting of Holders, any Holder entitled to vote thereat may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Property Trustee, or with such other officer or agent of the Issuer Trust as the Property Trustee may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property -33-
Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Holders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Holder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution. Section 6.6 Holder Action by Written Consent. Any action that may be taken by Holders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Holders holding at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of all Capital Securities entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such larger proportion thereof as shall be required by any other provision of this Trust Agreement) shall consent to the action in writing. Section 6.7 Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes. For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Trust Agreement, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of any meeting of Holders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes. Section 6.8 Acts of Holders. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Property Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 8.1) conclusive in favor of the Issuer Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or -34-
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner that any Issuer Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient. The ownership of Trust Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Trust Security and the Holder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Issuer Trustees, or the Issuer Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security. Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount. If any dispute shall arise between the Holders and the Issuer Trustees or among the Holders or the Issuer Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Holder or Issuer Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter. A Holder may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Depositor under the Guarantee to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Guarantee Trustee (as defined in the Guarantee), the Issuer Trust, any Issuer Trustee, or any person or entity. Section 6.9 Inspection of Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Property Trustee, the records of the Issuer Trust shall be open to inspection by Holders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Holder's interest as a Holder.

Section 7.2 Representations and Warranties of Depositor. The Depositor hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Holders that: (a) the Trust Securities Certificates issued at the Time of Delivery on behalf of the Issuer Trust have been duly authorized and will have been duly and validly executed, issued and delivered by the Issuer Trustees pursuant to the terms and provisions of, and in accordance with the requirements of, this Trust Agreement, and the Holders will be, as of such date, entitled to the benefits of this Trust Agreement; and (b) there are no taxes, fees or other governmental charges payable by the Issuer Trust (or the Issuer Trustees on behalf of the Issuer Trust) under the laws of the State of Delaware or any political subdivision thereof in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by any Issuer Trustee of this Trust Agreement. ARTICLE VIII The Issuer Trustees Section 8.1 Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees shall be as provided by this Trust Agreement, subject to Section 10.10 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require any of the Issuer Trustees to expend or risk its or their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its or their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its or their rights or powers, if it or they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Trust Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Issuer Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.1. Nothing in this Trust Agreement shall be construed to release an Administrative Trustee from liability for his or her own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or his or her own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Administrative Trustee has duties and liabilities relating to the Issuer Trust or to the Holders, such Administrative Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer Trust or to any Holder for such Administrative Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this Trust Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Depositor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Administrative Trustees. (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property and -37-
only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee or a Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Issuer Trustees are not personally liable to such Holder for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.1(b) does not limit the liability of the Issuer Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act. (c) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall enforce this Trust Agreement for the benefit of the Holders. (d) The Property Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and no implied covenants shall be read into this Trust Agreement against the Property Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.14), the Property Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise thereof, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. (e) No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have occurred: (A) the duties and obligations of the Property Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10), and the Property Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement (including pursuant to Section 10.10); and (B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Property Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Trust Agreement; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required to be furnished to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Trust Agreement. -38-
(ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (iii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement; (iv) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such Property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act; (v) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Depositor; and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Account maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.1 and except to the extent otherwise required by law; (vi) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee, the Administrative Trustees or the Depositor; and (vii) Subject to Section 8.1(c), no provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Property Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the Property Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Trust Agreement or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (f) The Administrative Trustees shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the other Issuer Trustees or the Depositor with their respective duties under this Trust Agreement, nor shall either Administrative Trustee be liable for the default or misconduct of any other Issuer Trustee or the Depositor. Section 8.2 Certain Notices. Within ninety days after the occurrence of any Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such Event of Default to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. -39-
Within five Business Days after the receipt of notice of the Depositor's exercise of its right to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.8, notice of such exercise to the Holders and the Administrative Trustees, unless such exercise shall have been revoked. The Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Event of Default unless the Property Trustee shall have received written notice or a Responsible Officer of the Property Trustee charged with the administration of this Trust Agreement shall have obtained actual knowledge of such Event of Default. Section 8.3 Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1: (a) the Property Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) if (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein, or (iii) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the Holders of the Capital Securities are entitled to vote under the terms of this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Depositor requesting the Depositor's opinion as to the course of action to be taken and the Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Holders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any direction or act of the Depositor contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate; (d) any direction or act of an Administrative Trustee contemplated by this Trust Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by a certificate executed by such Administrative Trustee and setting forth such direction or act; (e) the Property Trustee shall have no duty to see to any recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any rerecording, refiling or re-registration thereof; -40-
(f) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel (which counsel may be counsel to the Depositor or any of its Affiliates, and may include any of its employees) and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the Property Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the administration of this Trust Agreement from any court of competent jurisdiction; (g) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; provided that, nothing contained in this Section 8.3(g) shall be taken to relieve the Property Trustee, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Trust Agreement; (h) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but the Property Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit; (i) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or misconduct with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder; (j) whenever in the administration of this Trust Agreement the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders (which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action), (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received, and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and (k) except as otherwise expressly provided by this Trust Agreement, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Trust Agreement. No provision of this Trust Agreement shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligation on any Issuer Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which such Person shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to any Issuer Trustee shall be construed to be a duty. -41-
Section 8.4 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer Trust and the Depositor, and the Issuer Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Issuer Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures. Section 8.5 May Hold Securities. Any Issuer Trustee or any other agent of any Issuer Trustee or the Issuer Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 8.8 and 8.13, and except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, may otherwise deal with the Issuer Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not Issuer Trustee or such other agent. Section 8.6 Compensation; Indemnity; Fees. The Depositor agrees: (a) to pay to the Issuer Trustees from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by them hereunder as may be agreed by the Depositor and the Issuer Trustees from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Issuer Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Issuer Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Trust Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Issuer Trustee, (ii) any Affiliate of any Issuer Trustee, (iii) any officer, director, shareholder, employee, representative or agent of any Issuer Trustee, and (iv) any employee or agent of the Issuer Trust (referred to herein as an "Indemnified Person") from and against any loss, damage, liability, tax, penalty, expense or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of the creation, operation or dissolution of the Issuer Trust or any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Issuer Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Trust Agreement, except that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Indemnified Person by reason of negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions. The provisions of this Section 8.6 shall survive the termination of this Trust Agreement and the removal or resignation of any Issuer Trustee. -42-
No Issuer Trustee may claim any Lien on any Trust Property as a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.6. The Depositor and any Issuer Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Issuer Trust, and the Issuer Trust and the Holders of Trust Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Trust Agreement in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Issuer Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. Neither the Depositor nor any Issuer Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Issuer Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Issuer Trust, could be taken by the Issuer Trust, and the Depositor and any Issuer Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Issuer Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor, or may act as depository for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Depositor or its Affiliates.

The Property Trustee shall be a Person that is a national or state chartered bank and eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.7 and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.7, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article VIII.

(b) The Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture shall be deemed to be specifically described in this Trust Agreement for the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso contained in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.9 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Property Trustee shall have the power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee of any such property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the United States, or (ii) a legal entity with its principal place of business in the United States that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. Should any written instrument from the Depositor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Depositor. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely: (a) The Trust Securities shall be executed by one or more Administrative Trustees, and the Trust Securities shall be delivered by the Property Trustee, and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Property Trustee specified hereunder shall be exercised solely by the Property Trustee and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (b) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or -44-
imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (c) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section 8.9, and, in case a Debenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee without the concurrence of the Depositor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Depositor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigning or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section 8.9. (d) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee or any other trustee hereunder. (e) The Property Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee. (f) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. Section 8.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of any Issuer Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Issuer Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders and by appointing a successor Relevant Trustee. The Relevant Trustee shall appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the Relevant Trustee on a form provided by the Administrative Trustees, and selecting the Person who agrees to the lowest expenses and charges. If the instrument of acceptance by the successor Issuer Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the expense of the, in the case of the Property Trustee, Depositor, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, or both of them, may be removed by Act of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to -45-
the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and, in the case of the Property Trustee, on behalf of the Issuer Trust) (i) for cause (including upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in subparagraph (d) of the definition thereof with respect to the Relevant Trustee), or (ii) if a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at any time. If a resigning Issuer Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if an Issuer Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Issuer Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Issuer Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by Act of the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding delivered to such Relevant Trustee, may appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and such successor Issuer Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of the Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Holder, on behalf of such Holder and all others similarly situated, or any other Issuer Trustee, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The Property Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of an Issuer Trustee and each appointment of a successor Issuer Trustee to all Holders in the manner provided in Section 10.8 and shall give notice to the Depositor and to the Administrative Trustees. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Trust Agreement, if any Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes, in the opinion of the Holders of the Common Securities, incompetent or incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may be filled by the Property Trustee following the procedures regarding expenses and charges set forth above (with the successor being a Person who satisfies the eligibility requirement for the Delaware Trustee set forth in Section 8.7). Section 8.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein each successor Relevant Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (a) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities and the Issuer Trust, and (b) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Trust Agreement as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the Issuer Trust by more than one Relevant Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such Relevant Trustees co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on request of the Issuer Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such -46-
retiring Relevant Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities and the Trust. Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Issuer Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be. No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article VIII. Section 8.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any Person into which the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person, succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article VIII, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. Section 8.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Issuer Trust. If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any other obligor upon the Capital Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Depositor or the Issuer Trust (or any such other obligor).

In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other similar judicial proceeding relative to the Issuer Trust or any other obligor upon the Trust Securities or the property of the Issuer Trust or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Property Trustee (irrespective of whether any Distributions on the Trust Securities shall then be due and payable and irrespective of whether the Property Trustee shall have made any demand on the Issuer Trust for the payment of any past due Distributions) shall be entitled and empowered, to the fullest extent permitted by law, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of any Distributions owing and unpaid in respect of the Trust Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Property Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Property Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and -47-

(b) In addition, the Property Trustee shall transmit to Holders such reports concerning the Property Trustee and its actions under this Trust Agreement as may be required pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner provided pursuant thereto.

ARTICLE IX Dissolution, Liquidation and Merger Section 9.1 Dissolution Upon Expiration Date. -49-
Unless earlier dissolved, the Issuer Trust shall automatically dissolve, and its affairs be wound up, on December 31, 2058 (the "Expiration Date"), following the distribution of the Trust Property in accordance with Section 9.4. Section 9.2 Early Dissolution. The first to occur of any of the following events is an "Early Dissolution Event": (a) the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event in respect of, or the dissolution or liquidation of, the Depositor, in its capacity as the Holder of the Common Securities, unless the Depositor shall transfer the Common Securities as provided by Section 5.10, in which case this provision shall refer instead to any such successor Holder of the Common Securities; (b) the written direction to the Property Trustee from all of the Holders of the Common Securities at any time to dissolve the Issuer Trust and to distribute the Debentures to Holders in exchange for the Capital Securities (which direction is optional and wholly within the discretion of the Holders of the Common Securities); (c) the redemption of all of the Capital Securities in connection with the redemption of all the Debentures; and (d) the entry of an order for dissolution of the Issuer Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction. Section 9.3 Dissolution. The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Issuer Trustees, the Administrative Trustees and the Issuer Trust created and continued hereby shall terminate upon the latest to occur of the following: (a) the distribution by the Property Trustee to Holders of all amounts required to be distributed hereunder upon the liquidation of the Issuer Trust pursuant to Section 9.4, or upon the redemption of all of the Trust Securities pursuant to Section 4.2; (b) the payment of any expenses owed by the Issuer Trust; and (c) the discharge of all administrative duties of the Administrative Trustees, including the performance of any tax reporting obligations with respect to the Issuer Trust or the Holders. Section 9.4 Liquidation. (a) If an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of Section 9.2 occurs or upon the Expiration Date, the Issuer Trust shall be liquidated by the Property Trustee as expeditiously as the Property Trustee determines to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, to each Holder a Like Amount of Debentures, subject to Section 9.4(d). Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All such notices of liquidation shall: -50-
(i) state the CUSIP Number of the Trust Securities; (ii) state the Liquidation Date; (iii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures; and (iv) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Debentures, or if Section 9.4(d) applies, receive a Liquidation Distribution, as the Property Trustee (after consultation with the Administrative Trustees) shall deem appropriate. (b) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, in order to effect the liquidation of the Issuer Trust and distribution of the Debentures to Holders, the Property Trustee, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 30 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates. (c) Except where Section 9.2(c) or 9.4(d) applies, after the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such Certificates to the exchange agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Debentures bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid Distributions on such Trust Securities Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Debentures) and (iv) all rights of Holders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Holders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates. (d) If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.4, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Debentures in the manner provided herein is determined by the Property Trustee not to be practical, or if an Early Dissolution Event specified in clause (c) of Section 9.2 occurs, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Issuer Trust shall be dissolved and its affairs wound-up, by the Property Trustee in such manner as the Property Trustee determines. In such event, on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or other termination of the Issuer Trust, Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Issuer Trust available for distribution to Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Issuer Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If, upon any such dissolution, winding up or termination, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Issuer Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Issuer -51-
Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holders of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Capital Securities, except that, if a Debenture Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(1) or 5.1(2) of the Indenture has occurred and is continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities as provided in Section 4.3. Section 9.5 Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of Issuer Trust. The Issuer Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except pursuant to this Section 9.5. At the request of the Holders of the Common Securities, with the consent of the Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, and without the consent of the Issuer Trustees, the Issuer Trust may merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to a trust organized as such under the laws of any state; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Issuer Trust with respect to the Capital Securities, or (b) substitutes for the Capital Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Capital Securities (the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities have the same priority as the Capital Securities with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is appointed to hold the Debentures, (iii) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Issuer Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the Property Trustee has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Capital Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, neither the Issuer Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act, and (vii) the Depositor or its permitted transferee owns all of the Common Securities of such successor entity and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of all of the Capital Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease would cause the Issuer Trust -52-
or the successor entity to be taxable as a corporation or classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. ARTICLE X Miscellaneous Provisions Section 10.1 Limitation of Rights of Holders. Except as set forth in Section 9.2, the death or incapacity of any person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in Trust Securities shall not operate to terminate this Trust Agreement, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such person or any Holder for such person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. Section 10.2 Amendment.

(b) Except as provided in Section 10.2(c), any provision of this Trust Agreement may be amended by the Administrative Trustees, the Property Trustee, and the Holders of all of the Common Securities and with (i) the consent of Holders of at least a Majority in Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities, and (ii) receipt by the Issuer Trustees of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Trustees or the Administrative Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust's status as a grantor trust or cause the Issuer Trust to be taxable as a corporation or as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes or affect the Issuer Trust's exemption from status as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act. (c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Trust Agreement, without the consent of each affected Holder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this Trust Agreement may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date, or (ii) restrict the right of a Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or -53-
after such date; and notwithstanding any other provision herein, without the unanimous consent of the Holders (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.3 or 6.6 hereof), this paragraph (c) of this Section 10.2 may not be amended. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Trust Agreement, no Issuer Trustee shall enter into or consent to any amendment to this Trust Agreement that would cause the Issuer Trust to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act or to be taxable as a corporation or to be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States Federal income tax purposes. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Trust Agreement to the contrary, without the consent of the Depositor and the Administrative Trustees, this Trust Agreement may not be amended in a manner that imposes any additional obligation on the Depositor or the Administrative Trustees. (f) In the event that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is made, the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee shall promptly provide to the Depositor a copy of such amendment. (g) Neither the Property Trustee nor the Delaware Trustee shall be required to enter into any amendment to this Trust Agreement that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Trust Agreement. The Property Trustee shall be entitled to receive an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate stating that any amendment to this Trust Agreement is in compliance with this Trust Agreement. Section 10.3 Separability. In case any provision in this Trust Agreement or in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Section 10.4 Governing Law. This Trust Agreement and the rights and obligations of each of the Holders, the Issuer Trust, the Depositor, and the Issuer Trustees with respect to this Trust Agreement and the Trust Securities shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to its conflicts of laws provisions. Section 10.5 Payments Due on Non-Business Day. If the date fixed for any payment on any Trust Security shall be a day that is not a Business Day, then such payment need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (except as otherwise provided in Sections 4.1(a) and 4.2(d)), with the same force and effect as though made on the date fixed for such payment, and no Distributions shall accumulate on such unpaid amount for the period after such date. -54-
Section 10.6 Successors. This Trust Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of any successor to the Depositor, the Issuer Trust, and any Issuer Trustee, including any successor by operation of law. Except in connection with a consolidation, merger or sale involving the Depositor that is permitted under Article Eight of the Indenture and pursuant to which the assignee agrees in writing to perform the Depositor's obligations hereunder, the Depositor shall not assign its obligations hereunder.

Exhibit A CERTIFICATE OF TRUST
Exhibit B [FORM OF CERTIFICATE DEPOSITORY AGREEMENT] Letter of Representations [Date] The Depository Trust Company, 55 Water Street, 49th Floor, New York, New York 10041-0099. Attention: General Counsel's Office Re: State Street Capital Trust II Floating Rate Medium Term Capital Securities CUSIP Ladies and Gentlemen: The purpose of this letter is to set forth certain matters relating to the issuance and deposit with The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") of the book-entry-only portion of the Floating Rate Medium Term Capital Securities (the "Capital Securities"), of State Street Capital Trust II, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Issuer"), governed by the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003, among State Street Corporation (the "Corporation"), as Depositor, Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Property Trustee, and Bank One Delaware, Inc., as Delaware Trustee. The payment of distributions on the Capital Securities and payments due upon liquidation of the Issuer or redemption of the Capital Securities, to the extent the Issuer has funds available for the payment thereof, are guaranteed by the Corporation to the extent set forth in a Guarantee Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003, between the Corporation and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), as Guarantee Trustee with respect to the Capital Securities. The Corporation and the Issuer propose to sell the Capital Securities to the several underwriters (the "Underwriters") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated January 14, 2003, by and among Goldman, Sachs & Co., as representative of the Underwriters, the Issuer and the Corporation, and the Underwriters wish to take delivery of the Capital Securities through DTC. Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago) is acting as transfer agent and registrar with respect to the Capital Securities (the "Transfer Agent and Registrar").
To induce DTC to accept the Capital Securities as eligible for deposit at DTC, and to act in accordance with DTC's rules with respect to the Capital Securities, the Issuer and the Transfer Agent and Registrar make the following representations to DTC: (a) Prior to the closing of the sale of the Capital Securities to the Underwriters on January 21, 2003, there shall be deposited with, or held by the Transfer Agent and Registrar as custodian for, DTC one or more global certificates (individually and collectively, the "Global Certificate") registered in the name of DTC's nominee, Cede & Co., representing an aggregate of 345,000 Capital Securities and bearing the following legend: Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation ("DTC"), to Issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein. (b) The Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Issuer provides for the voting by holders (with no provision for revocation of consents or votes by subsequent holders) of the Capital Securities under certain limited circumstances. The Issuer shall establish a record date for such purposes and shall, to the extent possible, give DTC notice of such record date not less than 15 calendar days in advance of such record date. (c) In the event of a stock split, conversion, recapitalization, reorganization or any other similar transaction resulting in the cancellation of all or any part of the Capital Securities outstanding, the Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall send DTC a notice of such event as soon as possible but, at least 5 business days prior to the effective date of such event. (d) In the event of any distribution on, or an offering or issuance of rights with respect to, the Capital Securities outstanding, the Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall send DTC a notice specifying: (a) the amount of and conditions, if any, applicable to the payment of any such distribution or any such offering or issuance of rights; (b) any applicable expiration or deadline date, or any date by which any action on the part of the holders of Capital Securities is required; and (c) the date any required notice is to be mailed by or on behalf of the Issuer to holders of Capital Securities or published by or on behalf of the Issuer (whether by mail or publication, the "Publication Date"). Such notice shall be sent to DTC by a secure means (e.g., legible telecopy, registered or certified mail, overnight delivery) in a timely manner designed to assure that such notice is in DTC's possession no later than the close of business on the business day before the Publication Date. The Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar will forward such notice either in a separate secure transmission for each CUSIP number or in a
secure transmission of multiple CUSIP numbers (if applicable) that includes a manifest or list of each CUSIP number submitted in that transmission. (The party sending such notice shall have a method to verify subsequently the use of such means and the timeliness of such notice.) The Publication Date shall be not less than 30 calendar days nor more than 60 calendar days prior to the payment of any such distribution or any such offering or issuance of rights with respect to the Capital Securities. After establishing the amount of payment to be made on the Capital Securities, the Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar will notify DTC's Dividend Department of such payment 5 business days prior to payment date. Notices to DTC's Dividend Department by telecopy shall be sent to (212) 709-1723. Such notices by mail or by any other means shall be sent to: Manager, Announcements Dividend Department The Depository Trust Company 7 Hanover Square, 23rd Floor New York, New York 10004-2695 The Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall confirm DTC's receipt of such telecopy by telephoning the Dividend Department at (212) 709-1270. (e) In the event of a redemption by the Issuer of the Capital Securities, notice specifying the terms of the redemption and the Publication Date of such notice shall be sent by the Issuer or the Transfer Agent and Registrar to DTC not less than 30 calendar days prior to such event by a secure means in the manner set forth in paragraph 4.

which the Guarantee Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation.

If such corporation -11-
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section 4.1 and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

Such court may thereupon, after prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, appoint a Successor Guarantee Trustee. (e) If a resigning Guarantee Trustee shall fail to appoint a successor, or if a Guarantee Trustee shall be removed or become incapable of acting as Guarantee Trustee and a replacement -12-
shall not be appointed prior to such resignation or removal, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Guarantee Trustee for any cause, the Holders of the Capital Securities, by the action of the Holders of record of not less than 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Capital Securities then Outstanding (as defined in the Trust Agreement) delivered to such Guarantee Trustee, may appoint a Successor Guarantee Trustee or Trustees.

ARTICLE V Guarantee Section 5.1. Guarantee. The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay in full to the Holders the Guarantee Payments (without duplication of amounts theretofore paid by or on behalf of the Issuer Trust), as and when due, regardless of any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim that the Issuer Trust may have or assert, except the defense of payment. The Guarantor's obligation to make a Guarantee Payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required amounts by the Guarantor to the Holders or by causing the Issuer Trust to pay such amounts to the Holders.

Capital Securities or the extension of time for the performance of any other obligation under, arising out of, or in connection with, the Capital Securities; (c) any failure, omission, delay or lack of diligence on the part of the Holders to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on the Holders pursuant to the terms of the Capital Securities, or any action on the part of the Issuer Trust granting indulgence or extension of any kind; (d) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition or readjustment of debt of, or other similar proceedings affecting, the Issuer Trust or any of the assets of the Issuer Trust; (e) any invalidity of, or defect or deficiency in, the Capital Securities; (f) the settlement or compromise of any obligation guaranteed hereby or hereby incurred; or (g) any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor (other than payment of the underlying obligation), it being the intent of this Section 5.3 that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. There shall be no obligation of the Holders to give notice to, or obtain the consent of, the Guarantor with respect to the happening of any of the foregoing. Section 5.4. Rights of Holders.

Section 5.6. Subrogation. The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Holders against the Issuer Trust in respect of any amounts paid to the Holders by the Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall not (except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law) be entitled to enforce or exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation or any indemnity, reimbursement or other agreement, in all cases as a result of payment under this Guarantee Agreement, if, at the time of any such payment, any amounts are due and unpaid under this Guarantee Agreement. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, the Guarantor agrees to hold such amount in trust for the Holders and to pay over such amount to the Holders. Section 5.7. Independent Obligations. The Guarantor acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of the Issuer Trust with respect to the Capital Securities and that the Guarantor shall be liable as principal and as debtor hereunder to make Guarantee Payments pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee Agreement notwithstanding the occurrence of any event referred to in subsections (a) through (g), inclusive, of Section 5.3 hereof. ARTICLE VI Covenants and Subordination Section 6.1. Subordination. The obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement will constitute unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and will rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) of the Guarantor to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Indenture with respect to the Debentures, and the provisions of Article XIII of the Indenture will apply, mutatis mutandis, to the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder do not constitute Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) of the Guarantor. Section 6.2. Pari Passu Guarantees.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guarantee Agreement will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any Holder is required to repay any sums paid with respect to Capital Securities or this Guarantee Agreement. ARTICLE VIII Miscellaneous Section 8.1. Successors and Assigns. All guarantees and agreements contained in this Guarantee Agreement shall bind the successors, assigns, receivers, trustees and representatives of the Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Holders of the Capital Securities then outstanding.

Exhibit 4.27 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE dated as of January 21, 2003 to JUNIOR SUBORDINATED INDENTURE dated as of December 15, 1996 between STATE STREET CORPORATION as Issuer and BANK ONE TRUST COMPANY, N.A. as Indenture Trustee FlOATING RATE MEDIUM TERM JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2008 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE This FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE, dated as of January 21, 2003 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), to the Indenture, dated as of December 15, 1996, is made between STATE STREET CORPORATION, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Corporation"), and BANK ONE TRUST COMPANY, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank of Chicago), a national banking association (the "Trustee"). All capitalized terms used in this First Supplemental Indenture and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given such terms in the Original Indenture (as defined below). W I T N E S S E T H : WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Trustee entered into an indenture, dated as of December 15, 1996 (the "Original Indenture"), pursuant to which one or more series of unsecured junior subordinated debt securities of the Corporation (the "Securities") may be issued from time to time; and WHEREAS, Section 3.1 of the Original Indenture permits the terms of any Securities to be established in a supplemental indenture to the Original Indenture; and WHEREAS, Section 9.1 of the Original Indenture provides that a supplemental indenture may be entered into by the Corporation and Trustee, without the consent of any Holders of Securities, to establish the form and terms of the Securities of any series and to change any of the provisions of the Original Indenture, provided that such change does not apply to any Outstanding Securities; and WHEREAS, the Corporation has requested the Trustee to join with it in the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture in order to supplement and amend the Original Indenture by, among other things, establishing the form and terms of one series of Securities to be known as the Corporation's "Floating Rate Medium Term Junior Subordinated Debentures" (the "Debentures") and amending certain provisions thereof; and WHEREAS, State Street Capital Trust II, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), intends to offer to the public $345,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of its Floating Rate Medium Term Capital Securities, representing an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust (the "Medium Term Capital Securities"), and proposes to invest the proceeds from such offering, together with the proceeds of the sale of $10,670,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust's common securities to the Corporation, in up to $355,670,000 aggregate principal amount of the Debentures; and WHEREAS, concurrently with the offering of the Medium Term Capital Securities, the Corporation intends to offer to the public $345,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of its SPACES, which are equity security units (the "SPACES"); and
WHEREAS, the Corporation and the Trustee desire to enter into this First Supplemental Indenture for the purposes set forth in Sections 3.1 and 9.1 of the Original Indenture as referred to above; and WHEREAS, all necessary actions to make this First Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Corporation and the Trustee and a valid supplement to the Original Indenture have been duly taken, NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties to this First Supplemental Indenture mutually covenant and agree as follows: ARTICLE I. Designation and Terms of Debentures 1.1 Establishment of Series. There is hereby created a series of Securities to be known and designated as the Floating Rate Medium Term Junior Subordinated Debentures, to be in substantially the form and with the terms set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, subject to changes in the form thereof made by the Corporation and acceptable to the Trustee, and which shall be subordinated and junior to all Senior Indebtedness of the Corporation. For purposes of the Original Indenture, the Debentures shall constitute a single series of Securities. 1.2 Limit on Aggregate Principal Amount. The aggregate principal amount of Debentures that may be issued under this First Supplemental Indenture is limited to $355,670,000. 1.3 Maturity. The Stated Maturity for the payment of principal of the Debentures is February 15, 2008. 1.4 Interest. The Debentures will bear interest, accruing from the date of initial issuance, at a variable annual rate equal to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus 0.50% (the "Interest Rate") of the principal amount thereof, payable quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto) in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing May 15, 2003. "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered rate for three-month, U.S. dollar deposits and, with respect to any period of time beginning on any Interest Payment Date (or the date of issuance of the Debentures, in the case of the first Interest Period) and ending on the day immediately preceding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (an "Interest Period"), will be calculated by Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), as follows: (a) On the second Market Day (as defined below) preceding the commencement of such Interest Period (each, a "Determination Date"), 3-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the offered rate for deposits of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 for a period of three months (the "Index Maturity"), commencing on the second Market Day immediately -2-
preceding the commencement of such Interest Period, which appears on the display designated as Page 3750 on the Dow Jones Telerate Service (or such other pages as may replace Page 3750 on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks) ("Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m., London time on said Determination Date. If no such offered rate appears, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to such Interest Period will be determined as described in (b) below; (b) With respect to a Determination Date on which no such offered rate appears on Telerate Page 3750 as described in (a) above, 3-Month LIBOR shall be the arithmetic mean, expressed as a percentage, of the offered rates (unless by its terms such display provides for only a single rate, in which case a single rate shall be used) for deposits in U.S. dollars for the Index Maturity that appears on the display designated as "LIBO" on the Reuters Monitor Money Market Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on that service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks) ("Reuters Screen LIBO Page") as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such date. If, in turn, at least two such rates are not displayed on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page at such time (unless, as aforesaid, only a single rate is required), the Calculation Agent will obtain from each of four reference banks in London selected by the Calculation Agent ("Reference Banks") such bank's offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such date for deposits in U.S. dollars to prime banks in the London interbank market for the Index Maturity. If two or more such quotations are provided as requested, then 3-Month LIBOR for such date shall be the arithmetic average of such quotations. If, in turn, fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, then 3-Month LIBOR for such date will be obtained from the preceding Market Day for which the Telerate Page 3750 displayed a rate for the Index Maturity; and (c) If on any Determination Date, the Calculation Agent is required but unable to determine 3-Month LIBOR in the manner provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, 3-Month LIBOR for such Interest Period shall be 3-Month LIBOR as determined on the previous Determination Date. The term "Market Day" means any Business Day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets are open for business (including dealings in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in New York and London. The Interest Rate for any Interest Period will at no time be higher than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified by United States law. All percentages resulting from any calculations referred to in the Indenture will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a percentage point, with five hundred-thousandths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 6.87655% (or .0687655) would be rounded to 6.8766% (or ..068766)), and all U.S. dollar amounts used in or -3-
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards). The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date, determine 3-Month LIBOR and inform the Trustee. Unless otherwise provided by the Trustee, the Paying Agent will calculate the amount of interest payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the "Interest Amount"). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Interest Rate to the principal amount of each Debenture outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such principal amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned (which actual number of days shall include the first day but exclude the last day of such Interest Period) divided by 360 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards). The determination of the Interest Rate by the Calculation Agent and the Interest Amount by the Paying Agent will (in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error) be final, conclusive and binding on all concerned. None of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Trust or the Corporation (or any of their respective officers, directors, agents, beneficiaries, employees or affiliates) shall have any liability to any Person for (i) the selection of any Reference Bank or (ii) any inability to retain major banks in the London interbank market, in the case of the Calculation Agent, which is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Upon the request of a holder of a Debenture, the Calculation Agent will provide the Interest Rate then in effect and, if determined, the Interest Rate for the next Interest Period with respect to the Debentures. Each such Interest Rate may be obtained by telephoning the Calculation Agent. Interest will include Additional Sums, if any, as provided in Section 10.6 of the Indenture until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment; provided that any overdue principal, premium or Additional Sums and any overdue installment of interest shall bear Additional Interest at the Interest Rate (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), compounded quarterly, from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date, except as provided below. In the event that the Debentures are in book-entry only form, the Regular Record Date for each Interest Payment Date shall be the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a -4-
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. 1.5 Deferral of Interest Payments. The Corporation shall have the right, pursuant to Section 3.12 of the Original Indenture, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures on the terms set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto. 1.6 Fixed Early Redemption. On December 15, 2005 (the "Fixed Early Redemption Date"), the Corporation shall redeem all outstanding Debentures, in whole but not in part, provided that (i) the Corporation is "well-capitalized" for purposes of the then applicable provisions of Regulation Y of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") and otherwise complies with the then applicable provisions of the then applicable capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board and (ii) the Federal Reserve Board consents to such redemption. The Corporation shall make a good faith effort to determine whether it meets the conditions set forth in clause (i) above based on the Corporation's unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2005. If the Corporation determines that it has met such conditions, the Corporation shall seek consent from the Federal Reserve Board to the redemption of the Debentures on the Fixed Early Redemption Date. If the Federal Reserve Board consents to such redemption, the Corporation (or, at the Corporation's request, the Trustee) shall provide notice of such redemption to the Property Trustee under the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement (as defined below) no later than thirty-five (35) days and no earlier than sixty-five (65) days prior to the Fixed Early Redemption Date. Any redemption on the Fixed Early Redemption Date shall be at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures, together with accrued interest, including any Additional Interest, to, but excluding, the Fixed Early Redemption Date. 1.7 Special Event Redemption. Subject to the Corporation having received prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board if then required under applicable law, rules, guidelines or policies of the Federal Reserve Board, the Corporation shall have the right to redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, subject to the terms and conditions of Article XI of the Indenture, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence and during the continuation of a Tax Event, Investment Company Event or Capital Treatment Event (or, if the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is then required for such redemption, on such later date as promptly as practicable after such approval is obtained), in either case, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders and upon the provision of notice of such redemption by the Corporation to the Property Trustee under the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement no later than forty-five (45) days prior to such redemption date, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures, plus accrued interest, including any Additional Interest, to the redemption date. -5-

Solely for purposes of the Debentures, the definition of "Capital Treatment Event" in Section 1.1 of the Original Indenture shall not apply, and the following definition shall instead be applicable: "Capital Treatment Event" means the reasonable determination by the Corporation (as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) that, as a result of any amendment to, or change (including any proposed change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, or as a result of any official or administrative pronouncement or action or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment or change is effective or which proposed change, pronouncement, action or decision is announced on or after the date of issuance of the Medium Term Capital Securities, there is more than an insubstantial risk that, taking into consideration the terms of the Medium Term Capital Securities and the terms of the SPACES, the Corporation will not be entitled to treat an amount equal to the aggregate Liquidation Amount (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement) of the Medium Term Capital Securities as "Tier 1 Capital" (or the then equivalent thereof) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as then in effect and applicable to the Corporation." 1.9 State Street Capital Trust II. The forms of (a) the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust (the "Amended and Restated Trust Agreement") among the Corporation, Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Property Trustee, Bank One Delaware, Inc., as Delaware Trustee, the Administrative Trustees named therein and the holders of Trust Securities (as defined therein) and (b) the Guarantee Agreement between the Corporation and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Guarantee Trustee, relating to the Trust are attached hereto as Exhibit B and Exhibit C, respectively. 1.10 Global Securities. If the Debentures are distributed to holders of Medium Term Capital Securities in connection with the involuntary or voluntary dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the Trust, the Debentures will be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee and will be subject to the relevant provisions of the Indenture, including without limitation Section 3.5 thereof. 1.11 Definition of Senior Indebtedness. Solely for purposes of the Debentures, clauses (b), (e) and (f) of the definition of "Senior Indebtedness" in Section 1.1 of the Original Indenture shall not apply, and the following clauses (b) and (e) shall instead be applicable: "(b) any Debt of the Corporation to any of its Subsidiaries, other than Subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended," "(e) any Debt which by its terms is subordinated to trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business to the extent that payments made to the holders of such Debt by the holders of the Debentures as a result of the subordination provisions of this Indenture would be greater than such payments otherwise would have -6-
been as a result of any obligation of such holders of such Debt to pay amounts over to the obligees on such trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business as a result of subordination provisions to which such Debt is subject." 1.12 Representations and Warranties. In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Corporation hereby represents and warrants that as of the date of this Supplemental Indenture, the Corporation is not obligated in respect of any Debt for borrowed money from (i) any Subsidiary that is not a bank or bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or (ii) any employee of the Corporation, except, in each case, (x) in respect of Debt on which the Corporation shall defer payments of principal, interest and premium to the same extent that the Corporation defers payments of interest on the Debentures; or (y) in the ordinary course of business. 1.13 Additional Covenants. Solely for purposes of the Debentures, the following new Sections 10.9 and 10.10 of the Original Indenture shall be applicable: "Section 10.9 Indebtedness to Certain Subsidiaries. Except in the ordinary course of business, the Corporation shall not incur Debt for borrowed money from any Subsidiary that is not a bank or bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, unless, pursuant to the terms of such Debt, the Corporation defers payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, in respect of such Debt to the same extent that the Corporation defers payments of interest on the Debentures. Section 10.10 Debt to Employees. Except in the ordinary course of business, the Corporation shall not incur Debt for borrowed money from any employee of the Corporation, unless, pursuant to the terms of such Debt, the Corporation defers payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, in respect of such Debt to the same extent that the Corporation defers payments of interest on the Debentures." 1.14 Events of Default. Solely for purposes of the Debentures, clause (3) of the definition of "Event of Default" set forth in Section 5.1 of the Original Indenture shall be inapplicable. ARTICLE II.

STATE STREET CORPORATION Floating Rate Medium Term Junior Subordinated Debenture No. F-1 $355,670,000 STATE STREET CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (hereinafter called the "Corporation", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Property Trustee for State Street Capital Trust II, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, or registered assigns, the principal sum of Three Hundred Fifty-Five Million Six Hundred Seventy Thousand Dollars ($355,670,000) on February 15, 2008. The Corporation further promises to pay interest on said principal sum from January 21, 2003 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, commencing May 15, 2003 (each, an "Interest Payment Date") at a variable annual rate equal to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus 0.50% (the "Interest Rate"). "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered rate for three-month, U.S. dollar deposits and, with respect to the period beginning on, and including, the date of original issuance of this Security, and ending on, but excluding, the first Interest Payment Date, and each successive period beginning on, and including, any Interest Payment Date, and ending on, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (each such period, an "Interest Period"), will be calculated by Bank One Trust Company, N.A. as calculation agent, as provided in the Indenture. Interest will include Additional Sums, if any, as provided in Section 10.6 of the Indenture until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment; provided that any overdue principal, premium or Additional Sums and any overdue installment of interest shall bear Additional Interest at the Interest Rate (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), compounded quarterly, from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on demand. The amount of interest payable for any period shall be computed by applying the Interest Rate on the principal amount of this Security outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such principal amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned (which actual number of days shall include the first day but exclude the last day of such Interest Period) divided by 360 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards). The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which shall be the fifteenth day (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Corporation shall have the right, at any time during the term of this Security, from time to time to defer the payment of interest on this Security for up to 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods with respect to each deferral period (each an "Extension Period") at the end of which the Corporation shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid including any Additional Interest, as provided below; provided, however, that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security and no such Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date; and provided, further, however, that during any such Extension Period, the Corporation shall not (i) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Corporation that rank pari passu in all respects with or junior in interest to this Security, or (ii) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Corporation's capital stock (other than (a) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Corporation in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of capital stock of the Corporation (or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Extension Period, (b) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock (or any capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation) for any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock or of any class or series of the Corporation's indebtedness for any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Corporation's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any Rights Plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any Rights Plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, or (e) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks pari passu with or junior to such stock). Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Corporation may further defer the payment of interest, provided that no Extension Period shall exceed 20 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods, extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the principal of this Security or end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any Additional Interest then due on any Interest Payment Date, the Corporation may elect to begin a new Extension Period, subject to the above conditions. No interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have been due and payable during such Extension shall bear
Additional Interest (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the Interest Rate, compounded quarterly and calculated as set forth in the first paragraph of this Security, from the dates on which amounts would otherwise have been due and payable until paid or made available for payment. The Corporation shall give the Holder of this Security and the Trustee notice of its election to begin any Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date on which interest on this Security would be payable but for such deferral or, so long as such Securities are held by State Street Capital Trust II (the "Issuer Trust"), at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Capital Securities of such Issuer Trust would be payable but for such deferral, and (ii) the date on which the Property Trustee of such Issuer Trust is required to give notice to holders of such Capital Securities of the record date or the date such Distributions are payable. Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained for that purpose in New York, New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Corporation payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register, or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified by the Securities Register. The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided, and (c) appoints the Trustee his or her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his or her acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal. Dated: January 21, 2003 [SEAL] State Street Corporation By: ___________________________________ Name: Title: Attest: ___________________________ TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture. Dated: January 21, 2003 Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee By: ____________________________________ Authorized officer
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Corporation (herein called the "Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 15, 1996, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 21, 2003 (as previously supplemented and amended, and as further amended or supplemented, "Indenture"), between the Corporation and Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (as successor in interest to The First National Bank Of Chicago), as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Corporation, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $355,670,000. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture or in the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003 (as modified, amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Trust Agreement"), relating to State Street Capital Trust II (the "Issuer Trust"), among the Corporation, as Depositor, the Trustees named therein and the Holders from time to time of the Trust Securities issued pursuant thereto, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture or the Trust Agreement, as the case may be. On December 15, 2005 (the "Fixed Early Redemption Date"), the Company shall redeem this Security, in whole but not in part, provided that (i) the Company is "well-capitalized" for purposes of the then applicable provisions of Regulation Y of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") and otherwise complies with the then applicable provisions of the then applicable capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board and (ii) the Federal Reserve Board consents to such redemption. The Company shall make a good faith effort to determine whether it meets the conditions set forth in clause (i) above based on the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2005. If the Company determines that it has met such conditions, the Company shall seek consent from the Federal Reserve Board to the redemption of the Securities on the Fixed Early Redemption Date. If the Federal Reserve Board consents to such redemption, the Company (or, at the Company's request, the Trustee) shall provide notice of such redemption to the Property Trustee under the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement no later than thirty-five (35) days prior to the Fixed Early Redemption Date. Any redemption on the Fixed Early Redemption Date shall be at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof, together with accrued interest, including any Additional Interest, to, but excluding, the Fixed Early Redemption Date. Subject to the Corporation having received prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board if then required under applicable law, rules, guidelines or policies of the Federal Reserve Board, the Corporation shall have the right to redeem this Security in whole, but not in part, subject to the terms and conditions of Article XI of the Indenture, at any time within 90 days following the occurrence and during the continuation of a Tax Event, Investment Company Event or Capital Treatment Event (or, if the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is then required for such
redemption, on such later date as promptly as practicable after such approval is obtained), in either case, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount hereof, plus accrued interest, including any Additional Interest, to the redemption date. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction and discharge of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Corporation with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Corporation and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Corporation and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Corporation with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of this series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Corporation (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), provided that, if upon an Event of Default, the Trustee or such Holders fail to declare the principal of all the Outstanding Securities of this series to be immediately due and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Capital Securities then Outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing to the Corporation and the Trustee; and upon any such declaration the principal amount of and the accrued interest (including any Additional Interest) on all the Securities of this series shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article XIII of the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Corporation, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Corporation maintained under Section 10.2 of the Indenture for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Corporation may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Corporation, the Trustee and any agent of the Corporation or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Corporation, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Corporation and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Security agree that for United States Federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness. This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

(a) In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. (b) Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous. Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Agreement, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. SECTION 1.4. ACTS OF HOLDERS; RECORD DATES. (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Agent and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 7.1) conclusive in favor of the Agent and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Agent deems sufficient. 15
(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the SPACES Register, the Separate PACES Register or the Separate COVERS Register, as the case may be. (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Certificate shall bind every future Holder of the same Certificate and the Holder of every Certificate issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefore or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Certificate. (e) The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action with respect to the Securities, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Securities on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be canceled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Securities on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Agent in writing and to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section 1.6. (f) With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the Company may designate any date as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the Agent in writing, and to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section 1.6, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the Company shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. SECTION 1.5. NOTICES. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Agreement to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with: (a) the Agent by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered 16
by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, telecopy: (212) 373-1384, or at any other address furnished in writing by the Agent to the Holders and the Company; or (b) the Company by the Agent or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the Company at State Street Corporation, 225 Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, Attention: General Counsel, telecopy: (617) 664-4747, or at any other address furnished in writing to the Agent by the Company; or (c) the Collateral Agent by the Agent, the Company or any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing and personally delivered, mailed, first-class postage prepaid, telecopied or delivered by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, addressed to the Collateral Agent at 153 West 51st Street, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, telecopy: (212) 373-1384 or at any other address furnished in writing by the Collateral Agent to the Agent, the Company and the Holders. SECTION 1.6. NOTICE TO HOLDERS; WAIVER. (a) Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at its address as it appears in the applicable Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. (b) In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Agent shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.7. EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.8. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and agreements in this Agreement by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. 17

Nothing in this Agreement or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and, to the extent provided hereby, the Holders, any benefits or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement. The Holders from time to time shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions hereof and of the Securities evidenced by their Certificates by their acceptance of delivery of such Certificates.

(a) In any case where any Payment Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Certificates) payments on the Treasury Portfolio or the payment of Contract Payments shall not be made on such date, but such payments shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date, provided that no interest or additional payment shall accrue or be payable by the Company for the period from and after any such Payment Date, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date. (b) In any case where the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date shall not be a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Certificates), the Contracts shall not be performed on such date, but the Contracts shall be performed on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if performed on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable. SECTION 1.13. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Contracts, by giving notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 1.5 hereof. Any such appointment shall not relieve the Company in any way from its obligations hereunder. SECTION 1.16. NO WAIVER. No failure on the part of the Company, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. ARTICLE II CERTIFICATE FORMS SECTION 2.1. FORMS OF CERTIFICATES GENERALLY.

(d) No Contract evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized signatory of the Agent, as such Holder's attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized signatory of the Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Contracts evidenced by such Certificate. 22
(e) Each Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication.

(c) At the option of the Holder, Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates, of like tenor and denominations and evidencing a like number of SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, as the case may be, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. (d) All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations, under this Agreement as the SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. (e) Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. (f) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.6, 3.9 and 8.5 not involving any transfer.

Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.9.

The Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers among Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments of Contract Payments to such Clearing Agency Participants. SECTION 3.7. NOTICES TO HOLDERS. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Securities registered in the name of a Clearing Agency or the nominee of a Clearing Agency, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners. SECTION 3.8. APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR CLEARING AGENCY. If any Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Securities, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Clearing Agency with respect to the Securities. 25
SECTION 3.9. DEFINITIVE CERTIFICATES.

The Company shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. SECTION 3.10. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN CERTIFICATES.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Agent, and the Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver any Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earlier of the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, and the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Agent shall (i) in the case of SPACES or Separate PACES, if the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts forming a part of the SPACES or Separate PACES evidenced by such Certificate, or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, transfer the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Common Stock, as the case may be, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article V. 26
(d) Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Agent) connected therewith. (e) Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Securities evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Securities evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. (f) The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. SECTION 3.11. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. (a) Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company, the Agent and its Affiliates, and any agent of the Company or the Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered on the Register as the owner of the Securities evidenced thereby for the purpose of receiving quarterly payments on the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, receiving payments of Contract Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Payments, performance of the Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Agent, such Affiliates nor any agent of the Company, the Agent or such Affiliates, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Agent or any agent of the Company or the Agent, from treating the Clearing Agency as the sole Holder of such Global Certificate or from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any Clearing Agency (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate or impair, as between such Clearing Agency and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Certificate, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of such Clearing Agency (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. SECTION 3.12. CANCELATION. (a) All Certificates surrendered (i) for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after any Settlement Date; (ii) upon the transfer of the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Common Stock, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event; or (iii) upon the registration of a transfer or exchange of a Security shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Agent, be delivered to the Agent and, if not already canceled, shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Agent for cancelation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon Issuer Order, be promptly canceled by the Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on 27
behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All canceled Certificates held by the Agent shall upon written request be returned to the Company. (b) If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancelation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is delivered to the Agent canceled or for cancelation. SECTION 3.13. SPLITTING APART SPACES. (a) A Holder may separate the PACES from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract in respect of the SPACES held by such Holder by substituting for the Pledged Fixed-Share Right securing such Holder's obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract (a "Collateral Substitution"). A Holder may effectuate a Collateral Substitution, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) and (ii) transferring the related SPACES to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Common Stock to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Fixed-Share Right underlying such SPACES, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto. Upon receipt of the Common Stock described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release such Pledged Fixed-Share Right from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon notification of such release the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related SPACES; and (ii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Separate PACES Certificate and a Separate COVERS Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of PACES and Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled SPACES. (b) Holders who elect to separate the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts and to substitute Common Stock for such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. (c) In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the SPACES or fails to deliver a SPACES Certificate to the Agent after depositing Common Stock with the Collateral Agent, the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights constituting a part of such SPACES, and any distributions on such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit 28
of such Holder, until such SPACES are so transferred or the SPACES Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a SPACES Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such SPACES Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. (d) Except as described in this Section 3.13, for so long as the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying a SPACES remains in effect, such SPACES shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such SPACES in respect of such constituent parts may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a SPACES, subject to the pledge of the Fixed-Share Right pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Pledge Agreement. SECTION 3.14. RE-CREATING SPACES. (a) A Holder of Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may re-create SPACES, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) pledging to the Collateral Agent the Fixed-Share Rights relating to such number of Separate PACES as is equal to such Separate COVERS and (ii) transferring such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, stating that the Holder has pledged the relevant number of Fixed-Share Rights to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto. Upon receipt of the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Rights described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Common Stock, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Separate PACES and Separate COVERS; (ii) transfer the Pledged Common Stock to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a SPACES Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 evidencing the same number of Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled Separate PACES and Separate COVERS. (b) Except as provided in this Section 3.14, Separate PACES and Separate COVERS shall not be available for re-creating SPACES, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, including the Collateral related thereto. SECTION 3.15. TRANSFER OF COLLATERAL AND OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO UPON OCCURRENCE OF TERMINATION EVENT. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Agent of the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips or the Common Stock, as the case may be, underlying 29
the SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and/or such Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips or Common Stock, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request, substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto, mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the SPACES Register, the Separate PACES Register or the Separate COVERS Register, as the case may be. Upon book-entry transfer of the SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS or delivery of a SPACES Certificate, Separate PACES Certificate or Separate COVERS Certificate to the Agent with such transfer instructions, the Agent shall transfer the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and/or the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips or Common Stock, as the case may be, underlying such SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions. In the event a Holder of SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and/or the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips or Common Stock, as the case may be, underlying such SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS are transferred or the SPACES Certificate, Separate PACES Certificate or Separate COVERS Certificate is surrendered or such Holder provides satisfactory evidence that such SPACES Certificate, Separate PACES Certificate or Separate COVERS Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. In the case of the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips, the Agent may dispose of the subject securities for cash and pay the applicable portion of such cash to the Holders in lieu of any Treasury securities, where such Holder would otherwise have been entitled to receive less than $1,000 principal amount of such security. SECTION 3.16. NO CONSENT TO ASSUMPTION. Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance thereof, will be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the applicable Contracts by the Company, its trustee in bankruptcy, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. ARTICLE IV TREASURY SECURITIES; PLEDGED COMMON STOCK SECTION 4.1. QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS; RIGHTS TO DISTRIBUTIONS PRESERVED. (a) A distribution on any Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio which is paid on any Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name the SPACES Certificate (or one or more Predecessor SPACES Certificates) or the Separate PACES Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Separate PACES Certificates) of which such Ownership Interest is a part is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. 30
(b) In the case of any SPACES or Separate PACES with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is effected in other than integral multiples of 1,000 related SPACES or Separate PACES, notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be, distributions on the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio otherwise payable on future Payment Dates shall be payable on such future Payment Dates, to the extent treasury strips underlying the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio are not distributed to the Holder as provided herein, and such distributions shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the SPACES Certificate (or one or more Predecessor SPACES Certificates) or Separate PACES Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Separate PACES Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding the Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, as applicable. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any SPACES or Separate PACES with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is effected, distributions on the related Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio that would otherwise be payable after the applicable Settlement Date shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such SPACES or Separate PACES. SECTION 4.2. DISTRIBUTIONS; NOTICE AND VOTING. (a) Subject to the terms hereof and the terms of the Pledge Agreement, any distribution made by the Company on Pledged Common Stock underlying a Separate COVERS shall, subject to the receipt thereof by the Agent, be distributed by the Agent to the Holder of such Separate COVERS on the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution; provided that any such distributions received by the Agent prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, shall be distributed by the Agent to Holders on the day received by the Agent, and that any such distributions received by the Agent at or after 1:00 p.m., New York City time, shall be distributed by the Agent to Holders on the following Business Day. Subject to Section 4.5(c) of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall promptly deliver to the Agent, for the benefit of the applicable Holders, any such distributions received by the Collateral Agent. (b) Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Common Stock, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of Common Stock, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Separate COVERS a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to such Common Stock underlying their Separate COVERS; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. 31
Upon the written request of the Holders of Separate COVERS on such record date received by the Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of shares of Pledged Common Stock as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Separate COVERS, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Separate COVERS to timely instruct the Agent in order to enable the Agent to vote such Pledged Common Stock. Except as set forth in this Section 4.2, the Holders of Securities shall have no voting or other rights in respect of Common Stock. ARTICLE V THE CONTRACTS SECTION 5.1. PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. (a) Each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.9 or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.10, obligate the Holder of the related Security to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $200 (the "Purchase Price"), 5.0505 newly issued shares of Common Stock (the "Fixed-Share Settlement Rate") subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6 unless, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Security of which such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is a part. As provided in Section 5.12, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts. (b) Each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.9, or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with Section 5.10, obligate the Holder of the related Security to sell, and the Company to purchase, on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (as defined below) unless, on or prior to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Security of which such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is a part. The "Variable-Share Settlement Rate" is equal to (i) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $48.7080 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.9444 shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, (ii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $39.6000, the number of shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract equal to (x) $200 divided by $39.6000 minus (y) $200 divided by the Applicable Market Value, and 32
(iii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to $39.6000, zero shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6 (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). As provided in Section 5.12, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be sold upon settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts. (c) At any time prior to December 31, 2005, the Company may elect to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate in accordance with the formula (the "Fixing Formula") set forth on Exhibit F hereto (the new Settlement Rate referred to as the "Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate"). If the Company elects to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate, the Company must prepare and transmit to the Agent a Company Certificate setting forth its intention to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the expiration of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing the third Trading Day following the date of such Company Certificate, the Company will be required, in accordance with Section 5.7, to prepare and transmit to the Agent an additional Company Certificate setting forth its calculation of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate in accordance with the Fixing Formula and the effective date of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. In no event will the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate be greater than the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6. The Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate will become effective at the open of business two Business Days after the close of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period. (d) The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger contemplated by Section 5.10, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price per share (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business on such day. (e) Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Contract or Contracts on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such 33
Contract or Contracts, consents to the provisions hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Fixed-Share Right, or the Common Stock, as the case may be, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Security under the Contract or Contracts may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, (i) payment in respect of the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Common Stock under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments, (ii) upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to sell Common Stock under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract underlying a Separate COVERS, the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate Variable Share Repurchase Contract shall be delivered on the Settlement Date by the Collateral Agent to the Agent and, to the extent necessary, delivered by the Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Pledged Common Stock so delivered to the Company, and (iii) out of the Common Stock delivered upon settlement of such Holder's obligations under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract forming a part of the SPACES a number of Shares per related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) automatically shall be pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure such Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. (f) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Agent pursuant hereto) under the terms of this Agreement, the Contracts underlying such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Contracts underlying the Certificates so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. SECTION 5.2. CONTRACT PAYMENTS. (a) Subject to Section 5.3 herein, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered on the Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by a prior written notice by such Person. 34
(b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay Contract Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Payments), if any, shall cease. (c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Certificate (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the re-creation of a SPACES) shall carry the rights to Contract Payments, if any, accrued and unpaid, and to accrue Contract Payments, if any, which is carried by the Contracts underlying such other Certificates. (d) Subject to Sections 5.4, 5.9 and 5.10, in the case of any Security with respect to which Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of the underlying Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date or a Merger Early Settlement Date, respectively, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Payments on the Contract or Contracts underlying such Security otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, and such Contract Payments shall, subject to the receipt thereof by the Agent, be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Security (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) was registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any SPACES or Separate PACES with respect to which Early Settlement of the underlying Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is effected on an Early Settlement Date, Contract Payments, if any, that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement Date with respect to such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract shall not be payable. Holders of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts will continue to be entitled to receive Contract Payments (including any accrued Contract Payments or Deferred Contract Payments), if any, thereon after Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement thereof, in the same manner and at the same time as if such Contracts had not been settled. (e) Anything in this Agreement notwithstanding, the Company's obligations with respect to Contract Payments (including, for purposes of this Section 5.2(e), any accrued or Deferred Contract Payment) shall be subordinate and junior, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, to all Senior Indebtedness. If the Company shall default in the payment of any principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness when the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or at a date fixed for prepayment or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise, then, upon written notice of such default to the Company by the holders of Senior Indebtedness or any trustee therefor, unless and until such default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist, no Contract Payment shall be made or agreed to be made on account of the Securities. In the event of (a) any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition or other similar proceedings relating to the Company, its creditors or its property, (b) any proceeding for the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company, voluntary or involuntary, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, (c) any assignment by the Company for the benefit of creditors or (d) any other 35
marshalling of the assets of the Company (each such event, if any, herein sometimes referred to as a "Proceeding"), all Senior Indebtedness (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any such proceedings) shall first be paid in full before any Contract Payment shall be made to any Holder of any of the Securities on account thereof. Any Contract Payment which would otherwise (but for these subordination provisions) be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities shall be paid or delivered directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness in accordance with the priorities then existing among such holders until all Senior Indebtedness (including any interest thereon accruing after the commencement of any Proceeding) shall have been paid in full. SECTION 5.3. DEFERRAL OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS. (a) The Company shall have the right or, at the direction of the Federal Reserve Board, shall be obligated, at any time prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its intention to defer each such Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Securities, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Payments thereon at the rate of 6.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Payments"). Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3. No Contract Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, in the case of Contract Payments payable on the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, in the case of Contract Payments payable on the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Payments will terminate. (b) In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until a Payment Date prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, then all Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. (c) In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, 36
each Holder will receive on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Purchase Date, as applicable, an amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments, payable, at the Company's election, in shares of Common Stock or Notes. If the Company elects to pay the Deferred Contract Payments in shares of Common Stock, each Holder will receive a number of shares (in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, if applicable) equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments payable to such Holder divided by (B) the greater of (x) the Applicable Market Value on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, and (y) $13.20 (as adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 5.6). If the Company elects to issue Notes in payment of the Deferred Contract Payments, such Notes shall have a principal amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments. (d) No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued by the Company with respect to the payment of Deferred Contract Payments on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable with respect to such payment of Deferred Contract Payments, the Holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash as provided in Section 5.12. (e) In the event the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments, then until the Deferred Contract Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than: (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of the Company's Capital Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such Capital Stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the deferral of Contract Payments; (ii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for any Capital Stock of the Company's subsidiaries, or for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, or of any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other 37
rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock. SECTION 5.4. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; DELIVERY OF SHARES. (a) Upon the maturity of the Treasury Strips underlying the SPACES or Separate PACES, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to the SPACES or Separate PACES, as payment for the Common Stock issuable upon settlement thereof without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Securities, and the Collateral Agent shall deliver the Fixed-Share Rights Certificate to the Company for cancellation. (b) The obligations of each Holder of SPACES or Separate PACES to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent paid upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders under the related Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such proceeds and the Purchase Price. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Security unless the Company shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder by such Holder in the manner herein set forth and, in the case of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts that form a part of SPACES, the Company shall have received the related Fixed-Share Rights Certificate. (d) On the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, out of the Collateral securing Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of Separate COVERS, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate applicable to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts plus a cash payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, in satisfaction of the Holders' obligations to sell Common Stock pursuant to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Separate COVERS. Any shares of Common Stock held as Collateral that are in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy a Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts will be deposited by the Collateral Agent with the Agent, for the benefit of such Holder. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to dispose of any Collateral in order to make a cash payment to the Company in lieu of any a fraction of a share. (e) Subject to the obligations of a Holder in the event of a Collateral Insufficiency, as described in Section 4.5(c) of the Pledge Agreement, the obligations of each Holder of Separate COVERS to sell Common Stock pursuant to the underlying Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts are non-recourse obligations and shall be satisfied solely out of the Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such Collateral and the applicable Settlement Rate. SECTION 5.5. ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. (a) Unless a Termination Event shall have occurred on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or an 38
Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, and subject to Section 5.5(b), on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, upon the Company's receipt of payment in full of the Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holders pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article and subject to Section 5.6(b), the Company shall issue and deposit with the Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Securities (excluding Separate COVERS), one or more certificates representing the newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which both a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Contract Settlement Fund") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a SPACES Certificate or a Separate PACES Certificate to the Agent on or after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article V (after taking into account all Securities then held by such Holder) together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.12 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon surrender of a SPACES Certificate as described above or in connection with Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, the Holder of such Certificate shall also be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Separate COVERS Certificate representing a number of Separate COVERS equal to the number of Variable Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of the SPACES being settled and which Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts are not also being settled. Such shares and, if applicable, Separate COVERS Certificates shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or, if applicable, Separate COVERS Certificates issued in respect of a SPACES are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or, if applicable, SPACES is registered, no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of such Certificate or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. (b) Upon settlement of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract forming a part of a SPACES, whether such settlement is on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date as provided above or is an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement, without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, the Agent shall pledge to the Collateral Agent, as attorney-in-fact for such Holders, out of the shares of Common Stock deposited with the Agent for the benefit of such Holders, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) per Separate COVERS resulting from such settlement, as further provided in the Pledge Agreement. The Pledged Common Stock shall secure the Holders' obligations to sell Common Stock pursuant to the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of such Separate COVERS. 39
SECTION 5.6. ADJUSTMENT OF SETTLEMENT RATES. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (i) Stock Dividends. In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock in Common Stock, the Settlement Rates in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing the applicable Settlement Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (i), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (ii) Stock Purchase Rights. In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock (that are not available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Securities upon settlement of the Contracts underlying such Securities) entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment, share purchase or similar plan), the Settlement Rates in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be increased by dividing the applicable Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (ii), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (iii) Stock Splits; Reverse Splits. In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rates in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, 40
conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rates in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (iv) Debt or Asset Distributions. In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in paragraph (ii) of this Section, any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend, shares of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to a subsidiary or other business unit in the case of a Spin-Off referred to in the next paragraph, or dividend or other distribution referred to in paragraph (i) of this Section), the Settlement Rates shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by dividing the applicable Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (iv) is applicable, paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section shall not be applicable. (v) Spin-Off. In the case of a Spin-Off, the Settlement Rates in effect immediately before the close of business on the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive that distribution will be increased by multiplying the applicable Settlement Rate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus the Fair Market Value of the portion of those shares of Capital Stock or similar equity interests so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which is the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Any adjustment to the Settlement Rates under this paragraph (v) will occur on the date that is the earlier of (1) the tenth Trading Day following the effective date of the Spin-Off and (2) the date of the securities being offered in the Initial Public Offering of the Spin-Off, if that Initial Public Offering is effected simultaneously with the Spin-Off. (vi) Cash Distributions. In case the Company shall, (i) by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies or as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (iv) of this Section) in an aggregate amount that, when combined together with (ii) the aggregate amount of any other distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash (other than regular quarterly cash 41
dividends) within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (vi) or paragraph (vii) of this Section has been made and (iii) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value, as of the date of the expiration of the tender or exchange offer referred to below (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), of consideration payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd lot tender offer) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of the distribution described in clause (i) above and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (vi) or paragraph (vii) of this Section has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the fifth Trading Day following such date for determination, the Settlement Rates shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the applicable Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock plus an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the combined amount distributed or payable in the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date for determination and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock. Such increase in the Settlement Rates shall be given retroactive effect to the opening of business on the "ex date." (vii) Tender Offers. In case (i) a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) that when combined together with (ii) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd lot tender offer), of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this Section or this paragraph (vii) has been made and (iii) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all holders of the Company's Common Stock made exclusively in cash (other than regular quarterly cash dividends) within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this Section or this paragraph (vii) has been made, exceeds 15% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") 42
tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on the fifth Trading Day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Settlement Rates shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the applicable Settlement Rate immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be equal to (x) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (excluding any tendered shares) on the fifth Trading Day following the Expiration Time plus (y) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the transactions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above (assuming in the case of clause (i) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares), and (B) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (x) the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the fifth Trading Day following the date of the Expiration Time plus the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares"). (viii) Reclassification. The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.6(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (iv) of this Section), and (ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (iii) of this Section). (ix) Current Market Price. The "Current Market Price" per share of the Common Stock means (a) for purposes of paragraphs (ii) and (iv) of this Section 5.6(a), on any day the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days ending on the earlier of the day preceding the day in question and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such computation, (b) in the case of any Spin-Off that is effected simultaneously with an Initial Public Offering of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off, the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day on which the initial public offering price of the securities being distributed in the Spin-Off is determined, (c) in the case of any other Spin-Off, the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the first 10 Trading Days after the effective date of such Spin-Off, (d) for purposes of paragraph (vi) of this Section 5.6(a), the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days 43
commencing on the "ex date", and (e) for purposes of Paragraph (vii) of this Section 5.6(a), the average of the Closing Prices for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately following the date of the Expiration Time. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (x) Calculation of Adjustments. All adjustments to the Settlement Rates shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rates shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If an adjustment is made to the Settlement Rates pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii) or (xi) of this Section 5.6(a), an adjustment shall also be made to the Applicable Market Value solely to determine which of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Variable-Share Settlement Rate in Section 5.1(b) will apply on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date. Such adjustment shall be made by multiplying the Applicable Market Value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Variable-Share Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii) or (xi) of this Section 5.6(a) and the denominator of which shall be the Variable-Share Settlement Rate immediately before such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii) or (xi) of this Section 5.6(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate. (xi) Increase of Settlement Rates. The Company may make such increases in the Settlement Rates, in addition to those required by this Section, as it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reasons. (xii) The Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of June 18, 1998 (the "Rights Agreement") with Bank Boston N.A. pursuant to which share purchase rights (the "Rights") have been, and may in the future be, issued in respect of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon settlement of any Fixed-Share Purchase Contract pursuant to this Article V shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such settlement shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement as in effect at the time of such settlement. If after the date of this Agreement the rights separate from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Agreement so that a Holder would not be entitled to receive any Rights in respect of the 44
Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate will be adjusted as provided in paragraph (iv) of this Section 5.6(a) on the separation date, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the Rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon settlement Holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such settlement, the Rights that would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement. If the Company hereafter adopts any shareholder rights plan similar to the Rights Agreement, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of its Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement, the related rights for the Common Stock whether or not the rights under the future shareholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of settlement but otherwise subject to the generally applicable terms of such plan and no additional adjustment to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate shall be made for the future shareholder rights plan under this Section 5.6. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation is not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation), (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, (iii) any statutory exchange of securities of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition), or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any such event, a "Reorganization Event"), each share of Common Stock covered by each Contract immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, after such Reorganization Event, be converted for purposes of the Contract into the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event (without any interest thereon, and without any right to dividends or distributions thereon which have a record date that is prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable) per share of Common Stock by a holder of Common Stock that (i) is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "Constituent Person"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-Affiliates, and (ii) failed to exercise his 45
rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("Non-electing Share"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each Non-electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-electing Shares). On the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, the Settlement Rate then in effect will be applied to the value on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, of such securities, cash or other property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person that acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that the Holder of each Outstanding Security shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.6. Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments that, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section. The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. SECTION 5.7. NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER EVENTS. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rates are adjusted as herein provided, or the Variable-Share Settlement Rate is fixed pursuant to Section 5.1(c), the Company shall: (i) forthwith compute the Settlement Rates in accordance with Section 5.6 or, in the case of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate, in accordance with the Fixing Formula and prepare and transmit to the Agent and the Collateral Agent a Company Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rates or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based (which Company Certificate, in the case of the fixing of the Variable-Share Settlement Rate, shall be delivered by such time and date as specified in Section 5.1(c)); and (ii) as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an event that requires or permits an adjustment to the Settlement Rates pursuant to Section 5.6 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware) or following the fixing of the Variable-Share Settlement Rate, provide a written notice to the Holders of the Securities of the occurrence of such event and a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rates was determined or the Variable-Share Settlement Rate was fixed and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rates or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. 46
(b) Upon the occurrence of an event that requires or permits an adjustment to the Settlement Rates pursuant to Section 5.6, the Company, in consultation with the Collateral Agent, will determine whether, as a result of such adjustments, a Collateral Insufficiency exists. The Company shall specify in any Company Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(i) whether a Collateral Insufficiency exists. If the Company determines that a Collateral Insufficiency exists, the Company and the Collateral Agent will take such steps as provided for in Section 4.5(c) of the Pledge Agreement. (c) The Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rates, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Contract, and the Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. SECTION 5.8. TERMINATION EVENT; NOTICE. The Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive accumulated Contract Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Payments and obligations of the Holders to purchase or sell Common Stock, will immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, (i) the SPACES and Separate PACES shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such SPACES and Separate PACES and (ii) the Separate COVERS shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Pledged Common Stock forming a part of such Separate COVERS. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register. SECTION 5.9. EARLY SETTLEMENT. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.9, Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying SPACES or Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof and Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable. (b) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities shall deliver such Certificate to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of "Election to Settle Early" on the reverse 47
thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "Early Settlement Amount") equal to (A) the product of (i) the Stated Amount of such Securities multiplied by (ii) the number of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts during the period from close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Payments, if any, payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts; provided that no payment shall be required pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence if the Company shall have elected to defer the Contract Payments which would otherwise be payable on such Payment Date. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and subject to Section 5.2(d), no payment or adjustment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Fixed-Share Purchase Contract on any Contract Payments accrued on such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. (c) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing the related Security shall deliver such Certificate to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form "Election to Settle Early" on the reverse thereof duly completed and, in the case of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of SPACES, accompanied by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Variable-Share Early Settlement Rate (as defined below) together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12. Upon Early Settlement of any Variable-Share Repurchase Contract underlying a Separate COVERS, the obligation of the Holder of such Contract to deliver a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Variable-Share Early Settlement Rate shall be satisfied from the Pledged Common Stock delivered to the Agent by the Collateral Agent as provided below. Upon Early Settlement of any Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, the Holder thereof shall continue to be entitled to receive Contract Payments or Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments with respect to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract as if such Holder had not settled such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. (d) If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Contracts underlying any Security at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day, such day shall be the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Security and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "Early Settlement Date" with respect to such Security shall be the next succeeding Business Day. (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Fixed-Share Purchase Contract by the Holder of the related Securities, the Company shall issue (subject to Section 5.9(j)), and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate on account of such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract. Upon Early Settlement of any Variable-Share Repurchase Contract by the Holder of the related Securities, the Holder shall deliver, and the Company shall be entitled to receive, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate or, if the Variable-Share Settlement Rate has been fixed pursuant to Section 5.1(c) prior to such Early Settlement, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate (such number of shares 48
referred to as the "Variable-Share Early Settlement Rate," and together with the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate, the "Early Settlement Rate"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rates are adjusted under Section 5.6. Upon simultaneous Early Settlement of both Contracts underlying a SPACES, subject to Section 5.9(j), the Holder of such SPACES shall have no obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock with respect to its obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and instead the Company shall issue, and such Holder shall be entitled to receive, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the difference between the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate and the Variable-Share Early Settlement Rate (the "Net Early Settlement Rate"). (f) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause (i) subject to Section 5.9(j), the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, and (ii) the related Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips, in the case of SPACES or Separate PACES, or the related Pledged Common Stock, in the case of Separate COVERS, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or the Holder's designee as provided below. (g) Upon Early Settlement of any Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company (subject to Section 5.9(j)) and the Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips from the Collateral Agent, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities, (i) transfer to the Holder the Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips forming a part of such Securities, (ii) if the Holder elects to settle Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 1,000 related PACES, transfer to the Holder any remaining treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio, (iii) if the Holder elects to settle Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts in amounts other than integral multiples of 1,000 related PACES, transfer to the Holder any remaining treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio that are in integral multiples of $1,000 principal amount, but the Agent shall retain the remainder of the treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio and shall distribute the proceeds of such strips applicable to the Holder's Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio as such strips mature, (iv) subject to Section 5.5(b) and the Pledge Agreement, deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12, and (v) in the case of Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts forming a part of SPACES, deliver to the Holder a Separate COVERS Certificate representing a number of Separate COVERS equal to the number of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of the related SPACES and which Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts are not also being settled. (h) Upon Early Settlement of any Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of the Pledged Common Stock from the Collateral Agent in the case of Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts underlying Separate COVERS, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities, (i) transfer to the Holder any Pledged Common Stock that remains after satisfaction of the Holder's delivery obligations under the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, if 49
applicable, (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate evidencing the Holder's continued entitlement to receive Contract Payments or Deferred Contract Payments, substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto and (iii) in the case of Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of SPACES, deliver to the Holder a Separate PACES Certificate representing a number of Separate PACES equal to the number of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts forming a part of the related SPACES and which Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts are not also being settled. (i) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Contracts underlying less than all the Securities evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Agent shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Securities as to which Early Settlement was not effected. (j) The Company shall have the option, exercisable at any time or from time to time, to designate or change the designation, by delivering a Company Certificate to the Agent, a financial institution (an "Exchange Party") to which PACES related to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts surrendered by a Holder for Early Settlement initially will be offered by the Agent on behalf of a Holder for exchange in lieu of Early Settlement. The Exchange Party initially shall be Goldman, Sachs & Co. The Exchange Party may, at its option, submit to the Agent a non-binding offer to accept PACES surrendered for Early Settlement; provided that the Exchange Party may accept for exchange only PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Subject to the foregoing, the Exchange Party may accept for exchange all or any of such PACES offered to it from time to time if it agrees, no later than the time specified in Section 5.9(f) with respect to the Company's delivery obligations in connection with an Early Settlement, to deliver in exchange therefor and the Early Settlement Amount, (i) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, and (ii) Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and any remaining treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio, in each case, that would be issued and/or delivered upon Early Settlement of the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts related to such PACES in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided that, if a Holder has surrendered Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts for Early Settlement in other than integral multiples of 1,000 related PACES and, upon Early Settlement, the Agent would otherwise be required to retain all or a portion of the remaining treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio for the Holder's benefit until such treasury strips mature, then the Exchange Party shall agree to deliver to the Holder, in respect of such treasury strips that would have otherwise been retained by the Agent, cash in an amount equal to the Treasury Fair Market Value (the amounts and securities described in (i) and (ii) above, including any cash in respect of treasury strips, the "Exchange Consideration"). Settlement for any such exchange shall take place no later than the third Business Day following such acceptance by the delivery of the Exchange Consideration by the Exchange Party to the Agent and the subsequent delivery of the Exchange Consideration by the Agent to the surrendering Holder. In the event that the Exchange Party fails to deliver the Exchange Consideration by such third Business Day, the Exchange Party shall be in default of its obligations and, instead of being exchanged, the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts related to such PACES will be subject to Early Settlement in accordance with the terms hereof. Any PACES that have been exchanged shall remain outstanding as Separate PACES and the Agent shall deliver to the Exchange Party a Separate PACES Certificate evidencing the number of Separate PACES actually exchanged by the Exchange Party. Except as set forth in this Section 5.9(j), all 50
other procedures set forth in this Section 5.9 and applicable to Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts shall also be applicable to the exchange of PACES pursuant to this Section 5.9(j). SECTION 5.10. EARLY SETTLEMENT UPON CASH MERGER. (a) In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company of the type described in clause (1) of Section 5.6(b) in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation is exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event a "Cash Merger"), then the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall be required to offer the Holder of each Security the right to settle the Contract or Contracts underlying such Security prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable ("Merger Early Settlement"), as provided herein. Holders exercising their right of Merger Early Settlement with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts may exercise such right only with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying SPACES or Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each such notice shall contain: (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"); (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised; (iii) the Settlement Rates in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable or deliverable by the Holder upon settlement of each Contract pursuant to Section 5.6(b); (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the Purchase Price payable by the Holder to settle the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract will be offset against the amount of cash so receivable upon exercise of Merger Early Settlement, as applicable; (v) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property deliverable by the Holder to settle the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract forming a part of a Separate COVERS will be offset against the Collateral held by the Collateral Agent to secure such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, as applicable; (vi) a statement to the effect that, upon simultaneous Merger Early Settlement of both Contracts underlying a SPACES, the Holder of such SPACES shall have no obligation to deliver any cash, securities and other property with respect to its 51
obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and instead the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered, and such Holder shall be entitled to receive for each SPACES, the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property equal to the difference between the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate and the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate if then in effect), in each case as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6; and (vii) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. (b) To exercise a Merger Early Settlement right, a Holder shall deliver to the Agent at the Corporate Trust Office at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the date specified in the notice, the Certificate(s) evidencing the Securities with respect to which the Merger Early Settlement right is being exercised duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of "Election to Settle Early" on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by (i) with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, payment payable to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount (the "Merger Early Settlement Amount") equal to the Early Settlement Amount less the amount of cash that otherwise would be deliverable by the Company or its successor upon settlement of the Fixed-share Purchase Contract in lieu of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5.6(b) and as described in the notice to Holders and (ii) with respect to Variable-share Repurchase Contracts, subject to Section 5.10(a)(v) and (vi), the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property equal to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate if then in effect) as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6. (c) On the Merger Early Settlement Date, the Company shall (i) with respect to SPACES or Separate PACES, (A) subject to Section 5.10(a)(vi), deliver or cause to be delivered the net cash, securities and other property to be received by such exercising Holder, equal to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6, in respect of the number of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts for which such Merger Early Settlement right was exercised, and (B) cause the related Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and (ii) with respect to Separate COVERS, subject to Section 5.10(a)(v) and (vi), cause the Collateral securing the underlying Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent, and transferred, in each case, to the Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. In the event a Merger Early Settlement right shall be exercised by a Holder in accordance with the terms hereof, all references herein to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, shall be deemed to refer to such Merger Early Settlement Date. (d) Upon Merger Early Settlement of any Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of such net cash, securities or other property from the Company and the Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips from the Collateral Agent, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities, (i) transfer to the Holder the Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips forming a part of such Securities, (ii) if the Holder elects to settle Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts in integral multiples of 1,000 related PACES, transfer to the Holder any remaining treasury strips in the 52
Treasury Portfolio, (iii) if the Holder elects to settle Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts in amounts other than integral multiples of 1,000 related PACES, transfer to the Holder any remaining treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio that are in integral multiples of $1,000 face amount, but the Agent shall retain the remainder of the treasury strips in the Treasury Portfolio and shall distribute the proceeds of such strips applicable to the Holder's Ownership interest in the Treasury Portfolio as such strips mature, (iv) subject to Section 5.5(b) and the Pledge Agreement, deliver to the Holder such net cash, securities or other property issuable upon such Merger Early Settlement together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.12, (v) in the case of Merger Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts forming a part of SPACES, deliver to the Holder a Separate COVERS Certificate representing a number of Separate COVERS equal to the number of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of the related SPACES and which Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts are not also being settled and (vi) deliver to the Holder a certificate evidencing the Holder's continued entitlement to receive Contract Payments or Deferred Contract Payments substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto. (e) Upon Merger Early Settlement of any Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, and subject to receipt from the Collateral Agent, in the case of Merger Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts underlying Separate COVERS, of the Collateral securing such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, the Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Securities, (i) subject to Section 5.10(a)(v) and (vi), transfer to the Holder such Collateral, if applicable, (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate evidencing the Holder's continued entitlement to receive Contract Payments or Deferred Contract Payments, substantially in the form of Exhibit H hereto and (iii) in the case of Merger Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of SPACES, deliver to the Holder a Separate PACES Certificate representing a number of Separate PACES equal to the number of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts forming a part of the related SPACES and which Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts are not also being settled. (f) In the event that Merger Early Settlement is effected with respect to Contracts underlying less than all the Securities evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Merger Early Settlement the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall execute and the Agent shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Securities as to which Merger Early Settlement was not effected. SECTION 5.11. CHARGES AND TAXES. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts and in payment of any Deferred Contract Payments; provided, that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Security or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Securities evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless and until the Person or 53
Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 5.12. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of any Contracts. The number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Contracts on the applicable Settlement Date or upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, the Company or the Holder, as applicable, through the Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional shares in an amount equal to the value of such fractional shares times the Applicable Market Value. The Company shall provide the Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.12 in a timely manner. ARTICLE VI REMEDIES SECTION 6.1. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE CONTRACT PAYMENTS AND PURCHASE COMMON STOCK. The Holder of any SPACES, Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, as the case may be, shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, (a) subject to the deferral provisions set forth in Section 5.3, and to the forfeiture of any Deferred Contract Payments with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts upon Early Settlement thereof pursuant to Section 5.9 or with respect to all Contracts upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, to receive payment of each installment of the Contract Payments, if any, with respect to the Contract constituting a part of such Security on the respective Payment Date for such Security and to institute suit for the enforcement of such right to receive Contract Payments, and (b) to purchase Common Stock pursuant to the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract constituting a part of such SPACES or Separate PACES and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such right to purchase Common Stock, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.2. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. 54
SECTION 6.3. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates in Section 3.10(f), no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 6.4. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy upon a Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Holders. SECTION 6.5. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. All parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance of such Security shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit against the Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Agent, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Agent, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Securities, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of distributions on any Contract on or after the Payment Date therefor in respect of any Security held by such Holder, or for enforcement of the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract constituting part of any Security held by such Holder. SECTION 6.6. WAIVER OF STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Agreement; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

(c) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Agent shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. SECTION 7.9. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No resignation or removal of the Agent and no appointment of a successor 59
Agent pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Agent in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 7.10.

If the Company elects to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate, the Company must prepare and transmit to the Agent a Company Certificate setting forth its intention to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the expiration of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing the third Trading Day following the date of such Company Certificate, the Company will be required, in accordance with Section 5.7 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, to prepare and transmit to the Agent an additional Company Certificate setting forth its calculation of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate in accordance with the Fixing Formula and the effective date of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. In no event will the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate be greater than the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate will become effective at the open of business two Business Days after the close of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger contemplated by Section 5.10 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price per share (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business on such day. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying SPACES or Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof and Variable- A-7
Share Repurchase Contracts, may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable. Upon Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, in exchange for the Purchase Price, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a number of shares equal to the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate. Upon Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, the Holder thereof shall be required to deliver a number of shares equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Variable-Share Settlement Rate prior to such Early Settlement, a number of shares equal to the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company of the type described in clause (1) of Section 5.6(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation is exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event a "Cash Merger"), then the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall be required to offer the Holder of each Security the right to settle the Contract or Contracts underlying such Security prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable ("Merger Early Settlement"), as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Holders exercising their right of Merger Early Settlement with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts may exercise such right only with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying SPACES or Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each notice shall contain, (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"), (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised, (iii) the Settlement Rates in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable or deliverable by the Holder upon settlement of each Contract pursuant to Section 5.6(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the Purchase Price payable by the Holder to settle the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract will be offset against the amount of cash so receivable upon exercise of Merger Early Settlement, as applicable, (v) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property deliverable by the Holder to settle the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract forming a part of a Separate COVERS will be offset against the Collateral held by the Collateral Agent to secure such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, as applicable, (vi) a statement to the effect that, upon simultaneous Merger Early Settlement of both Contracts underlying a SPACES, the Holder of such SPACES shall have no obligation to deliver any cash, securities and other property with respect to its obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and instead the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered, and such Holder shall be entitled to receive for each SPACES, the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property equal to the difference between the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate and the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate if then in effect), in each case as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Purchase A-8
Contract Agreement and (vii) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. Upon the maturity of the Treasury Strips underlying the SPACES or Separate PACES, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to the SPACES or Separate PACES, as payment for the Common Stock issuable upon settlement thereof without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Securities. The obligations of each Holder of SPACES or Separate PACES to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent paid upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders under the related Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such proceeds and the Purchase Price. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Security unless the Company shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth, and in the case of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts that form a part of SPACES and are settled on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, the Company shall have received the related Fixed-Share Rights Certificate for cancellation. On the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, out of the Collateral securing Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of Separate COVERS, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate applicable to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts plus a cash payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, in satisfaction of the Holders' obligations to sell Common Stock pursuant to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Separate COVERS. Any shares of Common Stock held as Collateral that are in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy a Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts will be deposited by the Collateral Agent with the Agent, for the benefit of such Holder. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to dispose of any Collateral in order to make a cash payment to the Company in lieu of any fraction of a share. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Common Stock, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of Common Stock, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Separate COVERS a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to such Common Stock underlying their Separate COVERS; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Separate COVERS on such record date received by the Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Agent shall A-9
endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of shares of Pledged Common Stock as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Separate COVERS, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Separate COVERS to timely instruct the Agent in order to enable the Agent to vote such Pledged Common Stock. The SPACES Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single SPACES and any integral multiple thereof. Each SPACES Certificate shall evidence the number of SPACES specified therein, with each such SPACES representing the ownership by the Holder thereof of (i) one PACES and (ii) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. One PACES shall represent the ownership by the Holder thereof of (x) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, subject to the Pledge thereof, (y) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and (z) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, subject to the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Right, which Fixed-Share Right shall be evidenced by the Fixed-Share Rights Certificate substantially in the form attached to this SPACES Certificate. The Agent, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each SPACES shall pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip and the Fixed-Share Right forming a part of such SPACES to the Collateral Agent and grant to the Collateral Agent a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip and the Fixed-Share Right, for the benefit of the Company, to secure, in the case of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the obligation of the Holder under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract to purchase the Common Stock of the Company and, in the case of the Fixed-Share Right, the obligation of the Holder under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to sell the Common Stock of the Company. Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, such Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of SPACES Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company. The transfer of any SPACES Certificate will be registered and SPACES Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The SPACES Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a SPACES Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. A Holder may separate the PACES from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract in respect of the SPACES held by such Holder by substituting for the Pledged Fixed-Share Right securing such Holder's obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract a number of shares of Common Stock in an amount equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract (a "Collateral A-10
Substitution"). A Holder may effectuate a Collateral Substitution, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) and (ii) transferring the related SPACES to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Common Stock to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Fixed-Share Right underlying such SPACES, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Common Stock described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release such Pledged Fixed-Share Right from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon notification of such release the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related SPACES and (ii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Separate PACES Certificate and a Separate COVERS Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of PACES and Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled SPACES. Holders who elect to separate the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts and to substitute Common Stock for such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. Except as described in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying a SPACES remains in effect, such SPACES shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such SPACES in respect of such constituent parts may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a SPACES, subject to the pledge of the Fixed-Share Right pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. A Holder of Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may re-create SPACES, at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) pledging to the Collateral Agent the Fixed-Share Rights relating to such number of Separate PACES as is equal to such Separate COVERS and (ii) transferring such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has pledged the relevant amount of Fixed-Share Rights to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Rights described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Common Stock, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (a) cancel the related A-11
Separate PACES and Separate COVERS; (b) transfer the Pledged Common Stock to the Holder; and (c) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a SPACES Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled Separate PACES and Separate Covers. Except as provided in Section 3.14 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Separate PACES and Separate COVERS shall not be available for re-creating SPACES, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, including the Collateral related thereto. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered on the Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by a prior written notice by such Person. A Holder shall be entitled to continue receiving Contract Payments after Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of a Contract, except in the case of Early Settlement of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract. The Company shall have the right or, at the direction of the Federal Reserve Board, shall be obligated, at any time prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its intention to defer each such Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Securities, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Payments thereon at the rate of 6.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Payments"). Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, in the case of Contract Payments payable on the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, in the case of Contract Payments payable on the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination A-12
Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Payments will terminate. In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until a Payment Date prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, then all Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Payments) shall be subordinate and junior in right, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, to all Senior Indebtedness. In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, each Holder will receive on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Purchase Date, as applicable, an amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments, payable, at the Company's election, in (i) shares of Common Stock or (ii) Notes. If the Company elects to pay the Deferred Contract Payments in shares of Common Stock, each Holder will receive a number of shares (in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, if applicable) equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments payable to such Holder divided by (B) the greater of (x) the Applicable Market Value on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, and (y) $13.20 (as adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement). If the Company elects to issue Notes in payment of the Deferred Contract Payments, such Notes shall have a principal amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments. In the event the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments, then until the Deferred Contract Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than: (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of the Company's Capital Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such Capital Stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the deferral of Contract Payments; (ii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for any Capital Stock of the Company's subsidiaries, or for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, or of any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the A-13
same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock. The Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive accumulated Contract Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Payments and obligations of the Holders to purchase or sell Common Stock, will immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, (i) the SPACES and Separate PACES shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such SPACES and Separate PACES and (ii) the Separate COVERS shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Pledged Common Stock forming a part of such Separate COVERS. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register. Upon registration of transfer of this SPACES Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Contracts evidenced by this SPACES Certificate and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Contract or Contracts on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Contract or Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, irrevocably authorizes the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Fixed-Share Right, or the Common Stock, as the case may be, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Security under the Contract or Contracts may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance hereof, further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, (i) payment in respect of the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Common Stock under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments, (ii) upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to sell Common Stock under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract underlying a Separate COVERS, the Pledged Common Stock underlying A-14
such Separate COVERS shall be delivered on the Settlement Date by the Collateral Agent to the Agent and, to the extent necessary, delivered by the Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Pledged Common Stock so delivered to the Company, and (iii) out of the Common Stock delivered upon settlement of such Holder's obligations under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract forming a part of the SPACES, a number of shares per related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) automatically shall be pledged to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, to secure such Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance hereof, will be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the applicable Contracts by the Company, its trustee in bankruptcy, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. The Company and each Holder covenant and agree, for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to (i) treat a Holder's acquisition and ownership of SPACES as the acquisition and ownership of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and the Contracts underlying the SPACES, (ii) treat a Holder's acquisition and ownership of Separate PACES as the acquisition and ownership of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying the Separate PACES and (iii) treat a Holder's acquisition and ownership of Separate COVERS as the acquisition and ownership of the underlying Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and of the Pledged Common Stock constituting the Collateral securing such Holder's obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Contracts. The Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by and deemed to be a contract under, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof. The Company, the Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Agent, may treat the Person in whose name this SPACES Certificate is registered on the SPACES Register as the owner of the SPACES evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving quarterly payments on the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, receiving payments of Contract Payments, if any, and any Deferred Contract Payments, performance of the Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Agent, such Affiliates nor any agent of the Company, the Agent or such Affiliates shall be affected by notice to the contrary. A-15
Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, such Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts shall not entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock. A copy of the Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Agent. A-16
FORM OF FIXED-SHARE RIGHTS CERTIFICATE STATE STREET CORPORATION [THIS CERTIFICATE REPRESENTS FIXED-SHARE RIGHTS THAT FORM A PART OF SPACES ISSUED BY STATE STREET CORPORATION. THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE UNDERLYING FIXED-SHARE RIGHTS MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED SEPARATELY FROM THE SPACES CERTIFICATE OR THE SPACES EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLEDGE TO OR RELEASE BY THE COLLATERAL AGENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) OF THE FIXED-SHARE RIGHTS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND THE PLEDGE AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).] constituting a part of 6.75% SPACES ($200 Stated Amount) No. ___ This Fixed-Share Rights Certificate certifies that ____________ is the registered Holder of a number of Fixed-Share Rights corresponding with the number of SPACES outstanding from time to time. Each Fixed-Share Right represents a Holder's right to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying a SPACES equal to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between State Street Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"). Each Fixed-Share Right forms a part of the related SPACES and may not be transferred except in connection with the pledge thereof pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. The Fixed-Share Right evidenced hereby is governed by the Purchase Contract Agreement, to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Fixed-Share Rights Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Fixed-Share Right, forming a part of the related SPACES, has been pledged to the Collateral Agent and a security interest has been granted to the Collateral Agent in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Fixed-Share Right, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligation of the Holder under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to sell the Common Stock to the Company. A Holder may separate the PACES from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract in respect of the SPACES held by such Holder by substituting for the Pledged Fixed-Share Right A-17
securing such Holder's obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract (a "Collateral Substitution"). A Holder may effectuate a Collateral Substitution, at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) depositing with the Collateral Agent a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share) and (ii) transferring the related SPACES to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Common Stock to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Fixed-Share Right underlying such SPACES, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Common Stock described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release such Pledged Fixed-Share Right from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon notification of such release the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related SPACES; and (ii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a Separate PACES Certificate and a Separate COVERS Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of PACES and Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled SPACES. Holders who elect to separate the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights from the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts and to substitute Common Stock for such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent in respect of the substitution, and the Company shall not be responsible for any such fees or expenses. In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to Section 3.13 of the Purchase Contract Agreement fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the SPACES or fails to deliver a SPACES Certificate to the Agent after depositing Common Stock with the Collateral Agent, the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights constituting a part of such SPACES, and any distributions on such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights shall be held by the Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such SPACES are so transferred or the SPACES Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, with respect to a SPACES Certificate, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Agent that such SPACES Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Agent and the Company. Except as described in Section 3.13 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying a SPACES remains in effect, such SPACES shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such A-18
SPACES in respect of such constituent parts may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a SPACES, subject to the pledge of the Fixed-Share Right pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. A Holder of Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may re-create SPACES, at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) pledging to the Collateral Agent the Fixed-Share Rights relating to such number of Separate PACES as is equal to such Separate COVERS and (ii) transferring such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has pledged the relevant amount of Fixed-Share Rights to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Rights described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Common Stock, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Separate PACES and Separate COVERS; (ii) transfer the Pledged Common Stock to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a SPACES Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled Separate PACES and Separate COVERS. Except as provided in Section 3.14 to the Purchase Contract Agreement, Separate PACES and Separate COVERS shall not be available for re-creating SPACES, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, including the Collateral related thereto.

Each Separate PACES represents the ownership by the Holder thereof of (i) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, subject to the Pledge thereof, (ii) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and (iii) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and State Street Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), under one Fixed-Share Purchase Contract. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip forming a part of such Separate PACES has been pledged to the Collateral Agent and a security interest has been granted to the Collateral Agent in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligation of the Holder under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract to purchase the Common Stock of the Company.

Each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred or Merger Early Settlement has occurred in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement, obligate the Holder of the Separate PACES to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $200 (the "Purchase Price"), 5.0505 newly issued shares of Common Stock (the "Fixed-Share Settlement Rate"), subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, unless, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Separate PACES of which such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is a part. As provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay in arrears on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2003 (a "Payment Date") in respect of each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract forming part of a Separate PACES evidenced hereby an amount equal to 0.75% per year of the Stated Amount, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (provided that if any date on which Contract Payments are to be made on the Contracts is not a Business Day, then payment of such Contract Payments payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and no interest or payment will be paid in respect of such delay, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day).

AGENT'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Separate PACES Certificates referred to in the within-mentioned Purchase Contract Agreement. Dated: BANK ONE TRUST COMPANY, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent By ------------------------------------------------ Authorized Signatory B-5
(FORM OF REVERSE OF SEPARATE PACES CERTIFICATE) Each Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company, and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Separate PACES Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred, or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred obligate the Holder of the related Separate PACES to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date at a price equal to $200 (the "Purchase Price"), 5.0505 newly issued shares of Common Stock (the "Fixed-Share Settlement Rate"), subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, unless, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Separate PACES of which such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract is a part and no fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, all as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date. Upon Early Settlement of Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, in exchange for the Purchase Price, the Holder thereof shall be entitled to receive a number of shares equal to the Fixed-Share Early Settlement Rate. In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company of the type described in the Purchase Contract Agreement in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation is exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event a "Cash Merger"), then the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall be required to offer the Holder of each Security the right to settle the Contract or Contracts underlying such Security prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable ("Merger Early Settlement"), as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Holders exercising their right of Merger Early Settlement with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts may exercise such right only with respect to Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying Separate PACES having an aggregate Stated Amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each notice shall contain, (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"), (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by B-6
which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised, (iii) the Settlement Rates in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable or deliverable by the Holder upon settlement of each Contract pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement, (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the Purchase Price payable by the Holder to settle the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract will be offset against the amount of cash so receivable upon exercise of Merger Early Settlement, as applicable and (v) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. Upon the maturity of the Treasury Strips underlying Separate PACES, on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Purchase Price applicable to such Separate PACES, as payment for the Common Stock issuable upon settlement thereof without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Separate PACES. The obligations of each Holder of Separate PACES to pay the Purchase Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent paid upon Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders under the related Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between such proceeds and the Purchase Price. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder of the related Separate PACES unless the Company shall have received payment in full of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. The Separate PACES Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Separate PACES and any integral multiple thereof. Each Separate PACES Certificate shall evidence the number of Separate PACES specified therein, with each such Separate PACES representing the ownership by the Holder thereof of (i) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, subject to the Pledge thereof, (ii) the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and (iii) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Fixed-Share Purchase Contract. The Agent, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of the Holder of each Separate PACES shall Pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip forming a part of such Separate PACES to the Collateral Agent and grant to the Collateral Agent a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligation of the Holder under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract to purchase the Common Stock of the Company. Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, such Contracts shall not entitle the Holders of Separate PACES Certificates to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company. The transfer of any Separate PACES Certificate will be registered and Separate PACES Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Separate PACES Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate B-7
endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Separate PACES Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. A Holder of Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may re-create SPACES, at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) pledging to the Collateral Agent the Fixed-Share Rights relating to such number of Separate PACES as is equal to such Separate COVERS and (ii) transferring such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has pledged the relevant amount of Fixed-Share Right to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Rights described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Common Stock, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (a) cancel the related Separate PACES and Separate COVERS; (b) transfer the Pledged Common Stock to the Holder; and (c) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a SPACES Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled Separate PACES and Separate COVERS. Except as provided in Section 3.14 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Separate PACES and Separate COVERS shall not be available for re-creating SPACES, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, including the Collateral related thereto. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Fixed-Share Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered on the Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by a prior written notice by such Person. A Holder shall be entitled to continue receiving Contract Payments after Merger Early Settlement of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract. The Company shall have the right or, at the direction of the Federal Reserve Board, shall be obligated, at any time prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share B-8
Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its intention to defer each such Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Securities, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Payments thereon at the rate of 6.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Payments"). Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to Section 5.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, in the case of Contract Payments payable on the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Payments will terminate. In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until a Payment Date prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, then all Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Payments) shall be subordinate and junior in right, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, to all Senior Indebtedness. In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, each Holder will receive on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, an amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments, payable, at the Company's election, in (i) shares of Common Stock or (ii) Notes. If the Company elects to pay the Deferred Contract Payments in shares of Common Stock, each Holder will receive a number of shares (in addition to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, if applicable) equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments payable to such Holder divided by (B) the greater of (x) the Applicable Market Value on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date and (y) $13.20 (as adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement). If the Company elected to issue Notes in payment of the Deferred Contract Payments, such Notes shall have a principal amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments. B-9
In the event the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments, then until the Deferred Contract Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than: (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of the Company's Capital Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such Capital Stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the deferral of Contract Payments; (ii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for any Capital Stock of the Company's subsidiaries, or for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, or of any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock. The Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive accumulated Contract Payments, if any, or any Deferred Contract Payments and obligations of the Holders to purchase or sell Common Stock, will immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Separate PACES shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips and the Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio forming a part of such Separate PACES. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register. Upon registration of transfer of this Separate PACES Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Contracts evidenced hereby and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Contracts evidenced by this Separate PACES Certificate and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance hereof, irrevocably authorizes the Agent to enter into and perform the related Contract or Contracts on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder), agrees to be bound by the B-10
terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Contract or Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, irrevocably authorizes the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to enter into and perform the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to and agrees to be bound by the Pledge of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip or Fixed-Share Right, as the case may be, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Security under the Contract or Contracts may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. Each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance hereof, further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.4 of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payment in respect of the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip to be paid upon settlement of such Holder's obligations to purchase Common Stock under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, shall be paid on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance hereof, will be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the applicable Contracts by the Company, its trustee in bankruptcy, any receiver, liquidator or person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. The Company and each Holder covenant and agree, for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes to treat a Holder's acquisition and ownership of Separate PACES as the acquisition and ownership of the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio and the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract underlying the Separate PACES.

Each Separate COVERS represents the ownership by the Holder thereof of the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and State Street Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company") under one Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and the pledge of Common Stock by the Holder to secure such Holder's obligation under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, as further described below. Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share), subject to adjustment in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rates under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract has been pledged to the Collateral Agent and a security interest has been granted to the Collateral Agent in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Common Stock, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligation of such Holder under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to sell the Common Stock to the Company. Subject to Section 4.2 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of each Separate COVERS shall be entitled, with respect to the Pledged Common Stock, to all of the C-1
rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock. All capitalized terms used herein which are defined in the Purchase Contract Agreement have the meaning set forth therein. Each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred, obligate the Holder of the related Security to sell, and the Company to purchase, on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (as defined below) (the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, the Variable-Share Settlement Rate or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate (as defined below) referred to as the "Settlement Rate") unless, on or prior to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Security of which such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is a part. The "Variable-Share Settlement Rate" is equal to: (i) if the Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is equal to or greater than $48.7080 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.9444 shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, (ii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $39.6000, the number of shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract equal to (x) $200 divided by $39.6000 minus (y) $200 divided by the Applicable Market Value, and (iii)if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to $39.6000, zero shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). As provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, no fractional shares of Common Stock will be sold upon settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts. The Company shall pay in arrears on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May 15, 2003 (a "Payment Date") in respect of each Separate COVERS evidenced hereby an amount equal to 4.00% per year of the Stated Amount of SPACES, computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, subject to deferral at the option of the Company as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and more fully described on the reverse hereof (provided that if any date on which Contract Payments are to be made on the Contracts is not a Business Day, then payment of such Contract Payments payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and no interest or payment will be paid in respect of such delay, except that if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day). Such Contract Payments shall be payable to the Person in whose name this Separate COVERS Certificate (or a Predecessor Separate COVERS Certificate) is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Payments will be payable at the office of the Agent in The City of New York, New York or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person C-2

AGENT'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Separate COVERS Certificates referred to in the within-mentioned Purchase Contract Agreement. Dated: BANK ONE TRUST COMPANY, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent By:________________________________ Authorized Signatory C-5
(FORM OF REVERSE OF SEPARATE COVERS CERTIFICATE) Each Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of January 21, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "Agent"), to which Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Separate COVERS Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract shall, unless an Early Settlement has occurred or a Merger Early Settlement has occurred, obligate the Holder of the related Security to sell, and the Company to purchase, on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate (the Fixed-Share Settlement Rate, the Variable-Share Settlement Rate or the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate referred to as the "Settlement Rate") unless, on or prior to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, there shall have occurred a Termination Event with respect to the Security of which such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is a part. The "Variable-Share Settlement Rate" is equal to (i) if the Applicable Market Value is equal to or greater than $48.7080 (the "Threshold Appreciation Price"), 0.9444 shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, (ii) if the Applicable Market Value is less than the Threshold Appreciation Price, but is greater than $39.6000, the number of shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract equal to (x) $200 divided by $39.6000 minus (y) $200 divided by the Applicable Market Value, and (iii)if the Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to $39.6000, zero shares of Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Purchase Contract, in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be sold upon settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts. At any time prior to December 31, 2005, the Company may elect to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate in accordance with the formula (the "Fixing Formula") set forth on Exhibit F attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement (the new Settlement Rate referred to as the "Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate"). If the Company elects to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate, the Company must prepare and transmit to the Agent a Company Certificate setting forth its intention to fix the Variable-Share Settlement Rate. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the expiration of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period commencing the third Trading Day following the date of such Company Certificate, the Company will be required, in accordance with Section 5.7 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, C-6
to prepare and transmit to the Agent an additional Company Certificate setting forth its calculation of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate in accordance with the Fixing Formula and the effective date of the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. In no event will the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate be greater than the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.6. The Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate will become effective at the open of business two Business Days after the close of the 20 consecutive Trading Day period. The "Applicable Market Value" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date or, in the event of a Cash Merger contemplated by Section 5.10 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Cash Merger Date. The "Closing Price" of the Common Stock on any date of determination means the closing sale price per share (or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price) of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on such date or, if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed, or if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States securities exchange, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, or if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization, or if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose. A "Trading Day" means a day on which the Common Stock (A) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (B) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock at the close of business on such day. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of Section 5.9 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, may, at the option of the Holder thereof, be settled early ("Early Settlement") on or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date. Upon Early Settlement of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, the Holder thereof shall be required to deliver a number of shares equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate or, if the Company has fixed the Variable-Share Settlement Rate prior to such Early Settlement, a number of shares equal to the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate. In the event of a merger or consolidation of the Company of the type described in clause (1) of Section 5.6(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement in which the Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation is exchanged for consideration consisting of at least 30% cash or cash equivalents (any such event a "Cash Merger"), then the Company (or the successor to the Company hereunder) shall be required to offer the Holder of each Separate COVERS the right to settle the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract underlying such Separate COVERS prior to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, ("Merger Early Settlement"), as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. On or before the fifth Business Day after the consummation of a Cash Merger, the Company or, at the request and expense of the Company, the Agent, shall give all Holders notice of the occurrence of the Cash Merger and of the right of Merger Early Settlement arising as a result thereof. The Company shall also C-7
deliver a copy of such notice to the Agent and the Collateral Agent. Each notice shall contain, (i) the date, which shall be not less than 20 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of such notice, on which the Merger Early Settlement will be effected (the "Merger Early Settlement Date"), (ii) the date, which shall be on or one Business Day prior to the Merger Early Settlement Date, by which the Merger Early Settlement right must be exercised, (iii) the Settlement Rates in effect as a result of such Cash Merger and the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property receivable or deliverable by the Holder upon settlement of each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract pursuant to Section 5.6(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, (iv) a statement to the effect that all or a portion of the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property deliverable by the Holder to settle the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract forming a part of a Separate COVERS will be offset against the Collateral held by the Collateral Agent to secure such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, as applicable, and (v) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise the Merger Early Settlement right. On the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, out of the Collateral securing Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of Separate COVERS, the Collateral Agent shall remit to the Company an amount of shares of Common Stock equal to the Settlement Rate applicable to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts plus a cash payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, in satisfaction of the Holders' obligations to sell Common Stock pursuant to such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, without receiving any instructions from the Holders of such Separate COVERS. Any shares of Common Stock held as Collateral that are in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy a Holder's obligations under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts will be deposited by the Collateral Agent with the Agent, for the benefit of such Holder. The Collateral Agent shall be entitled to dispose of any Collateral in order to make a payment to the Company in lieu of any a fraction of a share. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Common Stock, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of Common Stock, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Separate COVERS a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to such Common Stock underlying their Separate COVERS; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Separate COVERS on such record date received by the Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of shares of Pledged Common Stock as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Separate COVERS, the Agent shall abstain from voting the Pledged Common Stock C-8
underlying such Separate COVERS. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Separate COVERS to timely instruct the Agent in order to enable the Agent to vote such Pledged Common Stock. The Separate COVERS Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Separate COVERS and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Separate COVERS Certificate will be registered and Separate COVERS Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Separate COVERS Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange of a Separate COVERS Certificate, but the Company and the Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges not involving any transfer as provided for in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Separate COVERS Certificate shall evidence the number of Separate COVERS specified therein, with each such Separate COVERS representing the ownership by the Holder thereof of the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Variable-Share Repurchase Contract and the pledge of Common Stock by the Holder to secure such Holder's obligation under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. The Agent, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Separate COVERS shall pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (rounded up to the nearest whole share), subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to the Collateral Agent and grant to the Collateral Agent a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Common Stock, for the benefit of the Company, to secure the obligation of such Holder under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to sell the Common Stock to the Company. Subject to Section 4.2 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of each Separate COVERS shall be entitled, with respect to the Pledged Common Stock, to all of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock. A Holder of Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may re-create SPACES, at any time from and after the date of the Purchase Contract Agreement and on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, by (i) pledging to the Collateral Agent the Fixed-Share Rights relating to such number of Separate PACES as is equal to such Separate COVERS and (ii) transferring such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS to the Agent accompanied by a notice to the Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement, stating that the Holder has pledged the relevant amount of Fixed-Share Rights to the Collateral Agent and requesting that the Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledged Common Stock underlying such Separate COVERS, whereupon the Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of the Pledge of the Fixed-Share Rights described in clause (i) above and the instruction described in clause (ii) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will release to the Agent, on behalf of the Holder, such Pledged Common Stock, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and upon receipt thereof the Agent shall promptly: (a) cancel the related Separate PACES and Separate COVERS; (b) transfer the Pledged Common Stock to the Holder; and (c) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver a SPACES Certificate C-9
executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement evidencing the same number of Contracts as were evidenced by the canceled Separate PACES and Separate COVERS. Except as provided in Section 3.14 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, Separate PACES and Separate COVERS shall not be available for re-creating SPACES, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Separate PACES and Separate COVERS may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Separate PACES or Separate COVERS, including the Collateral related thereto. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Payments, if any, payable in respect of each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Certificates) is registered on the Register at the close of business on the Record Date next preceding such Payment Date in such coin or currency of the United States as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payments. The Contract Payments, if any, will be payable at the Corporate Trust Office or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Register or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by a prior written notice by such Person. A Holder shall be entitled to continue receiving Contract Payments after Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of a Variable-Share Repurchase Contract. The Company shall have the right or, at the direction of the Federal Reserve Board, shall be obligated, at any time prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, to defer the payment of any or all of the Contract Payments otherwise payable on any Payment Date, but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Agent written notice of its intention to defer each such Contract Payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of the Securities, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. Any Contract Payments so deferred shall, to the extent permitted by law, accrue additional Contract Payments thereon at the rate of 6.75% per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months), compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Payments, if any, together with the additional Contract Payments, if any, accrued thereon, are referred to herein as the "Deferred Contract Payments"). Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section 5.3 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. No Contract Payments may be deferred to a date that is after the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, and no such deferral period may end other than on a Payment Date. If the Contracts are terminated upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Holder's right to receive Contract Payments, if any, and Deferred Contract Payments will terminate. C-10
In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until a Payment Date prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, then all Deferred Contract Payments, if any, shall be payable to the registered Holders as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding such Payment Date. The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Payments (including any accrued or Deferred Contract Payments) shall be subordinate and junior in right, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, to all Senior Indebtedness. In the event that the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments until the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, each Holder will receive on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, an amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments, payable, at the Company's election, in (i) shares of Common Stock or (ii) Notes. If the Company elects to pay the Deferred Contract Payments in shares of Common Stock, each Holder will receive a number of shares equal to (A) the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Payments payable to such Holder divided by (B) the greater of (x) the Applicable Market Value on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date and (y) $13.20 (as adjusted in a manner consistent with Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement). If the Company elects to issue Notes in payment of the Deferred Contract Payments, such Notes shall have a principal amount equal to the Deferred Contract Payments. In the event the Company defers the payment of Contract Payments, then until the Deferred Contract Payments have been paid, the Company shall not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's Capital Stock other than: (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of the Company's Capital Stock in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of the Company's Capital Stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such Capital Stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the deferral of Contract Payments; (ii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock for any Capital Stock of the Company's subsidiaries, or for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock, or of any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock. The Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of Holders to receive accumulated Contract Payments, if C-11
any, or any Deferred Contract Payments and obligations of the Holders to purchase or sell Common Stock, will immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date or the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, as applicable, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Separate COVERS shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Pledged Common Stock forming a part of such Separate COVERS. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Agent, the Collateral Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Register.

EXHIBIT F FORMULA FOR FIXING VARIABLE-SHARE SETTLEMENT RATE Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate = (5.0505*L - 4.1061*U) ------------------- S L = P*N(A1) - X*N(A2) P = S*e(-D*T) X = 39.600*e(-R*T) A1 = [ln(P/X)-(V2)*T/2]/[V*[GRAPHIC REMOVED HERE]] A2 = A1-V*[GRAPHIC REMOVED HERE] U = P*N(B1) - Y*N(B2) Y = 48.7080*e(-R*T) B1 = [ln(P/Y)-(V2)*T/2]/[V*[GRAPHIC REMOVED HERE]] B2 = B1-V*[GRAPHIC REMOVED HERE] N(.) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. S = The average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock during the 20 consecutive Trading Days beginning on the third Trading Day following the date of the Company's initial notice to the Agent under Section 5.1(c) (the "20-Day Period"). D = The Company's annual dividend yield as a percentage, calculated as (i)(A) the Company's last reported quarterly dividend multiplied by (B) four, divided by (ii) S. R = The annual treasury rate as a percentage, calculated as the yield to maturity on the treasury security maturing on February 15, 2006 (CUSIP No. 912827W81), as of the last Trading Day in the 20-Day Period. The yield to maturity for the treasury security will be the bid side yield displayed at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on the specified date in the Telerate system (or if the Telerate system is no longer available on that date or, in the Company's opinion no longer an appropriate system from which to obtain the yield, such other nationally recognized quotation system as, in the Company's opinion, is appropriate). If this yield is not so displayed, the yield will be calculated by the Company as the yield to maturity for the treasury security, expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days as applicable, and applied on a daily basis, and computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid yields, as of 10:30 a.m. New York City time, on the specified date of three leading United States government securities dealers selected by the Company. If the treasury security maturing on February 15, 2006 (CUSIP No. 912827W81) is no longer outstanding on the specified date, the treasury rate F-1
will be computed as the yield to maturity on the treasury security that matures on the latest date that is on or prior to February 15, 2006. T = The time remaining to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date in years, calculated as of the last Trading Day of the 20-Day Period. V = Annual volatility as a percentage, calculated as the annualized unbiased standard deviation of the logarithmic daily returns on the Common Stock over the 260 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the Company's initial notice to the agent under Section 5.1(c).

Such instructions and entitlement orders may, without limitation, direct the Securities Intermediary to transfer, redeem, assign, or otherwise dispose of 5
the Treasury Strips or Ownership Interests therein, the Fixed-Share Rights, Common Stock, Merger Consideration and any Security Entitlements with respect thereto or sell, liquidate or dispose of such assets through a broker designated by the Company, and to pay and deliver any income, proceeds or other funds derived therefrom to the Company. The Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders from time to time acting through the Purchase Contract Agent, each hereby further authorize and direct the Company or the Collateral Agent, as agent of the Company, to itself issue instructions and entitlement orders, and to otherwise take action, with respect to the Collateral Account, the Collateral credited thereto and any Security Entitlements with respect thereto, pursuant to the terms and provisions hereof, all without the necessity of obtaining the further consent of the Purchase Contract Agent or any of the Holders. The Collateral Agent shall be the agent of the Company only and shall not be the agent of the Holders or the Purchase Contract Agent and shall act only in accordance with the terms hereof or as otherwise directed by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall issue entitlement orders to the Securities Intermediary when and as required by the terms hereof or as otherwise directed by the Company. (b) The Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, for itself and as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Holders, hereby confirm and agree that: (i) all securities or other property underlying any financial assets credited to the Collateral Account shall be registered in the name of the Securities Intermediary, or its nominee, indorsed to the Securities Intermediary, or its nominee, or in blank or credited to another collateral account maintained in the name of the Securities Intermediary and in no case will any financial asset credited to the Collateral Account be registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder, payable to the order of, or specially indorsed to, the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder except to the extent the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the Securities Intermediary or in blank; (ii) all property delivered to the Securities Intermediary pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Treasury Strips, Fixed-Share Rights Certificates, or Common Stock or Merger Consideration) will be promptly credited to the Collateral Account; (iii) the Collateral Account is an account to which financial assets are or may be credited, and the Securities Intermediary shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, treat the Purchase Contract Agent as the "entitlement holder" (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(7) of the Code) with respect to the Collateral Account; (iv) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with any other Person relating to the Collateral Account and/or any financial assets credited thereto pursuant to which it has agreed to comply with entitlement orders of such other Person; and (v) the Securities Intermediary has not entered into, and until the termination of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement with the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of the Securities purporting to limit or 6
condition the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to comply with entitlement orders as set forth in this Section 2.2 hereof. (c) The Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, for itself and as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Holders, hereby agree that each item of property (whether investment property, financial asset, security, instrument, cash or otherwise) credited to the Collateral Account, including any Treasury Strips, Fixed-Share Rights and Common Stock, shall be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the Code. (d) In the event of any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion hereof) and any other agreement now existing or hereafter entered into, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. (e) The Purchase Contract Agent hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent and the Company, and each of them severally, with full power of substitution, as the Purchase Contract Agent's attorney-in-fact to take on behalf of, and in the name, place and stead of, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders, any action necessary or desirable to perfect and to keep perfected the security interest in the Collateral referred to in Section 2.1. The grant of such power-of-attorney shall not be deemed to require of the Collateral Agent any specific duties or obligations not otherwise assumed by the Collateral Agent hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary be responsible for the preparation or filing of any financing or continuation statements in the appropriate jurisdictions or responsible for maintenance or perfection (other than by control) of any Security Interest hereunder. The Collateral Agent agrees to file such financing statements and amendments thereto as the Company may direct from time to time. (f) The Purchase Contract Agent represents and warrants that its chief executive office is located in Columbus, Ohio and that it has more than one place of business.

If the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strips, the Pledged Fixed-Share Right, the Pledged Common Stock or any securities forming a part of Pledged Merger Consideration are reregistered, such that the Collateral Agent becomes the registered holder, all payments and other distributions thereon including payments of the principal of the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strips and payments or other distributions on the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights or the Pledged Common Stock or any securities forming a part of the Pledged Merger Consideration, that are received by the Collateral Agent and that are properly payable or deliverable hereunder, shall be: (i) In the case of (A) payments or other distributions on the Pledged Fixed-Share Right or the Pledged Common Stock or any securities forming a part of Pledged Merger 7

Section 3.2. Application of Payments. All payments or other distributions received by the Purchase Contract Agent as provided herein shall be applied by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Purchase Contract Agent or a Holder of a SPACES or Separate PACES shall receive any payments of principal on account of any Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip that, at the time of such payment, is a Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, the Purchase Contract Agent or such Holder shall hold the same as trustee of an express trust for the benefit of the Company (and promptly deliver the same over to the Company) for application to the obligations of Holders under the related Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, and Holders shall acquire no right, title or interest in any such payments of principal so received or (ii) a Holder of a SPACES shall receive any shares of Common Stock on account of any Fixed-Share Right that, at the time of receipt of such shares, is a Pledged Fixed-Share Right, such Holder shall hold the same for the benefit of the Company and shall promptly deliver the same over to the Purchase Contract Agent, who shall, as attorney-in-fact for such Holder, in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Purchase Contract Agreement, pledge and grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, as collateral security for the performance when due by such Holder of its obligations under the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, a security interest in all of the right, title and interest of the Purchase Contract Agent and such Holder in such Common Stock. 8
ARTICLE IV Substitution, Release, Repledge and Settlement of Securities Section 4.1. Collateral Substitution and the Splitting Apart of SPACES. At any time on or prior to the third Business Day immediately preceding the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, a Holder of SPACES shall have the right to separate the PACES and the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract by substituting a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract (subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement), rounded up to the nearest whole share, for the Pledged Fixed-Share Rights securing such Holder's obligations under the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts comprising a part of such SPACES by (a) Transferring to the Collateral Agent the applicable number of shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment) for each Variable-Share Repurchase Contract being replaced and (b) delivering such SPACES to the Purchase Contract Agent, accompanied by a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit E to the Purchase Contract Agreement, to the Purchase Contract Agent stating that such Holder has transferred Common Stock to the Collateral Agent pursuant to clause (a) above and requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release from the Pledge the Fixed-Share Rights related to such SPACES, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly give such instruction to the Collateral Agent in the form provided in Exhibit D to the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon receipt of Common Stock from a Holder of SPACES and the related instruction from the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent shall release the Fixed-Share Rights and shall promptly Transfer such Fixed-Share Rights, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent. At such point, for each SPACES that is split apart, the Holder will hold a Separate PACES and Separate COVERS.

Section 4.3. Termination Event. (a) Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of written notice from the Company or written notice from the Purchase Contract Agent that has been confirmed in writing by the Company that there has occurred a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release all Collateral from the Pledge and shall promptly Transfer any Pledged Fixed-Share Rights, Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strips, Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities, as applicable, free and clear of any lien, pledge or security interest or other interest created hereby, provided that, if such Termination Event results from the Company being a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the Collateral Agent shall not release any Collateral except upon receipt of an opinion, as provided in Section 4.3(b) hereof or as required by final order of the court with jurisdiction of the Company's case under the Bankruptcy Code. (b) If such Termination Event shall result from the Company becoming a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, and if the Collateral Agent shall for any reason fail promptly to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Collateral, as provided by this Section 4.3, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, in its sole discretion, either: (i) use best efforts to obtain an opinion of a nationally recognized law firm reasonably acceptable to the Collateral Agent addressed to the Company and the Collateral Agent to the effect that, as a result of the Company being the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code, the Collateral Agent will not be prohibited from releasing or Transferring the Collateral as provided in this Section 4.3, and, if such opinion is obtained, shall deliver such opinion to the Collateral Agent within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event, and if (y) the Purchase Contract Agent shall be unable to obtain such opinion within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event or (z) the Collateral Agent shall continue, after delivery of such opinion, to refuse to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Collateral as provided in this Section 4.3, then the Purchase Contract Agent shall within 15 days after the occurrence of such Termination Event commence an action or proceeding in the court with jurisdiction of the Company's case under the Bankruptcy Code seeking an order requiring the Collateral Agent to effectuate the release and Transfer of all Pledged Collateral, as provided by this Section 4.3 or (ii) commence an action or proceeding like that described in subsection (i)(z) hereof within ten days after the occurrence of such Termination Event. Section 4.4. Early Settlement; Merger Early Settlement. Upon written notice to the Collateral Agent by the Purchase Contract Agent that one or more Holders of Securities have elected to effect Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement of their respective obligations under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts or Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts forming a part of such Securities in accordance with the terms of the Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement (setting forth the number of such Contracts as to which such Holders have elected to effect such Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement), and that the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holders, and paid or delivered to the Company, as confirmed to the Collateral Agent in writing by the Company, in the case of the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts, 10
the related Early Settlement Amounts or Merger Early Settlement Amounts, as the case may be, and in the case of the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, Common Stock as specified in Section 5.9(c) of the Purchase Contract Agreement or Merger Consideration as specified in Section 5.10(b) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, as applicable, in each case pursuant to the terms of the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts or the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, as applicable, and the Purchase Contract Agreement and that all conditions to such Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be, have been satisfied, then: (i) in the case of a Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, (A) the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge the Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip and shall Transfer such Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, free and clear of the Pledge created hereby, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the applicable Holders and (B) if the Fixed-Share Purchase Contract being settled forms a part of a SPACES, and the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is not also being settled, the Purchase Contract Agent, as attorney-in-fact of the Holder of such Fixed-Share Purchase Contract, shall Pledge to the Collateral Agent, out of the shares of Common Stock deposited with the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of such Holder in connection with Early Settlement or Merger Early Settlement (subject to Section 5.9(j) of the Purchase Contract Agreement), a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Maximum Variable-Share Settlement Rate (subject to adjustment under Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement), rounded up to the nearest whole share, in order to secure such Holder's obligation to sell Common Stock under the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract; and (ii) in the case of a Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (A) if the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is held as a component of SPACES, the Fixed-Share Right, and (B) if the Variable-Share Repurchase Contract is held as a component of a Separate COVERS, the Pledged Common Stock, and shall Transfer such Pledged Fixed-Share Rights or Pledged Common Stock, as applicable, to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the applicable Holders (subject to the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement). Section 4.5. Application of Proceeds; Collateral Insufficiency. (a) In the event a Holder has not made an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement of the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts underlying its Securities prior to the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts from the proceeds received in respect of the related Pledged Ownership Interests in the Ownership Interest in the maturing Treasury Strips. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the Collateral Agent shall apply such proceeds to the settlement of such Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts on the Fixed-Share Stock Purchase Date. (b) In the event a Holder has not made an Early Settlement or a Merger Early Settlement of the Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts underlying its securities prior to the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to satisfy its delivery obligations thereunder with the Pledged Common Stock or the Pledged Merger Consideration, as applicable. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the 11
Collateral Agent shall apply such Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration to the settlement of such Variable-Share Repurchase Contract on the Variable-Share Stock Purchase Date. Upon receipt of an Issuer Order, the Collateral Agent shall be authorized to dispose of any Pledged Common Stock or any securities forming a part of Pledged Merger Consideration to the extent necessary to make a cash payment in respect of a fractional share. Any Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration in excess of the product of (y) a number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Merger Consideration) equal to the Variable-Share Settlement Rate times (z) the number of Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts being settled, and any excess cash resulting from the disposition by the Collateral Agent of Collateral in order to make a cash payment in respect of a fractional share, shall be delivered by the Collateral Agent to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts. (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an event occurs that requires the Settlement Rates to be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, no Proceeds with respect to Collateral received in connection with such an event shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders, and all such Proceeds shall be held by the Collateral Agent as Collateral, until such time as the Company determines, in accordance with this Section 4.5(c), that a Collateral Insufficiency (as defined below) does not exist or has been cured. Upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company shall forthwith determine, in consultation with the Collateral Agent, whether the Collateral then securing Separate COVERS is still sufficient to satisfy in full a Holder's delivery obligations thereunder (an insufficiency of Collateral being referred to as a "Collateral Insufficiency"). The Company shall specify in the Company Certificate deliverable to the Collateral Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement whether a Collateral Insufficiency exists. The Collateral Agent shall forthwith send to each applicable Holder a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (a "Collateral Insufficiency Notice"), requesting that such Holder cure the Collateral Insufficiency within five Business Days of receipt of the Collateral Insufficiency Notice by delivering to the Purchase Contract Agent, for Pledge to the Collateral Agent by the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact of such Holders, additional Common Stock such that, thereafter, the Pledged Common Stock per Variable-Share Repurchase Contract shall equal the Variable-Share Settlement Rate or, if in effect prior thereto, the Fixed Variable-Share Settlement Rate, as adjusted pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. If the Holder does not cure the Collateral Insufficiency within five Business Days of receiving the Collateral Insufficiency Notice, upon receipt of an Issuer Order the Collateral Agent shall undertake to sell the Proceeds of the Collateral received by it in connection with the event triggering the adjustment to the Settlement Rates, and use the proceeds of such sale to purchase the type and amount of Collateral necessary to cure the Collateral Insufficiency. If the Collateral Agent is unable to cure the Collateral Insufficiency as described above, the Proceeds of the Collateral received in connection with the event triggering the adjustment to the Settlement Rates shall be retained by the Collateral Agent as Collateral and, upon settlement of the related Variable-Share Repurchase Contract, an amount thereof, based on its fair market value at the time of settlement, equal to the Applicable Market Value of the Collateral deficiency shall be delivered to the Company on the applicable Settlement Date. If requested by the Collateral Agent or as otherwise necessary, a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm shall be retained by the Company to ascertain the fair market value of such Proceeds at the time of settlement. If a Holder or the Collateral 12
Agent cures the Collateral Insufficiency, any Collateral held by the Collateral Agent in excess of that necessary to fully secure a Holder's delivery obligations under a Variable-Share Repurchase Contract shall be delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of such Holder in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the obligations of each Holder of COVERS to deliver Common Stock pursuant to the underlying Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts are non-recourse obligations and shall be satisfied solely out of the Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of such Holders under such Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts and in no event will such Holders be liable for any deficiency between such Collateral and the applicable Settlement Rate. ARTICLE V Voting Rights -- Pledged Common Stock Section 5.1. Exercise by Purchase Contract Agent. The Purchase Contract Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Common Stock or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement; provided, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not exercise or, as the case may be, shall not refrain from exercising such right if, in the judgment of the Company, such action would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Common Stock; and provided, further, that the Purchase Contract Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Common Stock, including notice of any meeting at which holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents or proxies of holders of Common Stock, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Common Stock (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Common Stock. ARTICLE VI Rights and Remedies Section 6.1. Rights and Remedies of the Collateral Agent. (a) In addition to the rights and remedies available at law or in equity, after an event of default under the Fixed-Share Purchase Contracts or Variable-Share Repurchase Contracts, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code (or any successor thereto) as in effect in the State of New York from time to time (the "Code") (whether or not the Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to 13
which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to any section of the Code, such reference shall be deemed to include a reference to any provision of the Code, which is a successor to, or amendment of, such section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) retention of the Pledged Collateral in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Contracts or (ii) sale of the Collateral in one or more public or private sales, in each case at the written direction of the Company. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of any Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, Pledged Fixed-Share Right, Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration as provided in Article III hereof in satisfaction of the obligations of the Holder of the Securities of which such Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, Pledged Fixed-Share Right, Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration, as applicable, is a part under the related Contracts, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an event of default under the applicable Contracts and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Ownership Interest in the Treasury Strip, Pledged Fixed-Share Right, Pledged Common Stock or Pledged Merger Consideration, as applicable, and such obligations of such Holder, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Code and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise provided herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments and other distributions (i) of the principal amount of the Pledged Ownership Interests in the Treasury Strips, or (ii) on the Pledged Common Stock or the Pledged Merger Consideration, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article III, and as otherwise granted herein. (d) The Purchase Contract Agent, individually and as attorney-in-fact for each Holder of Securities, agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Company or the Collateral Agent, such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Company or the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Company or the Collateral Agent (acting upon the written request of the Company) hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent act, its own grossly negligent failure to act, its bad faith or its own willful misconduct. Section 6.2. Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute the Fixed-Share Rights or Common Stock, as the case may be, for Collateral held by the Collateral Agent, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby. 14
ARTICLE VII Representations and Warranties; Covenants Section 7.1. Representations and Warranties. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby represent and warrant to the Collateral Agent, which representations and warranties shall be deemed repeated on each day a Holder Transfers Collateral that: (a) such Holder has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on the Collateral; (b) such Holder is the sole beneficial owner of the Collateral and, in the case of Collateral delivered in physical form, is the sole holder of such Collateral and is the sole beneficial owner of, or has the right to Transfer, the Collateral it Transfers to the Collateral Agent, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, call, liability to pay money or other restriction other than the security interest and lien granted under Section 2.1; (c) upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any Intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to Section 2.2); and (d) the execution and performance by the Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under Section 2.1 or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets. Section 7.2. Covenants. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Purchase Contract Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby covenant to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge: (a) neither the Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holders will create or purport to create or allow to subsist any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge or any other security interest whatsoever over the Collateral or any part of it other than pursuant to this Agreement; and (b) neither the Purchase Contract Agent nor such Holders will sell or otherwise dispose (or attempt to dispose) of the Collateral or any part of it except for the beneficial interest therein, subject to the pledge hereunder, transferred in connection with the Transfer of the Securities. 15
ARTICLE VIII The Collateral Agent Section 8.1. Appointment, Powers and Immunities. (a) The Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, and Securities Intermediary shall each act as agent for the Company hereunder with such powers as are specifically vested in the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary: (i) shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth or incorporated in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be inferred from this Agreement against any of them, nor shall any of them be bound by the provisions of any agreement by any party hereto beyond the specific or incorporated terms hereof; (ii) shall not be responsible for any recitals contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by it under, this Agreement, the Securities or the Purchase Contract Agreement (except as specifically incorporated by reference herein), or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as against the Collateral Agent), the Securities or the Purchase Contract Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein (except as specifically incorporated by reference herein) or therein or for any failure by the Company or any other Person (except the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be) to perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or for the, priority or, except as expressly required hereby, existence, validity, perfection or maintenance of any security interest created hereunder; (iii) shall not be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder (except in the case of the Collateral Agent, pursuant to directions furnished under Section 8.2, subject to Section 8.6); (iv) shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; and (v) shall not be required to advise any party as to selling or retaining, or taking or refraining from taking any action with respect to, the Securities or other property deposited hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, during the term of this Agreement, the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, and Securities Intermediary shall take all reasonable action in connection with the safekeeping and preservation of the Collateral hereunder. (b) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur 16
any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder. In no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary be liable for any amount in excess of the value of the Collateral, except for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Section 8.2. Instructions of the Company. The Company shall have the right, by one or more instruments in writing executed and delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for the realization of any right or remedy available to the Collateral Agent, or of exercising any power conferred on the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, or to direct the taking or refraining from taking of any action authorized by this Agreement; provided, however, that (i) such direction shall not conflict with the provisions of any law or of this Agreement and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall receive indemnity satisfactory to it as provided herein. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall impair the right of the Collateral Agent in its discretion to take any action or omit to take any action which it deems proper and which is not inconsistent with such direction.

The provisions of this Section and Section 10.7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary and the termination of this Agreement. Section 8.9. Failure to Act. In the event of any ambiguity in the provisions of this Agreement or any dispute between or conflicting claims by or among the parties hereto or any other Person with respect to any funds or property deposited hereunder, then at its sole option, each of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled, after prompt notice to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, to refuse to comply with any and all claims, demands or instructions with respect to such property or funds so long as such dispute or conflict shall continue, and the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall not be or become liable in any way to any of the parties hereto for its failure or refusal to comply with such conflicting claims, demands or instructions. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall be entitled to refuse to act until either: (a) such conflicting or adverse claims or demands shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or settled by agreement between the conflicting parties as evidenced in a writing satisfactory to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary; or (b) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall have received security or an indemnity satisfactory to it sufficient to save it harmless from and 19
against any and all loss, liability or reasonable out-of-pocket expense which it may incur by reason of its acting. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may in addition elect to commence an interpleader action or seek other judicial relief or orders as the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary may deem necessary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall be required to take any action that is in its opinion contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, or which would in its opinion subject it or any of its officers, employees or directors to liability. Section 8.10. Resignation of Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary. (a) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary as provided below: (i) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent as attorney-in-fact for the Holders of Securities; (ii) the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may be removed at any time by the Company; and (iii) if the Securities Intermediary fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder in any material respect for a period of not less than 20 days after receiving written notice of such failure by the Purchase Contract Agent and such failure shall be continuing, the Securities Intermediary may be removed by the Purchase Contract Agent, acting at the direction of the Holders of Securities. The Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any notice of grounds for removal of the Securities Intermediary pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 8.10. Upon any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the Company shall have the right to appoint a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, which shall not be an Affiliate of the Purchase Contract Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's giving of notice of resignation or the Company's or the Purchase Contract Agent's giving notice of such removal, then the retiring or removed Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary may petition any court of competent jurisdiction, at the expense of the Company, for the appointment of a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary shall each be a bank or a national banking association which has an office (or an agency office) in New York City with a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, such 20
successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, and the retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, as the case may be, shall take all appropriate action, subject to payment of any amounts then due and payable to it hereunder, to transfer any money and property held by it hereunder (including the Collateral) to such successor, and shall follow the Company's instructions, if any, to ensure that the perfection of the Pledge is not affected thereby. The retiring Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary shall, upon such succession, be discharged from its duties and obligations as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder. After any retiring Collateral Agent's, Custodial Agent's or Securities Intermediary's resignation hereunder as Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, the provisions of this Article 8 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary. Any resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary hereunder, at a time when such Person is acting as the Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent or Securities Intermediary, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement as the simultaneous resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, Securities Intermediary or Custodial Agent, as the case may be. Section 8.11. Right to Appoint Agent or Advisor. The Collateral Agent shall have the right to appoint agents or advisors in connection with any of its duties hereunder, and the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by, or in reliance upon the advice of, such agents or advisors selected in good faith. The appointment of agents pursuant to this Section 8.11 shall be subject to prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Section 8.12. Survival. The provisions of this Article 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary. Section 8.13. Exculpation. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary or their officers, directors, employees or agents be liable under this Agreement to any third party for indirect, special, punitive, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not limited to, lost profits, whether or not the likelihood of such loss or damage was known to the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary, or any of them and regardless of the form of action. ARTICLE IX Amendment Section 9.1. Amendment Without Consent of Holders. Without the consent of any Holders, the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, at any time and from time to time, may amend 21
this Agreement, in form satisfactory to the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the Purchase Contract Agent, for any of the following purposes: (i) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company, and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Company herein; (ii) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders, or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company so long as such covenants or such surrender do not adversely affect the validity, perfection or priority of the security interests granted or created hereunder; (iii) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, Custodial Agent, Securities Intermediary or Purchase Contract Agent; or (iv) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provisions herein which may be inconsistent with any other such provisions herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to such matters or questions arising under this Agreement, provided such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders. Section 9.2. Amendment With Consent of Holders. With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the total Contracts at the time outstanding voting together as one class, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent and the Securities Intermediary may amend this Agreement for the purpose of modifying in any manner the provisions of this Agreement or the rights of the Holders in respect of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security adversely affected thereby, (i) change the amount or type of Collateral underlying a Security (except as contemplated by Article IV of this Agreement), impair the right of the Holder of any Security to receive distributions on the underlying Collateral or otherwise adversely affect the Holder's rights in or to such Collateral; or (ii) otherwise effect any action that would require the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement if such action were effected by an agreement supplemental thereto; or (iii) reduce the percentage of such Contracts the consent of whose Holders is required for any such amendment. It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof. Section 9.3. Execution of Amendments. In executing any amendment permitted by this Section, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary and the 22
Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 6.1 hereof, with respect to the Collateral Agent, and Section 7.1 of the Purchase Contract Agreement, with respect to the Purchase Contract Agent) shall be fully protected in relying upon, a Company Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Agreement and that all conditions precedent, if any, to the execution and delivery of such amendment have been satisfied and, in the case of an amendment pursuant to Section 9.1, that such amendment does not adversely affect the validity, perfection or priority of the security interests granted or created hereunder. Section 9.4. Effect of Amendments. Upon the execution of any amendment under this Article IX, this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such amendment shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes; and every Holder of Certificates theretofore or thereafter authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered under the Purchase Contract Agreement shall be bound thereby. Section 9.5. Reference To Amendments. Certificates authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered after the execution of any amendment pursuant to this Article IX may, and shall if required by the Collateral Agent or the Purchase Contract Agent, bear a notation in form approved by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent as to any matter provided for in such amendment. If the Company shall so determine, new Certificates so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Collateral Agent, the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company, to any such amendment may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered by the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with the Purchase Contract Agreement in exchange for outstanding Certificates. ARTICLE X Miscellaneous Section 10.1. No Waiver. No failure on the part of any party hereto or any of its agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party hereto or any of its agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. Section 10.2. Governing Law.

We are rendering this supplemental opinion in connection with the prospectus supplements to the Prospectus dated January 14, 2002 (the "Prospectus Supplements") filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) promulgated under the Securities Act.

Said opinions are satisfactory in form and scope, and we are of the opinion that you and we may properly rely thereon as to such matters. Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that: 1.

At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you. For purposes of giving the opinions hereinafter set forth, our examination of documents has been limited to the examination of originals or copies of the following: (a) The Certificate of Trust of the Trust, dated as of March 25, 1998 (the "Certificate"), as filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") on March 25, 1998; (b) The Trust Agreement of the Trust, dated as of March 25, 1998, among the Corporation, as depositor, and the trustees of the Trust named therein; (c) The Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust, dated as of January 21, 2003 (including Exhibits A, C and D thereto) (the "Trust Agreement"), among the Corporation, the trustees of the Trust named therein (collectively, the "Trustees"), and the several holders, from time to time, of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust;

Initially capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are used as defined in the Trust Agreement. The Original Prospectus, as supplemented by the Supplement, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus." For purposes of this opinion, we have not reviewed any documents other than the documents listed above, and we have assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that bears upon or is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own but rather have relied solely upon the foregoing documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects. With respect to all documents examined by us, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as authentic originals, (ii) the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies or forms, and (iii) the genuineness of all signatures. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed (i) that the Trust Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof, including with respect to the creation, operation, and termination of the Trust, and that the Trust Agreement and the Certificate are in full force and effect and have not been amended, (ii) except to the extent provided in paragraph 1 below, the due creation, due formation or due organization, as the case may be, and valid existence in good standing of each party to the documents examined by us under the laws of the jurisdiction governing its creation, formation or organization, (iii) the legal capacity of each natural person who is a party to the documents examined by us, (iv) except to the extent provided in paragraph 3 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, such documents, (v) except to the extent provided in paragraph 4 below, that each of the parties to the documents examined by us has duly authorized, executed and delivered such documents, (vi) the receipt by each Person to whom a Trust Security is to be issued by the Trust (the "Holders") of an appropriate Trust Securities Certificate for such Trust Security, and the payment for the Trust Security acquired by it, in accordance with the
To Each of the Persons Listed on Schedule I Hereto January 21, 2003 Page 3 Trust Agreement and the Prospectus, (vii) that the Trust Securities are issued and sold to the Holders in accordance with the Trust Agreement and the Prospectus, (viii) that the Trust derives no income from or connected with sources within the State of Delaware and has no assets, activities (other than having a Delaware trustee as required by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, 12 Del. C. (S) 3801, et seq. (the "Statutory Trust Act") and the filing of documents with the Secretary of State) or employees in the State of Delaware, (ix) that the Delaware Trustee satisfies the requirements of (S)3807(a) of the Statutory Trust Act, and (x) that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. We have not participated in the preparation of the Prospectus and assume no responsibility for its contents. This opinion is limited to the laws of the State of Delaware (excluding the securities laws of the State of Delaware), and we have not considered and express no opinion on the laws of any other jurisdiction, including federal laws and rules and regulations relating thereto. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to Delaware laws and rules, regulations and orders thereunder that are currently in effect. Based upon the foregoing, and upon our examination of such questions of law and statutes of the State of Delaware as we have considered necessary or appropriate, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and exceptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that: 1. The Trust has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act and, under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the trust power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business, all as described in the Prospectus, and all filings required under the laws of the State of Delaware with respect to the creation and valid existence of the Trust as a statutory trust have been made. 2. The Trust Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Corporation and the Trustees, and is enforceable against the Corporation and the Trustees, in accordance with its terms, and the terms of the Capital Securities as set forth in the Trust Agreement, to the extent they are obligations of the Trust, are valid and binding obligations of the Trust in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement. 3. Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the Trust has the trust power and authority to (i) execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement and (ii) issue and perform its obligations under the Trust Securities. 4. Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement and the performance by the Trust of its obligations thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary trust action on the part of the Trust. 5. The Capital Securities have been duly and validly authorized for issuance under the Trust Agreement and, when issued and delivered against payment therefor as provided
To Each of the Persons Listed on Schedule I Hereto January 21, 2003 Page 4 in the Trust Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and, subject to the qualifications set forth in this paragraph 5, fully paid and nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust and will be entitled to the benefits provided by the Trust Agreement. Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the issuance of the Capital Securities is not subject to preemptive rights. The Holders of the Capital Securities, as beneficial owners of the Trust, will be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We note that the Holders of the Capital Securities may be obligated, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, to (i) provide indemnity or security in connection with and pay taxes or governmental charges arising from transfers or exchanges of Capital Securities Certificates and the issuance of replacement Capital Securities Certificates and (ii) provide security or indemnity in connection with requests of or directions to the Property Trustee to exercise its rights and remedies under the Trust Agreement. 6. The Common Securities have been duly and validly authorized by the Trust Agreement. Under the Statutory Trust Act and the Trust Agreement, the issuance of the Common Securities is not subject to preemptive rights. 7. The issuance and sale by the Trust of the Trust Securities, the execution and delivery by the Trust of the Underwriting Agreement, the compliance by the Trust with all of the provisions of the Capital Securities, the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, the consummation by the Trust of the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and the Underwriting Agreement, and the purchase by the Trust of the Debentures in the circumstances contemplated by the Trust Agreement will not violate (i) any of the provisions of the Certificate or the Trust Agreement or (ii) any applicable Delaware law, rule or regulation. 8. No authorization, approval, consent or order of any Delaware court or governmental authority or agency is required to be obtained by the Trust solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Trust Securities. 9. The Holders of the Capital Securities (other than those Holders of the Capital Securities who reside or are domiciled in the State of Delaware) will have no liability for income taxes imposed by the State of Delaware solely as a result of their participation in the Trust, and the Trust will not be liable for any income tax imposed by the State of Delaware. The opinions expressed in paragraph 2 above are subject, as to enforcement, to the effect upon the Trust Agreement of (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, (ii) principles of equity, including applicable law relating to fiduciary duties (regardless of whether considered and applied in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) the effect of applicable public policy on the enforceability of provisions relating to indemnification or contribution. We consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also consent to your relying as to matters of Delaware law upon this opinion in connection
To Each of the Persons Listed on Schedule I Hereto January 21, 2003 Page 5 with the Underwriting Agreement.
