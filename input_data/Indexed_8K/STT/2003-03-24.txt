State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) announced today that it expects reported earnings per share to be approximately $0.27-$0.29 in the first quarter of 2003. Reported results in 2003 will include State Street's operating results of $0.45-$0.47; results from the first two months of the acquired Deutsche Bank GSS business, including related financing costs ($0.03); previously announced one-time charges associated with that acquisition ($0.07); and the previously announced one-time charge resulting from recently enacted Massachusetts REIT tax legislation ($0.08). Excluding the results of the corporate trust business, which was sold in 2002, State Street's anticipated first-quarter operating earnings per share will represent a decline of 10%-13% versus the first quarter of 2002.
BOSTON, MA  March 20, 2003 
 
Revenue generation was lower than State Street's expectations and expenses increased from the levels of the fourth quarter. State Street attributes its lowered revenue projections primarily to a compression of interest rate spreads, which have had a negative effect on both net interest and securities lending revenues. Also contributing to the revenue shortfall were a decline in equity market valuations and a larger-than-expected slowdown in cross-border investing.
 
Commenting on the announcement, David A. Spina, chairman and chief executive officer of State Street, said, "To address this adverse environment, we are systematically reducing spending during the second quarter to reflect the lower level of revenue. We are planning to implement operational efficiencies that involve system consolidations as well as staff reductions and delays in hiring. Meanwhile, we are maintaining spending required to support our clients' needs and are continuing to invest in business initiatives that are essential to our strategy for long-term growth. We are strengthening our presence in Europe, expanding our investment servicing capabilities
 
 
to meet the needs of hedge funds and wealth managers, and extending our considerable trading franchise to include equities."
 
Spina continued, "Our integration of Deutsche Bank's Global Securities Services business is on track. We will provide an update on our progress in April. Client conversions commenced immediately after the January 31 close of the acquisition, and our planned cost reductions are on schedule with the global integration blueprint we put into effect last month."
 
Spina concluded, "Although first-quarter results will be below our expectations, we remain confident about our long-term strategy and outlook. Our unique focus on meeting the needs of sophisticated global investors, our leadership in this growing market and our solid financial position will enable us to remain relatively strong over the short term and to grow vigorously in the future."
