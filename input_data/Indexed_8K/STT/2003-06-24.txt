This presentation includes discussion of State Street Corporation's financial and business goals and strategies, which may be perceived as "forward-looking statements" as defined by Federal Securities Laws. Actual results could differ materially, and there can be no assurance that goals will be achieved. For a discussion of some of the factors that may affect State Street's goals, please see the 2002 annual report and subsequent SEC filings, especially the sections captioned "Financial Goals and Factors That May Affect Them," and any subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
