EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit - ------- 99.1 Form of press release dated October 14, 2003

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Announces Third-Quarter Results Operating profit up 27% driven by revenue growth and expense reduction; Global Securities Services integration on track State Street Corporation announced today third-quarter earnings per share of $0.60, representing net income of $202 million on revenue of $1,126 million. Results for the third quarter include pre-tax merger and integration costs of $26 million related to the Global Securities Services business (GSS), as well as pre-tax restructuring charges of $3 million due to State Street's previously announced expense-reduction program, for a combined after-tax charge of $0.06 per share. In reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2003, State Street has prepared information in four categories: -- "Reported" results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). -- "Operating" results are "reported" results excluding restructuring and merger-related charges. They are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. -- "GSS contribution" results are the revenue and expenses, including financing costs and amortization of intangibles, attributable to the GSS business acquired on January 31, 2003, as well as revenue and expenses from "out-of-scope" GSS business that are closely related to Deutsche Asset Management, but that were not part of the acquisition. Per-share amounts reflect the effect on outstanding shares due to the acquisition. -- "Baseline" results are "operating" results excluding "GSS contribution" and are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. State Street believes that providing non-GAAP financial information assists investors and others by providing them with financial information in a format that provides comparable financial trends of ongoing business activities. Baseline earnings per share were $0.65, up 20% compared to baseline earnings per share of $0.54 for the third quarter of 2002, and up 25% from $0.52 in the second quarter of 2003. Third quarter of 2002 baseline results exclude $8 million of pre-tax income, or $0.02 per share, attributable to the Corporate Trust business divested at the end of 2002. Baseline revenue of $976 million was up 3% from the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to increases in servicing and management fees, processing and other fees, and foreign exchange, partially offset by a loss on the sale of securities and lower net interest revenue. In the third quarter, the GSS business contributed $163 million in total revenue: $155 million of fee revenue, $10 million in "out-of-scope" fee revenue, and $3 million of interest revenue, offset by interest expense of $5 million attributable to the acquisition financing. The GSS business earned $0.01 in the third quarter on a per-share basis, including the "out-of-scope" results, the cost of financing and the impact of increased shares outstanding, but excluding one-time merger and acquisition costs. Operating earnings per share, which exclude the merger and integration and restructuring charges recorded in the third quarter of 2003, were $0.66, up 22% from $0.54 a year ago, and up 27% from $0.52 in the second quarter of 2003. Operating revenue increased 20%, or $190 million, to $1,139 million from the third quarter of 2002. Operating return on stockholders' equity was 17.4% for the quarter. The following table summarizes State Street's baseline, GSS, operating, and reported results for the third quarters of 2002 and 2003. Detailed information is available in the Addendum Selected Financial Information tables included with this press release.

Spina, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am very pleased with our third quarter results. Our success in integrating the Global Securities Services business at the same time that we reduced our expenses and continued to win new business, demonstrates the depth of State Street's experience in managing complex business requirements. I am proud of our employees and their clear commitment to our clients and our company. "We are maintaining the high level of client service and innovation that institutional investors have come to expect from State Street. At the same time, we are making operations cost efficient and thereby creating value for our stockholders. We are laying an ever-stronger foundation for State Street's profitable growth." THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS VS. SECOND QUARTER On a reported basis, third quarter net income per share of $0.60 compares to a net loss per share of $0.07 in the second quarter, which included the impact of the corporate restructuring charge. Total revenue in the third quarter of $1,126 million is up 4% versus $1,082 million in the second quarter. On a baseline basis, third-quarter net income of $0.65 per diluted share is up 25% from $0.52 per share. Revenue rose 2%, from $958 million to $976 million, while expenses declined $39 million, or 6%, to $650 million, in line with the previously stated expense reduction target. THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER On a reported basis, the third-quarter income per share was $0.60, reflecting net income of $202 million, and total revenue of $1,126 million. In the third quarter of 2002, State Street earned $182 million, or $0.56 per share, on $956 million in revenue. On an operating basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Net income was $225 million, and revenue was $1,139 million. In the third quarter of 2002, net income was $177 million, or $0.54 per share, on revenue of $949 million. On a baseline basis, third-quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.65, net income was $211 million, and revenue was $976 million. In the third quarter of 2002, net income was $177 million, or $0.54 per share, on revenue of $949 million. State Street generates revenue by providing sophisticated global investors with integrated products, services and strategies that support their investment and business goals. The following review of specific revenue and expense lines uses baseline results to provide consistent comparable data to the year-earlier period. Servicing fees are derived from accounting, administration, custody, daily pricing, performance and analytics, compliance monitoring, and operations outsourcing for investment managers. Baseline servicing fees were up 8%, to $400 million from $371 million. The increase was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new clients. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index were up 12% from the third quarter of 2002; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) were up 7%. Total assets under custody were $8.8 trillion, including $2.0 trillion attributable to the GSS business. Baseline investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $137 million, up 17% compared to $116 million a year ago. Management fees reflected continued new business success, complemented by an increase in average month-end equity valuations. Total assets under management were $965 billion, compared to $707 billion the previous year. Baseline foreign exchange trading revenue was $89 million for the quarter, compared to $78 million a year ago. The increase was attributable to improved volume reflecting higher cross-border investment activities. Baseline processing fees and other increased $21 million to $61 million due to improved performance of joint ventures, structured products and tax-advantaged financings. A loss of $5 million on sales of securities compared with a gain of $31 million. Baseline net interest revenue was $218 million, a decline of $19 million, or 8%, from a year ago. Lower yields on reinvested assets drove the decrease in net interest revenue. State Street provides repurchase agreements and deposit services for clients' investment activities, which generate net interest revenue. Baseline operating expenses were $650 million, down $19 million, or 3%, from $669 million a year ago. Lower salaries and benefits expenses and direct controllable expenses were due to the previously announced cost-reduction plans. As previously announced, the increase in occupancy reflects the cost associated with new office space. GSS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION UPDATE Based on the third quarter 2003 operations, the business as acquired, excluding "out-of-scope" revenue and expenses, is generating approximately $628 million of annualized revenue and about $520 million of annualized expenses. With most GSS clients having determined their service provider, we now expect to retain approximately 90% of the available client revenue acquired, which excludes "out-of-scope" revenue. State Street expects to meet its target in reducing GSS expenses in the acquired business. To date, State Street has completed 465 client conversions. After eight months of operation, the GSS business, excluding "out-of-scope" results and one-time costs, is operating at break even; we therefore believe we will meet or slightly better our previously announced expectation of $0.01 to $0.03 dilution per share for the year. The merger and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition in 2003 totaled $81 million for the first three quarters. EXPENSE CONTROL MEASURES The company has successfully reduced its workforce this year, now totaling 19,850 which includes the employees related to the GSS business. The Company first announced the expense reduction program in April 2003. Commenting on the program, David A. Spina, chairman and chief executive officer, said: "The short term goals of this program were largely achieved in the third quarter and we expect to receive continuing benefits in the future. Since revenue has resumed growing in the last several quarters, it is likely we may incur some increase in variable costs in the near term."
