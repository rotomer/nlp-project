Boston, MA ... January 13, 2004
 
State Street Corporation announced today fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.33, equivalent to net income of $447 million on revenue of $1.5 billion. For the full-year 2003, earnings per share were $2.15 and net income was $722 million on revenue of $4.7 billion.
 
Results for the fourth quarter of 2003 include a gain on the sale of State Street's Private Asset Management business of $285 million or $0.56 in diluted earnings per share, the gain on the settlement of the residual escrow from the 2002 sale of Corporate Trust business of $60 million or $0.12 diluted earnings per share and merger, integration and divestiture costs of $29 million or $0.06 in diluted earnings per share.
 
Results for the full year 2003 include the $345 million of gains from the sale of the Private Asset Management business and the Corporate Trust escrow settlement, or $0.68 in diluted earnings per share, restructuring costs related to an expense-reduction program of $296 million or $0.58 in diluted earnings per share, full year merger, integration and divestiture costs of $110 million, or $0.22 in diluted earnings per share, and the impact of a real estate loss and settlement of a state tax issue that combined for a $0.06 reduction in full year diluted earnings per share.
 
For the fourth quarter of 2002, earnings per share were $1.46 equivalent to net income of $477 million on revenue of $1.5 billion. For the full-year 2002, earnings per share were $3.10 and net income was $1.0 billion on revenue of $4.4 billion. Results for the fourth quarter of 2002 and the full year 2002 include a gain of $495 million or $0.90 in diluted earnings per share from the December 31, 2002 sale of the Corporate Trust business.

For 2003, return on stockholders equity was 13.9% compared to 24.1% for 2002.
 
In reporting its financial results, State Street has prepared information in four categories:
 
 
 
 
 
State Street believes that providing non-GAAP financial information assists investors and others by providing them with financial information in a format that provides comparable financial trends of ongoing business activities.
 
Baseline earnings per share were $0.69, up 28% compared to baseline earnings per share of $0.54 for the fourth quarter of 2002, and up 6% from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2003. Fourth quarter of 2002 baseline results exclude $10 million of pre-tax income, or $0.02 per share, attributable to the Corporate Trust business divested at the end of 2002. Baseline revenue of $1.0 billion for Q4 2003 was up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily due to increases in servicing and management fees, processing and other fees, and foreign exchange, partially offset by a loss on the sale of securities and lower net interest revenue.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the GSS business contributed $168 million in total revenue: $157 million of fee revenue, $9 million in "out-of-scope" fee revenue, and $7 million of interest revenue, offset by interest expense of $5 million attributable to the acquisition financing. Included in GSS revenue was $19 million in FX revenue due to a contract settlement negotiated with Deutsche Bank. The GSS business earned $0.02 in the fourth quarter on a per-share basis, including the "out-of-scope" results, the cost of financing and the impact of increased shares outstanding, but excluding merger and integration charges.
 
Operating earnings per share in the fourth quarter 2003, which exclude the merger and integration charges and the gains related to the sale of the divested businesses, was $0.71, up 31% from $0.54 a year ago, and up 8% from $0.66 in the third quarter of

2003. Operating revenue increased 23%, or $221 million, to $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2002 and was up $34 million, or 3% from the third quarter of 2003. Return on stockholders' equity on an operating basis was 17.2% for the quarter and 15.0% for the year. Operating earnings for the year 2003 were $2.33, compared to $2.16 in 2002.
 
The following table summarizes State Street's baseline, GSS, operating, and reported results for the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2003. Detailed information is available in the Addendum Selected Financial Information tables included with this press release.

David A. Spina, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "2003 was a challenging yet very productive year for us. We won significant new business; we managed expenses aggressively; and we met or exceeded all the commitments we made for integration of the GSS business. We also continued to deliver superior service to our clients  which is always our number one goal.

"We expect 2004 to be another challenging year for our industry. Although economic conditions seem to be improving, the business environment is still extremely fragile and interest rates are at 50-year lows. Competition continues to be intense, especially in the pension markets, and sales cycles are longer than we've seen in the past. Costs related to compensation, technology, and occupancy will go up in 2004. Our goal is to balance our near-term profit objectives with strategic investments in State Street's future."

FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER
 
On a reported basis, the fourth-quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.33, reflecting net income of $447 million, and total revenue of $1.5 billion, including the gains from the divested businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2002, State Street earned $477 million, or $1.46 per share, on $1.5 billion in revenue, including the gain from the divested business.
 
On an operating basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Net income was $239 million, and revenue was $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2002, net income was $174 million, or $0.54 per share, on revenue of $952 million.

The following review of specific revenue and expense lines uses baseline results to provide consistent comparable data to the year-earlier period.
 
Servicing fees are derived from accounting, administration, custody, daily pricing, performance and analytics, compliance monitoring, and operations outsourcing for investment managers. Baseline servicing fees were up 16%, to $426 million from $369 million. The increase was attributable to higher equity market valuations and new business from existing and new clients. Daily average values for the S&P 500

were up 27%. Total assets under custody were $9.4 trillion, including $2.1 trillion attributable to the GSS business.
 
Baseline investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $133 million, up 14% compared to $116 million a year ago. Management fees reflected continued new business success and an increase in average month-end equity valuations. Total assets under management were $1.1 trillion, compared to $763 billion the previous year.
 
Baseline foreign exchange trading revenue was $81 million for the quarter, compared to $62 million a year ago. The increase was attributable to improved volume and volatility, reflecting higher cross-border investment activities.
 
Baseline processing fees and other increased $18 million to $70 million due to the mark-to-market gain on SPACES

pursuant to FAS 150, improved performance of joint ventures and structured products' business, offset by recognition of other-than-temporary impairment charges on asset-backed investment securities.
 
Baseline net interest revenue was $220 million, a decline of $16 million, or 6%, from a year ago. Lower yields on reinvested assets drove the decrease in net interest revenue. A loss of $6 million on sales of securities compared with a gain of $31 million from the year ago quarter.
 
Baseline operating expenses were $655 million, down $36 million, or 5%, from $691 million a year ago. Lower salaries and benefits expenses and direct controllable expenses were due to the previously announced cost-reduction plans, partly offset by an increase in information systems and communications and transaction processing services

GSS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION UPDATE
 
After eleven months of operation, the GSS business, including "out-of-scope" results and excluding one-time costs, reported a profit of $0.01 per share, exceeding our expectation of $0.01 to $0.03 dilution per share.
 
With most GSS clients having selected STT as their service provider, we now expect to retain approximately 88% of the available client revenue acquired, which excludes "out-of-scope" revenue. To date, State Street has completed about 550 client conversions.
 
The pretax merger and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition in 2003 totaled $103 million, within STT's estimated range $90-$110 million. Client conversion will continue and will be substantially complete by the end of 2004. The Company
