STATE STREET CORPORATION /s/ Frederick P. Baughman ------------------------- Name: Frederick P. Baughman Title: Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Date: April 13, 2004
EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit - ------- 99.1 Form of press release dated April 13, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Announces First-Quarter Results BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 13, 2004--State Street Corporation announced today first-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.63, or net income of $217 million, on revenue of $1.2 billion. These results compare to earnings per diluted share of $0.29, or net income of $96 million, on revenue of $1.0 billion in the first quarter of last year. Total expenses in the first quarter of 2004 of $908 million are up $74 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Results for the first quarter of 2004 include pre-tax merger and integration costs of $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share due to the continuing integration of the Deutsche Bank Global Securities Services business (GSS), acquired in January, 2003. Results for the first quarter of 2003 included pre-tax merger and integration costs of $37 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to the GSS acquisition and an after tax charge of $25 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to a tax matter with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. First quarter 2003 results also include the operating results of the divested Private Asset Management business. For the first quarter of 2004, return on stockholders' equity was 14.8% compared to 10.0% for 2003. In reporting its financial results, State Street has prepared information in two categories: -- "Reported" results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). -- "Operating" results are "reported" results excluding merger and integration costs, the impact of the state tax matter in 2003, and the results of divested businesses. They are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. State Street believes that non-GAAP financial information assists investors and others by providing them with financial information in a format that presents comparable financial trends of ongoing business activities. Operating earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.67, up 56% compared to operating earnings per share of $0.43 for the first quarter of 2003. Operating results for 2003 have been reduced from the previously reported $0.44 per share reflecting the impact of the divested Private Asset Management business. Operating revenue of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2004 was up 21% from the first quarter of 2003, primarily due to increases in servicing and management fees, foreign exchange, brokerage fees, and processing fees and other, offset in part by lower securities gains. Operating expenses of $890 million in the first quarter of 2004 were up $105 million, or 13%, from the first quarter of 2003. This comparison reflects two months of recorded operating activity for the GSS business acquired on January 31, 2003, compared with three full months in 2004. Return on stockholders' equity on an operating basis was 15.6% for the quarter. The following table summarizes State Street's reported and operating results for the first quarters of 2004 and 2003. Detailed information is available in the Addendum Selected Financial Information tables included with this press release.

(b) excludes merger and integration costs, the results of the divested Private Asset Management business, and the impact of a state tax matter, presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. David A. Spina, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am pleased with our first-quarter performance. We are winning a significant amount of new business, both from new clients and from clients with whom we have long-term relationships. We are beginning to see additional large wins in our investment management outsourcing business and our equity execution business is growing at a very encouraging pace. State Street Global Advisors continues to achieve excellent results. The integration of the Global Securities Services business is continuing to run smoothly and is on track with regard to timing and our financial projections. The acquisition of GSS was truly transformational for State Street in strengthening our leadership position in Europe. I believe we're also balancing our near-term objective of cost containment with our need to make long-term strategic investments. Based on our first-quarter results, I am confident that we are stronger than ever and well positioned for the future." FIRST QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER The following review of specific revenue and expense categories uses operating results to provide consistent comparable data to the year-earlier period. Servicing fees were up 27%, to $555 million from $438 million. The increase was attributable to the extra month of GSS revenue, higher equity market valuations, and new business from existing and new clients in 2004. Total assets under custody were $9.4 trillion, up 19%, compared with $7.9 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index were up 32% from the first quarter of 2003; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) were up 46%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $147 million, up 36% compared to $108 million a year ago. Management fees reflected an increase in average month-end equity valuations and continued new business success. Total assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 58%, compared to $788 billion the previous year. Securities lending revenue was $64 million in the quarter, compared to $55 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 16%. The increase in securities lending revenue reflects a 35% improvement in volume of securities lent, partially offset by significantly narrower interest-rate spreads. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $118 million for the quarter, compared to $72 million a year ago, a 63% increase. The increase was attributable to significantly higher volatilities, reflecting higher cross-border investment activities by our clients, and improved volumes. Brokerage fees were $45 million in the first quarter, up 51% from $30 million a year ago due to an increase in transition management and growth in electronic trade execution. Processing fees and other increased $15 million, or 21% to $84 million primarily due to improved performance of the company's joint ventures. Net interest revenue was $214 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 1%, from a year ago. Net interest revenue from leveraged leases in the first quarter of 2004 included a $19 million reduction in interest income due to a change in the applicable state tax rate. This charge was partially offset by an increase in net interest revenue resulting from a larger average balance sheet during the quarter. Gains on the sale of securities of $3 million compares with gains of $26 million from the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses increased from $785 million to $890 million, up $105 million, or 13%. Approximately half of the increase was due to the extra month of GSS operations in 2004. Higher salaries and benefits expenses were due to increased incentive compensation. The increase in expenses also included higher transaction processing services, due to substantially higher brokerage volumes and higher occupancy expenses. On an operating basis, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2004 was 30%, compared to 35% in the first quarter of 2003. The reduced effective state tax rate in the first quarter was due to an $18 million benefit related to the leveraged lease state tax rate adjustment. State Street's estimated full-year tax rate including this adjustment is 33%, and is estimated to be 34% excluding this adjustment. FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER On a reported basis, first-quarter net income per diluted share of $0.63, which included $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share of merger and integration charges, compares to a net income per diluted share of $1.33 in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2003 results included a gain of $0.56 per diluted share on the sale of the Private Asset Management business and $0.12 per diluted share due to the settlement of the residual escrow from the 2002 sale of the Corporate Trust business, offset by $0.06 per diluted share in merger and integration charges. Total revenue in the first quarter of $1.2 billion is down 19% versus $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter which included $345 million in gains on the sale of divested businesses. Total expenses in the first quarter of $908 million are up $80 million compared to the fourth quarter. On an operating basis, first-quarter net income of $228 million, or $0.67 per share, is down 6% from $239 million, or $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter. First quarter 2004 included a gain of $4 million resulting from the final mark-to-market of a variable share repurchase contract entered into in conjunction with the GSS acquisition, compared with a mark-to-market gain of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Fourth quarter 2003 results also included $19 million due to a settlement of a foreign exchange matter with Deutsche Bank associated with the GSS operations. Revenue rose from $1.17 billion to $1.23 billion and expenses rose from $795 million to $890 million. GSS ACQUISITION UPDATE On an operating basis, State Street's 2004 first-quarter results include $0.02 earnings per share, after finance charges, on revenues of $160 million and expenses of $138 million, associated with the GSS business. The first quarter of 2003 reflected a loss of $0.02 in earnings per share after finance charges, on revenues of $92 million and expenses of $92 million, excluding merger and integration costs. The first quarter of 2003 represented two months of recorded activity compared with the full quarter of activity in 2004. To date, State Street has completed about 70% of the world-wide client conversions, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2004. The pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition in the first quarter of 2004 totaled $18 million. The Company expects pretax merger and integration costs related to these conversions to be about $50 to $60 million this year.
