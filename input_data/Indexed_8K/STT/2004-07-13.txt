EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit 99.1 Form of press release dated July 13, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Announces Second-Quarter Results BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 13, 2004--State Street Corporation today announced second-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.65, or net income of $220 million, on revenue of $1.29 billion. These results compare to a loss per diluted share of $0.07, or $23 million, on revenue of $1.08 billion in the second quarter of last year. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2004 were $953 million compared to $1.14 billion in the year-ago quarter. Results for the second quarter of 2004 include pre-tax merger and integration costs of $16 million, or $0.03 per diluted share due to the continuing integration of the Deutsche Bank Global Securities Services business (GSS), acquired in January 2003. Results for the second quarter of 2003 included pre-tax merger and integration costs of $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the GSS acquisition, as well as restructuring costs, a loss on the sale of certain real estate, and a settlement of a state tax legislation issue, resulting in a net charge of $0.55 per diluted share. Second quarter 2003 results also included the operating results of the divested Private Asset Management business. For the second quarter of 2004, return on stockholders' equity was 14.9%. In reporting its financial results, State Street has prepared information in two categories: -- "Reported" results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). -- "Operating" results are reported results in 2004 excluding merger and integration costs and in 2003 excluding merger and integration costs, restructuring costs, the loss on the sale of certain real estate, the settlement of a state tax legislation issue, and the results of a divested business. They are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. State Street believes that non-GAAP financial information assists investors and others by providing them with financial information in a format that presents comparable financial trends of ongoing business activities. Operating earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were $0.68, up 36% compared to operating earnings per diluted share of $0.50 for the second quarter of 2003. Operating results for 2003 have been reduced by $0.02 per diluted share reflecting the impact of the divested Private Asset Management business. Operating revenue of $1.30 billion in the second quarter of 2004 was up 19% from the second quarter of 2003, primarily due to increases in servicing fees, management fees, and net interest revenue. Operating expenses of $937 million in the second quarter of 2004 were up $119 million, or 15%, from the second quarter of 2003. Return on stockholders' equity on an operating basis was 15.7% for the quarter. The following table summarizes State Street's reported and operating results for the second quarters of 2004 and 2003. Detailed information is available in the Addendum Selected Financial Information tables included with this press release.

(b) excludes restructuring charges, merger and integration costs, the loss on the sale of certain real estate, the settlement of a state tax legislation issue, and the results of a divested business, presented on a tax-equivalent basis. Ron Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "State Street's strategy - focusing on being the best provider of services to institutional investors around the world - continues to drive our company's growth. Much of my energy is going into ensuring that we execute on this strategy extremely well. By delivering consistent value to our customers, we will achieve our goals of becoming the undisputed leader in our target markets and delivering sustainable growth to our stockholders." Commenting on the quarter, he added, "Favorable market conditions in the first quarter continued into the second, helping us to achieve record operating revenue. The results of the second quarter were solid due to strong revenue growth across all segments of our business. However, market conditions may not be as favorable in the second half of the year. We expect to face downward pressure on revenue in the short term, due to anticipated increases in interest rates, among other things. We also expect to incur implementation expenses related to converting several large new customers in Europe. Continued improvement above initial expectations for the Deutsche Bank GSS business, however, is expected to partially offset these increases." SECOND QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER The following review of specific revenue and expense categories uses operating results to provide consistent comparable data to the year-earlier period. Operating revenue of $1.30 billion in the second quarter of 2004 was up $210 million or 19% from the second quarter of 2003. Servicing fees were $570 million, up $88 million or 18%, from $482 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to new business from existing and new clients and to higher equity market valuations in 2004. Total assets under custody were $9.1 trillion, up 7%, compared with $8.5 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $153 million, up $42 million, or 38%, compared to $111 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in management fees also reflected new business from existing and new clients and higher equity market valuations in 2004. Total assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 35%, compared to $901 billion the previous year. Average month-end values for the S&P 500 Index were up 18% from the second quarter of 2003; average month-end values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) were up 32%. Securities lending revenue was $89 million in the quarter, compared to $76 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 17%. The increase reflects a 31% improvement in volume of securities on loan. Both quarters' results represent seasonally high activity. Foreign exchange trading revenue was $116 million for the quarter, compared to $103 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. The increase was attributable to higher volatilities, reflecting higher cross-border investment activity levels by our clients. Brokerage fees were $36 million in the quarter, compared to $27 million in the year-ago quarter, up 33% due to an increase in transition management fees and in the volume of electronic equity trading. Net interest revenue was $238 million, up $32 million or 16% from $206 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase was attributed to an increase in balance sheet size and a steepening in the short-term end of the yield curve. Gains on the sale of securities of $16 million compares with gains of $8 million from the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses of $937 million in the second quarter of 2004 were up $119 million or 15% from the second quarter of 2003. Salaries and benefits expenses increased $72 million to $510 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation resulting from the Corporation's improved operating performance. Higher expenses also included an increase of $24 million in transaction processing services, due to higher volume-driven expenses, and an increase of $22 million in other expense driven primarily by increased professional services expenses needed to support growth initiatives and compliance requirements. The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2004 was 34%, compared to 37% in the second quarter of 2003, excluding the impact of the REIT adjustment. SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS VS. FIRST QUARTER On a reported basis, second-quarter net income per diluted share of $0.65, which included $16 million, or $0.03 per diluted share of merger and integration charges, was up 3% compared to first quarter net income per diluted share of $0.63, which included $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share of merger and integration charges. Total revenue in the second quarter of $1.29 billion was up 6% versus $1.22 billion in the first quarter. Total expenses in the second quarter of $953 million were up 5% or $45 million compared to $908 million in the first quarter. On an operating basis, second-quarter net income per diluted share was $0.68 compared to first quarter net income per diluted share of $0.67. Revenue increased 6% to $1.30 billion from $1.23 billion and expenses increased 5% to $937 million from $890 million. GSS ACQUISITION UPDATE On an operating basis, State Street's 2004 second-quarter results included $0.02 earnings per share, after finance charges, on revenues of $158 million and expenses of $131 million, which includes "out-of-scope" GSS business. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 earnings per diluted share totaled $0.04. Based on current estimates, State Street believes that the total GSS business will contribute between $0.06 to $0.08 in earnings per diluted share for 2004. To date, State Street has completed about 80% of the world-wide client conversions, and we expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2004, excluding Germany. The pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition in the second quarter of 2004 were $16 million and total $34 million for the six months. The corporation expects pre-tax merger and integration costs related to these conversions to be approximately $50 to $60 million in the current year.
