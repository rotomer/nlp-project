This presentation includes discussion of State Street Corporation's financial and business goals and strategies, which may be perceived as "forward-looking statements" as defined by federal securities laws.  Actual results could differ materially, and there can be no assurance that goals will be achieved.  For a discussion of some of the factors that may affect State Street's results, please see the Corporation's 2003 annual report on Form 10-K, especially the section captioned "Financial Goals and Factors That May Affect Them," and any subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  Presentations used today are based upon the Corporation's "operating basis" results.  For a reconciliation of the Corporation's results on an operating basis to results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, please refer to investorrelations.statestreet.com.
