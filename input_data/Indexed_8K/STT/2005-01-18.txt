Exhibit 99.1 State Street Achieves Solid Growth in Revenues and Earnings Per Share in 2004 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 18, 2005-- Performance Driven by Strong New Business Growth, Improved Fee Revenue, and Expanded Geographic Reach State Street Corporation today announced 2004 fourth-quarter reported earnings per share of $0.55, or net income of $184 million on revenue of $1.27 billion. These results compare to earnings of $1.33 per share, or net income of $447 million on revenue of $1.51 billion in the fourth quarter of 2003. The 2003 fourth-quarter results included a $0.68 per share gain on the sale of certain businesses. This pretax gain of $345 million was reported in 2003 fourth-quarter revenue. For the fourth quarter of 2004, return on stockholders' equity on a reported basis was 11.9%. In the fourth quarter of 2004 operating earnings per share were $0.57, compared to $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Several items affected operating earnings per share in each period. In the fourth quarter of 2004, operating earnings were reduced by the cost of the reduction in force ($21 million or $0.04 per share) and a loss on a sub-tenant agreement ($16 million or $0.03 per share), and increased by a reduction in the loan loss provision ($18 million or $0.04 per share). These items resulted in an aggregate reduction of $0.03 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the company's operating earnings of $0.71 included $0.04 per share gain from a FX contract settlement with Deutsche Bank ($18 million) and a $0.07 per share mark-to-market after- tax gain on SPACES(SM) ($23 million), aggregating an increase of $0.11 per share. Total operating revenue of $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004 was up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2003, principally due to strength in servicing and management fees, and included an $18 million reduction in the loan loss provision. The fourth quarter of 2004 was up 8% from $1.18 billion in the third quarter of 2004 due to a rebound in foreign exchange, brokerage, and securities lending revenue. Total expenses on an operating basis of $980 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, including the $21 million cost of the reduction in force and $16 million due to the loss on a sub-tenant arrangement, were up from $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 and up from $890 million in the third quarter of 2004. Return on stockholders' equity on an operating basis was 12.4% for the fourth quarter of 2004. Reported earnings for the full-year 2004 amounted to $2.35 per share, or net income of $798 million on revenue of $4.95 billion. This result compares to 2003 earnings per share of $2.15, or net income of $722 million on revenue of $4.73 billion. The 2004 results include $62 million for merger and integration costs or $0.12 per share; in 2003, merger, integration and divestiture costs, restructuring charges, and other charges total to $419 million, or $0.82 per share, plus a $0.04 reduction in earnings per share due to the settlement of a state tax issue; and 2003 results include a gain of $345 million, or $.68 per share, on the sale of two businesses and $23 million, or $0.04 per share, attributable to related operating results. Total reported expenses were $3.76 billion in 2004 compared to $3.62 billion in 2003. Total return on stockholders equity on a reported basis was 13.3% in 2004 and 13.9% in 2003. Operating earnings for the full-year 2004 amounted to $2.47 per share, or net operating income of $839 million. This result compares to 2003 operating earnings per share of $2.29, or net operating income of $768 million. Total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was up 14%, from $4.39 billion to $5.00 billion, compared to the same period a year ago. Operating expenses for same period were $3.70 billion, an increase of 16% from $3.18 billion in the year-ago period. Return on equity on an operating basis for 2004 was 14.0% and 14.8% in 2003. Commenting on the performance, Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "In 2004 State Street again demonstrated its ability to grow its operating revenue--up 14% from 2003, with strength across the company, particularly in servicing and management fees. We also saw strong business growth in both Europe and Asia Pacific fueled in part by the expanded footprint we gained from the successful GSS acquisition and increased customer demand in those regions for an integrated bundle of investment services. At the same time, operating earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year and, in the second half of the year, we made progress toward more efficiently managing expenses and allocating resources. " Logue concluded, "We will continue to balance our objectives for growth with delivering consistency in operating earnings per share in a slow growth environment. While we may not produce positive operating leverage every quarter, prudent expense management will be a continuing focus. Having announced our 2005 goals in November 2004, we expect operating earnings per share growth of 10-15%, operating revenue growth of 8-12%, and an operating return on equity of 14-17%. In 2005, we continue to expect to deliver at the lower end of this range based on the current environment." State Street purchased approximately 4 million shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter at an average price of $43.37 per share. The Company's remaining authorization to purchase shares is now approximately 4.3 million shares. FOURTH-QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Total operating revenue of $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, which includes $18 million for the reduction in the loan loss provision, was up from $1.17 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter of 2003 which included the $18 million FX contract settlement with Deutsche Bank and the $23 million mark-to-market after-tax gain on SPACES(SM) referenced above. Servicing fees were $570 million, up $45 million or 9%, from $525 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to new business from existing and new clients and higher equity valuations in 2004. Total assets under custody were $9.5 trillion, a record level, up 1%, compared with $9.4 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $167 million, up $34 million, or 26%, compared to $133 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in management fees reflects new business from existing and new clients and higher equity valuations in 2004. Total assets under management were at a record level, $1.4 trillion, up 22%, compared to $1.1 trillion in the previous year. Average month-end values for the S&P 500 Index were up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2003; average month-end values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) were up 18%. Securities lending revenue was $58 million in the quarter, compared to $53 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 9%. The increase reflects higher volumes of 16%, offset by reduced spreads. Foreign exchange trading revenue of $111 million in the quarter, declined 3%, or $4 million from $115 million in the year-ago quarter because the fourth quarter of 2003 included the $18 million FX contract settlement with Deutsche Bank. This decrease was partially offset by increased volumes and volatility in the fourth quarter of 2004. Brokerage fees were $43 million in the quarter, compared to $37 million in the year-ago quarter, up 16% due to increases in transition management. Net interest revenue was $229 million, up 3% from $222 million in last year's fourth quarter, due to balance sheet growth driven by a higher level of customer's deposits, offset by reduced spreads. Net interest revenue, after provision for loan losses, was $247 million, which included an $18 million reduction in the loan loss provision. Total expenses on an operating basis of $980 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, which included the impact of the loss on a sub-tenant agreement and cost of the reduction in force, were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2003. Salaries and benefits expenses increased $75 million to $511 million, driven principally by the higher incentive compensation, option expenses, merit increases, and benefits costs. Expenses for transaction processing increased $21 million to $104 million due to increased volumes. Higher expenses also included a $33 million increase in occupancy, primarily due to the impact of the $16 million loss on a sub-tenant arrangement, and an increase of $45 million in other expense driven primarily by increased professional services expenses needed to support growth initiatives and compliance requirements. The effective tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003. FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS VS. THIRD QUARTER On a reported basis, fourth-quarter net income per share of $0.55, which included $12 million, or $0.02 per share of merger and integration charges, was up 6%, or $0.03, compared to third quarter net income per share of $0.52, which included $16 million, or $0.03 per share of merger and integration charges. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of $1.27 billion was up 8% versus $1.17 billion in the third quarter. Total expenses in the fourth quarter of $992 million were up 9%, or $86 million, compared to $906 million in the third quarter. On an operating basis, fourth-quarter net income per share was $0.57, compared to third-quarter net income per share of $0.55. Total operating revenue increased 8% from $1.18 billion in the third quarter to $1.28 billion, including the reduction in the loan loss provision. Total expenses on an operating basis increased 10% from $890 million to $980 million, which included the loss on a sub-tenant agreement and costs of the reduction in force. Market-driven revenue was particularly strong--with foreign exchange increasing 48% to $111 million, and brokerage increasing 39% to $43 million. Securities lending revenue also strengthened to $58 million, up from $48 million or 21%. Salaries and benefits were up 8% due to increased incentive compensation and transaction processing increased 9% due to volumes. GSS ACQUISITION UPDATE Fourth-quarter operating results for 2004 included $0.02 earnings per share, after finance charges, on revenue of $141 million and expenses of $118 million, which includes "out-of-scope" GSS business. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, operating earnings per share totaled $0.10 on revenue of $606 million. Merger and integration costs for the fourth quarter were $12 million and totaled $62 million in 2004. FINANCIAL INFORMATION In reporting its financial results, State Street has prepared information in two categories: -- "Reported" results are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). -- "Operating" results are reported results for the three- and twelve-month periods in 2004 excluding merger and integration costs, and for the three- and twelve-month periods in 2003 excluding gains on the sale of divested businesses, merger, integration and divestiture costs, restructuring costs, and the operating results of a divested business, and for the twelve-month period in 2003, the loss on the sale of certain real estate and the settlement of a state tax legislation issue. Operating results are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis. State Street believes that non-GAAP financial information assists investors and others by providing them with financial information in a format that presents comparable financial trends of ongoing business activities.
