State Street Corporation announced today that the Company's proxy statement, first distributed to stockholders beginning yesterday, relating to the Company's 2005 annual meeting to be held on April 20, 2005 had an error in the summary compensation table.  The 2004 bonus for Ronald E. Logue, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, did not reflect a deferred bonus of $1,500,000 awarded to him in his prior role as President and Chief Operating Officer in June 2004, and paid in January 2005, for the successful integration of the Global Securities Services business acquired by the Company from Deutsche Bank A.G.   Including this amount, the total 2004 bonus for Mr. Logue should read $2,800,000.  The Company is distributing supplemental proxy information to its shareholders correcting the error beginning early next week.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
