Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Reports Strong EPS Growth from Continuing Operations on Year-over-Year 18% Revenue Increase; Reports Decline in Expenses Compared to Second Quarter BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2005--State Street Corporation announced today third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.75. This result is up 44% from $0.52 in last year's third quarter, which included $0.03 per share for merger and integration costs associated with the acquisition of a substantial portion of Deutsche Bank's Global Securities Services (GSS) business. Revenue of $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2005 is up 18%, or $214 million, compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Total expenses in the third quarter of 2005 of $1.0 billion are up 11%, or $102 million, compared to $906 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income from continuing operations is $250 million, up 41% or $73 million from $177 million in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter of 2005, return on stockholders' equity from continuing operations is 15.9% compared to 11.7% in the third quarter of 2004. Including results from discontinued operations due to the charge for the divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisors, net income in the third quarter of 2005 is $143 million, or $0.43 per share. Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We are very pleased with the results of the quarter for a number of reasons. First, our year-over-year servicing and management fee revenue growth continues to be strong, driven in part by new business and deepening relationships with existing customers. Second, we are managing our expenses more carefully showing no growth from the last quarter and thirdly, as a result of these two accomplishments, we were able to better manage the effect of the seasonality of market driven revenue." Logue concluded, "Directionally I am very pleased with where we are heading. Our results this quarter, as well as our healthy new business pipeline, position us to achieve our financial goals for the year. We continue to target positive operating leverage for the full year. While we continue to expect to achieve at the lower end of our revenue goal, we now expect our growth in earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately in the middle of the 10 percent to 15 percent range and our return on equity from continuing operations to be approximately in the middle of the 14 percent to 17 percent range. As we move into the fourth quarter, our momentum is positive, and we are beginning to show the results of the actions we undertook at this time last year." THIRD QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Servicing fees are up 9%, to $620 million from $568 million in last year's third quarter. The increase is attributable to new business from existing and new clients in 2005 and higher equity market valuations. Total assets under custody are $9.8 trillion, up 9%, compared with $9.0 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 11% from the third quarter of 2004; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 19%. The average values for the NASDAQ are up about 15%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $188 million, up 21% from $156 million a year ago. Management fees reflect continued new business and an increase in average month-end equity valuations. Total assets under management are a record $1.4 trillion, up 14%, compared to $1.2 trillion the previous year. Securities lending revenue is $74 million in the quarter, up 54% compared to $48 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting improved spreads and increased volume. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $176 million for the quarter, up 59% from $111 million a year ago. The increase was driven by improved volumes and increased volatility in foreign exchange as well as strong transition management business. Processing fees and other revenue was relatively flat, down $1 million to $77 million. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $245 million, an increase of $22 million from $223 million a year ago. The increase in net interest revenue is attributable to improved yields and a larger investment portfolio, offset partially by a flatter yield curve. The Company also recorded a $16 million gain from the final settlement of the 2003 sale of its Private Asset Management business. Expenses increased from $906 million to $1,008 million, up $102 million, or 11%. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 19% to $566 million, primarily due to the impact of 593 employees added from the three investment management operations outsourcing contracts last year and increased incentive compensation due to improved results. Expenses for information systems & communications declined $10 million, or 8%, to $117 million due to reductions related to the conversion of GSS business. The increase in expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 17% to $111 million, partially due to higher volumes in the brokerage business. Occupancy expense increased 9%, or $8 million, to $96 million. Other expenses rose 11%, or $12 million, to $118 million. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 34.0% in both quarters. In September 2005, State Street committed to a plan to divest its ownership interest in Bel Air Investment Advisors. Accordingly, State Street accounted for Bel Air separately as a discontinued operation and recorded a pre-tax charge of $165 million and an income tax benefit of $58 million in the third-quarter results. State Street purchased approximately 3.1 million shares of its common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $48.50 per share. The remaining authorization to purchase shares is 9.7 million shares. THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS VS. SECOND QUARTER Third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $0.75 per share compares to $0.66 in the second quarter, an increase of 14%. Total revenue in the third quarter of $1.39 billion is up 2% from $1.36 billion in the second quarter. Total expenses were down 2%, or $20 million, to $1,008 million from $1,028 million in the second quarter, which included a $26 million charge for a sublease agreement. Return on stockholders' equity from continuing operations of 15.9% in the third quarter compares with 14.4% in the second quarter. Servicing fees are up $2 million to $620 million, and management fees are up 9% to $188 million due to new business and an increase in equity valuations. Securities lending revenue decreased 35%, from $113 million to $74 million, reflecting seasonal strength in the second quarter. Revenue from trading services increased 4%, or $7 million to $176 million. Processing fees and other revenues are up $7 million, or 10%, from $70 million to $77 million. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis increased $17 million, or 7%, to $245 million from $228 million, due to improved yields from the securities portfolio, offset somewhat by a flatter yield curve. Salaries and employee benefits total $566 million, an increase of $14 million, or 3%, from $552 million, due to increased incentive compensation from the improved results. Occupancy decreased 16%, or $18 million, to $96 million primarily due to the impact of the $26 million charge taken in the second quarter for a subleasing agreement. Other expenses are down $11 million, or 9%, from $129 million to $118 million primarily due to a reduction in fees for professional services.
