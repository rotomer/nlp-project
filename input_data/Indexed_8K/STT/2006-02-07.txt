Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Form of supporting exhibits outlining the presentations made on February 7, 2006.
We prepare our consolidated statement of income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or "GAAP."  In order to provide information on a comparable basis from period to period and assist shareholders, analysts and other external parties and management in analyzing financial results and trends of ongoing businesses and operations, we present supplemental information on an "operating" basis.  Operating-basis results are based on GAAP results, excluding the impact of significant, non-recurring transactions and activities, presented on a taxable-equivalent basis.  We believe that such supplemental non-GAAP financial information facilitates an understanding and analysis of our ongoing activities and provides financial information in a format the presents comparable financial trends.
 
The presentation made to analysts and investors on February 7, 2006, provides information on our operating-basis results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Following is a reconciliation of GAAP results to operating-basis results of operations.
 
 
(1) Taxable-equivalent adjusted revenue is a method of presentation in which the tax savings achieved by investing in tax-exempt securities are included in interest income with a corresponding charge to income tax expense.  This method provides better comparability between the performance of tax-exempt and taxable securities.  The adjustment is computed using a federal income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit.
 
(2) Merger and integration costs related to the acquisition of a substantial portion of the Global Securities Services business of Deutsche Bank AG.

This presentation includes discussion of State Street Corporation's financial and business goals and strategies, which may be perceived as "forward-looking statements" as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results could differ materially, and there can be no assurance that goals will be achieved. For a discussion of some of the factors that may affect State Street's results, please see the Corporation's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K, especially the section captioned "Financial Goals and Factors That May Affect Them," and any subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Those statements are based on current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the pace at which State Street adds new clients or at which existing clients use additional services, the value of global and regional financial markets, the pace of cross-border investment activity, changes in interest rates, the pace of worldwide economic growth and rates of inflation, the extent of volatility in currency markets, consolidations among clients and competitors, State Street's business mix, the dynamics of markets State Street serves, and State Street's success at integrating and converting acquisitions into its business.  Presentations used today are based upon the Corporation's "operating basis" results. For a reconciliation of the Corporation's results on an operating basis with results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, please refer to http://investorrelations.statestreet.com.
