EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- --------------- 99.1 News release dated April 18, 2006, announcing first quarter 2006 results of operations and related financial information.

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Announces EPS from Continuing Operations up 25% on a 16% Revenue Increase to a Record $1.5 Billion in First Quarter of 2006; Strong Performance across All Business Units BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2006--State Street Corporation announced today first-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.84, up 25% from $0.67 in last year's first quarter driven by strong revenue growth as well as positive operating leverage. In addition, State Street recognized a $0.03 gain from discontinued operations related to finalizing costs associated with the divestiture of Bel Air Investment Advisors. Record revenue of $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2006 is up 16%, or $215 million, compared to $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Total expenses in the first quarter of 2006 of $1.1 billion are up 13%, or $130 million, compared to $966 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income from continuing operations of $282 million was up $56 million, or 25% from $226 million a year ago. For the first quarter of 2006, return on shareholders' equity was 17.6% compared to 15.0% in the first quarter of 2005. Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am very pleased with our overall results. Our fee revenue continues to be strong across all business units and geographies, especially management fees from State Street Global Advisors. In addition, we benefited from favorable foreign exchange and equity markets. Our net interest revenue and net interest margin also increased due to the continuing execution of our balance sheet strategy. "Based on the outlook for interest rates, we may face pressure from rising rates later this year, and we also need to continue to work hard at moderating our rate of expense growth. Looking to the rest of the year, we are well positioned to achieve our previously stated goals for revenue and earnings per share growth, as well as return on equity. If the current strength continues, our results for the full year may be above the middle of the respective ranges." FIRST QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Servicing fees are up 10%, to $657 million from $599 million in last year's first quarter. The increase is attributable to new business from existing and new clients in 2006 and higher equity market valuations. Total assets under custody are $10.7 trillion, up 13%, compared with $9.5 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 8% from the first quarter of 2005; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 17%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $220 million, up 24% from $177 million a year ago. Management fees reflect continued new business, an increase in average month-end equity valuations, and higher performance fees. Total assets under management are $1.5 trillion, up 12%, compared to $1.4 trillion the previous year. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $230 million for the quarter, up 38% from $167 million a year ago. The increase in foreign exchange was due to stronger volumes and a favorable mix, offset by weaker volatilities. Strong transition business drove the increase in brokerage fees and other revenue. Securities finance revenue is $81 million in the quarter, up 16% compared to $70 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of securities lent. Processing and other fee revenue was down 14%, or $12 million, due to declines in sub-servicing fees and various other investments, none of which was material. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $277 million, an increase of $54 million, or 24%, from $223 million a year ago. The increase is due to the continued repositioning of the investment portfolio, more favorable deposit pricing, and customer volumes. Expenses increased from $966 million to $1.1 billion, up $130 million, or 13%. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 21% to $635 million, primarily due to the increase in headcount and higher benefit costs, as well as the impact of incentive compensation due to improved performance. The headcount increase includes the addition of 170 staff from the previously announced acquisition of UniverseSoft Technology Company in Hangzhou, China. Expenses for information systems & communications increased $6 million, or 5%, to $132 million due to costs associated with increased global infrastructure costs. The increase in total expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 11% to $120 million, due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business. Other expenses were flat at $116 million. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2006 is 34.0%, the same as the rate in 2005. State Street purchased approximately 2.9 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $61.99 per share. The Corporation's remaining authorization to purchase shares is approximately 15 million shares, an amount recently approved by the Board of Directors. FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER First-quarter net income per share from continuing operations of $0.84 compares to net income per share of $0.74 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14%, driven by strong revenue growth as well as positive operating leverage. Total revenue in the first quarter of $1.523 billion is up 8% versus $1.416 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total expenses are $1.096 billion, up 5% versus $1.039 billion in the fourth quarter. Return on shareholders equity of 17.6% in the first quarter compares with 15.9% in the fourth quarter. Servicing fees are up 3% to $657 million and management fees are up 3% to $220 million primarily due to new business. Trading services revenue is up 26%, from $182 million to $230 million due to strong foreign exchange performance. Securities finance revenue increased 11%, from $73 million to $81 million, due to increased volumes. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $277 million, up from $253 million, or 9%, due to the continued repositioning of the investment portfolio, favorable deposit pricing, and customer volumes. Salaries and employee benefits total $635 million, an increase of $46 million, or 8%, from $589 million due to increased headcount and higher benefit costs, as well as the impact of incentive compensation. More than one third of the increase in our headcount from the fourth quarter was due to the previously announced acquisition of UniverseSoft Technology Company in Hangzhou, China. Transaction processing is up 2% to $120 million due to increased volumes in the investment servicing business, and occupancy is up 4% to $93 million from $89 million due to annual increases in operating costs. Information systems and communications increased 8% from $122 million to $132 million, due to costs associated with increased global infrastructure costs. Other expenses are down $5 million from $121 million to $116 million due to lower professional fees. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per share.
