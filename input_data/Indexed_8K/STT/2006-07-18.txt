EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 News release dated July 18, 2006, announcing second quarter 2006 results of operations and related financial information.

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Announces Record Revenue in Second Quarter, up 21% Compared to 2005; Continues to Achieve Positive Operating Leverage with Strength across All Business Units BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2006--State Street Corporation announced today second-quarter earnings per share of $0.68 which includes non-cash tax charges of $0.25 per share. These charges include $0.18 per share, primarily related to the impact of the recently passed Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act ("TIPRA"), as well as $0.07 per share, related to an increase in the tax provision for the potential resolution of issues with the IRS regarding the treatment of leveraged leases. Excluding these tax charges, earnings per share of $0.93 are up 41% from $0.66 per share in the second quarter of 2005. Record revenue of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2006 is up 21%, or $290 million, compared to $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2006 of $1.2 billion are up 14%, or $148 million, compared to $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. As a result, the Corporation generated significant positive operating leverage. For the second quarter of 2006, return on shareholders' equity including the tax charges is 14.0% and excluding the tax charges is 19.2%. These compare to 14.4% in the second quarter of 2005. Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our strong results across all business units and geographies demonstrate the successful execution of our global strategy. We are particularly pleased with the performance of our investment servicing activities, including the strength in securities finance and foreign exchange. State Street Global Advisors continues to win new business in quantitative active strategies, launch new ETFs, increase its fee revenue, and make a larger contribution to our bottom line. We continue to manage expenses in light of a dynamic market environment. We are pleased that again this quarter we achieved positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue and net interest margin also improved compared to 2005, due to more active balance sheet management." Looking forward, Logue concluded, "The potential effect of higher short-term interest rates in the U.S. in the second half of the year poses a challenge for us. As in past years, we may experience seasonal weakness in certain market-driven revenues in the third quarter. However, excluding the second-quarter tax charges, the strength in the first half of the year increases our confidence that we will achieve at the high end of the ranges we established for the full year." SECOND QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Servicing fees are up 11%, to $683 million from $618 million in last year's second quarter. The increase is attributable to new business from existing and new customers in 2006 and higher equity market valuations. Total assets under custody are $10.9 trillion, up 13%, compared with $9.6 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 8% from the second quarter of 2005; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 25%. The average values for the NASDAQ are up about 11%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $232 million, up 34% from $173 million a year ago. Management fees reflect continued new business, an increase in average month-end equity valuations, and increased performance fees. Total assets under management are $1.5 trillion, up 12%, compared to $1.4 trillion the previous year. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $258 million for the quarter, up 53% from $169 million a year ago. The increase was driven by strength in foreign exchange. Securities finance revenue is $128 million in the quarter, up 13% compared to $113 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in demand, offset partially by a decline in spreads. Both quarters' results represent seasonally high activity. Processing fees and other revenue are up 6% at $74 million. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $275 million, an increase of $47 million from $228 million a year ago. The increase in net interest revenue is due to a favorable mix of deposits as well as growth in the balance sheet due to customer demand. Net interest margin increased to 1.20% from 1.04% a year ago. Expenses increased from $1,028 million to $1,176 million, up $148 million, or 14%. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 24% to $684 million, primarily attributable to incentive compensation due to improved performance, additions to headcount, and increases in planned benefits. Expenses for information systems & communications increased $8 million, or 7%, to $129 million due to infrastructure investments. The increase in expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 20% to $134 million, due to higher volumes. Occupancy expense decreased 17%, or $19 million, to $95 million primarily due to the $26 million charge in 2005 for sub-leasing several floors at the Corporation's headquarters building. Other expenses increased 4% to $134 million from $129 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter is 52.1% including the two previously mentioned charges for the adjustments to federal income taxes, compared with 34.0% in the second quarter of last year. The effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 is expected to be 34.6%. State Street recorded a non-cash tax charge of $59 million, or $0.18 per share, primarily related to recently passed legislation repealing the exclusion from federal income taxation of a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft. The Corporation also recorded an additional tax provision of $24 million, or $0.07 per share, for the potential resolution of issues with the IRS regarding the treatment of lease-in-lease-out ("LILO") and sale-in-lease-out ("SILO") transactions. On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or "FSP," No. FAS 13-2. The FSP requires that the recognition of lease income over the term of a lease be recalculated if there is a change in the expected timing of tax-related cash flows. The adoption of the FSP will result in an after-tax reduction of the opening balance of retained earnings, on January 1, 2007, in the range of $190 million to $240 million. Future income from the affected leases is expected to increase over the remaining terms of the leases by an amount approximately equal to the after-tax reduction. State Street purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock during the second quarter at an average price of $64.74 per share. The remaining authorization to purchase shares is 12.2 million shares. SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS VS. FIRST QUARTER Second-quarter net income per share of $0.93, excluding the $0.25 per share for additional tax provisions, compares to net income per share from continuing operations of $0.84 in the first quarter. Total revenue in the second quarter of $1.7 billion is up 8% versus $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Total expenses are $1.2 billion, up 7% versus $1.1 billion in the first quarter. For the second quarter of 2006, return on shareholders' equity including the tax charges is 14.0% and excluding the tax charges is 19.2%. These compare with 17.6% from continuing operations in the first quarter. Servicing fees are up 4% to $683 million and management fees are up 5% to $232 million due principally to new business. Trading services increased 12% to $258 million due to strength in foreign exchange. Securities finance revenue increased 58%, from $81 million to $128 million, due to seasonally high volumes and improved spreads. Processing fees and other are up slightly from $72 million to $74 million. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis decreased $2 million, or 1%, to $275 million, compared to $277 million in the first quarter. Salaries and employee benefits total $684 million, an increase of $49 million, or 8%, from $635 million, attributable to the impact of incentive compensation due to improved performance and the impact of merit increases. Transaction processing services increased $14 million, or 12%, due to an increase in volumes. Other expenses are up $18 million, or 16%, from $116 million to $134 million primarily in support of new business and growth initiatives.
