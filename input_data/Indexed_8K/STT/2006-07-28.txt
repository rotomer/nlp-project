Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On July 24, 2006, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") notified State Street Corporation (the "Company") in writing that the Company's disclosure in its most recent proxy statement did not fully satisfy the NYSE's interpretation of its Commentary to Section 303A.03 of the Listed Company Manual.  The Commentary requires the Company to disclose a method for interested parties to communicate directly with its presiding director or the non-management directors as a group.
The Company's proxy disclosure set forth the procedure for communicating with the Lead Director and directed interested parties to a website at which current contact information is maintained.  The Company's website provides a number of methods for contacting the Lead Director, including through a live internet link at the website, as well as details on the more traditional telephone and mail methods.  The NYSE determined that the Company's inclusion of the contact information on the website rather than in the proxy statement is inconsistent with its interpretive position which does not permit incorporation by reference in complying with Section 303A.  While the Company believes that its proxy disclosure satisfies Section 303A.03, the Company is making this filing on Form 8-K to satisfy the concerns of the NYSE.  The Company has been advised by the NYSE that this filing does satisfy the concerns of the NYSE.
An interested party who wishes to contact the Company's Lead Director, Mr. Robert E. Weissman, who is also the presiding director, may use any of the following methods:
