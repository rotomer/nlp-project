EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 News release dated October 17, 2006, announcing third quarter 2006 results of operations and related financial information.

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Achieves Third-Quarter EPS up 11% on Revenue Gain of 9% Driven by Solid Performance in Servicing and Management Fees Compared to 2005 Expenses Decline 7% from Second Quarter of 2006 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 17, 2006--State Street Corporation announced today third-quarter earnings per share of $0.83, an increase of 11% from $0.75 earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2005. The third-quarter 2006 results include a cumulative gain of $15 million, or $0.03 per share, in trading services revenue related to the Corporation's tax-exempt investment programs. The comparative 2005 results included a $16 million, or $0.03 per share gain from the final settlement of the 2003 sale of the Corporation's Private Asset Management business. Revenue of $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2006 is up 9%, or $127 million, compared to $1.4 billion in the year-ago quarter. Total expenses in the third quarter of 2006 of $1.1 billion are up 8%, or $82 million, compared to $1.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter of 2006, return on shareholders' equity is 16.4%, compared to 15.9% from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2005. Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "In the third quarter, we saw seasonal declines in securities finance and trading services revenue, down from the very strong second quarter. Our continuing efforts in managing expenses resulted in a significant decline in costs, partially offsetting the decline in revenue." Logue continued, "Compared to a strong quarter a year ago, the third-quarter results demonstrated the continuing growth in our servicing and management fee revenue, increasing 10% and 27%, respectively. These results were fueled by new wins, solid cross-selling to existing customers, as well as ongoing product innovation. We achieved modest positive operating leverage compared to the year-ago quarter. For the nine months revenues were up 16% and expenses increased 12%, also resulting in significant positive operating leverage." Looking forward, Logue concluded, "Through nine months we are performing above the high end of our ranges for revenue, earnings per share, and return on equity, all on an operating basis excluding the second-quarter tax charges. We expect that we will moderately exceed the high end of the ranges we established for the full year." THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Servicing fees are up 10%, to $685 million from $620 million in last year's third quarter. The increase is attributable to new business from existing and new customers in 2006 and higher average equity market valuations. Total assets under custody are $11.3 trillion, up 15%, compared with $9.8 trillion in the year-ago quarter. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 5% from the third quarter of 2005; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 19%. The average values for the NASDAQ are down slightly, less than 1%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $238 million, up 27% from $188 million a year ago. Management fees reflect continued new business, increased performance fees, and an increase in average month-end equity valuations. Total assets under management are $1.6 trillion, up 16%, compared to $1.4 trillion the previous year. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees is $171 million for the quarter, down 3% from $176 million in an unusually strong quarter a year ago. Excluding the cumulative gain, trading services revenue would be down 11%. The decrease is driven by weaker brokerage volumes, as well as lower FX volatility. Securities finance revenue is $87 million in the quarter, up 18% compared to $74 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in volume and new business. Processing fees and other revenue are down 16%, or $12 million, at $65 million, compared to $77 million a year ago, primarily due to lower customer activity. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $275 million, an increase of $30 million, or 12% from $245 million a year ago. The increase in net interest revenue is due to a favorable mix in non-US deposits, an increase in non-U.S. rates, as well as growth in the balance sheet due to customer activity levels. Net interest margin increased to 1.22% from 1.10% a year ago. Expenses increased from $1,008 million to $1,090 million, up $82 million, or 8%. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 13% to $639 million, primarily attributable to additions to headcount, incentive compensation due to improved year-to-date performance, and increases in benefits. The increase in expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 9% to $121 million, due to higher volumes. Expenses for information systems & communications increased $4 million, or 3%, to $121 million. Occupancy expense decreased 5%, or $5 million, to $91 million. Other expenses are flat at $118 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter is 34.6% compared with 34.0% in the third quarter of last year. THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS VS. SECOND QUARTER Third-quarter net income per share of $0.83 compares to net income per share from continuing operations of $0.68 per share which includes $.25 per share for tax charges in the second quarter. Net income in the third quarter of $0.83 per share would compare to $0.93, excluding these charges. Total revenue in the third quarter of $1.5 billion is down $136 million, or 8% versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Total expenses are $1.1 billion, down 7%, or $86 million, versus $1.2 billion in the second quarter. For the third quarter of 2006, return on shareholders' equity is 16.4% compared to 19.2% in the second quarter, excluding the tax charges. Servicing fees are flat at $685 million due to slightly improved average market valuations and new business, offset by lower transaction volumes. Management fees are up 3% to $238 million principally due to performance fees, new business and slightly higher month-end equity valuations. Trading services revenue declined 34% to $171 million due to seasonal weakness in foreign exchange and brokerage. Excluding the cumulative gain, trading services revenue would have been down 40%. Securities finance revenue decreased 32%, from $128 million to $87 million, due to seasonally high volumes in the second quarter. Processing fees and other declined 12% from $74 million to $65 million due to lower customer activity. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was flat at $275 million, compared to the second quarter. All expense categories declined compared to the second quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense total $639 million, a decline of $45 million, or 7%, from $684 million, attributable primarily to reductions in incentive compensation. Transaction processing services expense decreased $13 million, or 10%, to $121 million due to reduction in volumes. Information systems and communication expense was down 6%, or $8 million, to $121 million and occupancy expense was down 4%, or $4 million, to $91 million. Other expenses are down $16 million, or 12%, from $134 million to $118 million due to continuing emphasis on cost containment. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION All per share amounts represent diluted earnings per share. The newly issued FAS 158, Employers' Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans requires that we account for differences between plan assets and projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2006, on our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter we expect to record approximately $160 million to $170 million as an after-tax reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income in order to comply with FAS 158. This range assumes relative stability of capital markets in the fourth quarter.
