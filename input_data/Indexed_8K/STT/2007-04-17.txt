EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 News release dated April 17, 2007, announcing first quarter 2007 results of operations and related financial information.

Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Achieves Record Revenue of $1.7 Billion and EPS of $.93 in the First Quarter, Both up 11% versus Year-Ago Quarter Tenth Consecutive Quarter of Positive Operating Leverage BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2007--State Street Corporation announced today first-quarter net income per share of $0.93, up 11% from earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.84 in last year's first quarter. Operating-basis revenue of $1.708 billion in the first quarter of 2007, representing a State Street record for a quarter, is up 11.3% from $1.534 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Total expenses in the first quarter of 2007 of $1.213 billion are up 10.7% from $1.096 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. As a result, State Street achieved positive operating leverage of approximately 60 basis points. Net income of $314 million for the quarter is up 11% from income from continuing operations of $282 million for the year-ago quarter. For the first quarter of 2007, return on shareholders' equity was 17.4% compared to 17.6% from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2006. Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We continue to grow our revenue and earnings per share and generate return on equity consistent with our long-term goals. Our ability to control expenses and achieve positive operating leverage contributed to this result, while revenue from investment servicing and securities finance increased significantly. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of State Street Global Advisors this quarter, which continues to generate increased revenue and profit driven largely by demand from clients for its range of innovative enhanced and quantitative active investment strategies. Our net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to benefit from a favorable mix of customer deposits, especially from non-US customers. Trading services revenue declined moderately as foreign exchange markets were not as robust as they were in last year's first quarter, which, as we stated at the time, were unusually strong. "During the first quarter, we closed the Currenex transaction and are excited about the capabilities resulting from this acquisition. We look forward to completing the proposed acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corporation, which is expected to close in the middle of the year. We expect that these transactions will enhance our leadership in several high-growth segments of the investment servicing markets and deliver important benefits for our customers." FIRST QUARTER 2007 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER Servicing fees are up 9% to $718 million from $657 million in last year's first quarter. The increase is attributable to new business from existing and new customers in 2007 and to higher daily-average equity market valuations. Total assets under custody are $12.3 trillion at March 31, 2007, up 15%, compared with $10.7 trillion at March 31, 2006. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 11% from the first quarter of 2006; daily average values for the MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 19%. Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $261 million, up 19% from $220 million in the year-ago quarter. Growth in management fees reflect continued new business, as well as an increase in average month-end equity market valuations. Total assets under management are $1.8 trillion, up 20%, compared to $1.5 trillion at March 31, 2006. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $220 million for the quarter, down 4% from $230 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in foreign exchange is due to weaker volatility, offset partially by increased volumes. Brokerage and other fees increased 5% due primarily to fees from one month of Currenex revenue, partially offset by weaker transition management and brokerage volumes. Securities finance revenue is $98 million in the quarter, up 21% from $81 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in the volume of securities lent. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $337 million, an increase of 22% from $277 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to a higher level of customer deposits, the continued benefit from the non-US rate environment, and stable U.S. rates. Expenses increased to $1.213 billion, up 10.7% from $1.096 billion a year ago. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 16% to $739 million from $635 million, primarily as a result of the impact of incentive compensation, merit increases, increased headcount due to new business wins, and higher benefit costs. The increase in total expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 8% to $129 million from $120 million a year ago, due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business. Expenses for information systems & communications decreased 5%, to $125 million from $132 million and occupancy increased 1%, to $94 million from $93 million. Other expenses were up 9%, or $10 million at $126 million from $116 million due primarily to costs to support growth initiatives. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2007 is 35.0%, up from 34.0% in the year-ago quarter. FIRST-QUARTER 2007 RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2006 First-quarter net income per share of $0.93 is up from $.91 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. Excluding the fourth-quarter tax-related adjustment of $0.05 per share, net income per share increased 8% compared to net income per share of $0.86. Total revenue in the first quarter is $1.708 billion, up 4.5% versus $1.634 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Total expenses are $1.213 billion up 3.0% versus $1.178 billion in the fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, we achieved positive operating leverage of about 150 basis points. Return on shareholders' equity of 17.4% in the first quarter compares with 16.9% or with 15.9%, excluding 100 basis points that resulted from the fourth-quarter tax-related adjustments. Servicing fees are $718 million, up 3% from $698 million due to new business as well as an increase in daily equity market valuations. Management fees are $261 million, up 3% from $253 million primarily due to new business, as well as an increase in month-end equity market valuations, partially offset by a decline in performance fees. Trading services revenue is $220 million, up 8% from $203 million due to strength in foreign exchange revenue and brokerage and other fee revenue, primarily related to one month of Currenex revenue. Securities finance revenue increased 9%, from $90 million to $98 million due primarily to increased volumes and slightly improved spreads. Processing fees and other revenue increased 20% to $73 million from $61 million primarily due to an increase in equity income from the joint ventures. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $337 million, up 3% from $328 million, due primarily to a higher level of transaction deposits and continued benefit from the non-US rate environment. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 6% to $739 million from $694 million due to the impact of incentive compensation, higher benefit costs and the impact of increased headcount due to new business wins. Transaction processing expense is up 7% from $121 million to $129 million due to increased volumes in the investment servicing business, and Information systems and communications expense increased 5% from $119 million to $125 million, due primarily to costs associated with increased global infrastructure investments, particularly in Europe. Other expenses are down 16% from $150 million to $126 million due primarily to a decline in expenses for securities processing and professional fees. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per share.
