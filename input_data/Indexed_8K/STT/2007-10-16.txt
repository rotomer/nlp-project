Exhibit 99.1 State Street Corporation Reports Third-Quarter EPS up 10% Including                Investors Financial Integration Costs.  Record Operating EPS up 39% on Revenue Gain of 48% Compared to 2006   Strong Growth from Core Servicing and Management Businesses with                     Significant Wins This Quarter   Investors Financial Consolidation Exceeds Expectations; Projected                2007 EPS Dilution Significantly Reduced    BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2007--State Street Corporationannounced today third-quarter earnings per share of $0.91, an increasefrom $0.83 earnings per share in the third quarter of 2006. Earningsper share in the third quarter of 2007 include $141 million, or $0.24per share, of merger and integration costs associated with the July 2,2007, acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp. ("InvestorsFinancial"). On an operating basis, which excludes these costs, recordearnings are $1.15 per share, up 39% from the third quarter of 2006.    Revenue of $2.240 billion in the third quarter of 2007 is up 48%,or $725 million, compared to $1.515 billion in the year-ago quarter.Total expenses in the third quarter of 2007 are $1.689 billion.Excluding merger and integration costs associated with the InvestorsFinancial acquisition, expenses are $1.548 billion, up 42%, or $458million, compared to $1.090 billion in the year-ago quarter. For thethird quarter of 2007, return on shareholders' equity is 12.6%,compared to 16.4% in the third quarter of 2006. The return onshareholders' equity reflects the increase in shareholders' equity dueto the shares issued to shareholders of Investors Financial, net ofshares repurchased in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the mergerand integration costs, return on equity is 15.8%.    Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said, "Our core revenue was strong across both investmentservicing and investment management with significant new business fromexisting and new customers globally. On a year-over-year basis,excluding $221 million in revenue during the third quarter from theacquired Investors Financial business, revenue increased $512 million,or 34%. Servicing and management fees performed particularly well, up34% (including Investors Financial) from last year's third quarter. Wewon $825 billion of assets in new business in servicing and $26billion of net new business in asset management. Net interest revenue,also including Investors Financial, is up $198 million, or 74%. Netinterest margin is 1.73%. Excluding merger and integration costsassociated with the acquisition, we achieved significant positiveoperating leverage compared both to the year-ago quarter and to thesecond quarter."    Logue continued, "Both State Street and the acquired business fromInvestors Financial performed very well during the quarter. Due to thestrong performance of Investors Financial, we now expect this year'sdilution from the acquisition to be approximately $0.06 per share,reduced by more than half from our original outlook, and modestlyaccretive in 2008. Our improved outlook is due to our success inretaining revenue, converting accounts, and reducing costs."    Commenting on the impact of recent market activity affectingfixed-income investments, Logue added, "The fixed-income markets haveexperienced unprecedented disruption in this past quarter. We believewe are well positioned with both our portfolio and our asset-backedcommercial paper conduits. While liquidity in the fixed income marketremains challenging, our concentration in high-quality assets in ourown portfolios as well as in the conduits, have limited the impact ofthis disruption on our business. We believe that we weathered thedisruption in the fixed-income market well--without significantlyaffecting State Street's results. We're disappointed in theperformance of a small number of fixed-income strategies at StateStreet Global Advisors which performed below our expectation."    Looking forward, Logue concluded, "Through nine months we areperforming near or above the top of our ranges for growth in earningsper share (10% - 15%), revenue (20% - 22%), and achievement of returnon equity (14% - 17%), all on an operating basis, which excludesmerger and integration costs in 2007 and tax adjustments in the secondquarter of 2006. We now expect to exceed the top of the ranges for theyear for all three goals, assuming markets remain relatively stable."    In reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2007,State Street has prepared information in four categories:    --  "Baseline" results are operating results excluding the        "Investors Financial contribution" and are presented on a        fully taxable-equivalent basis.    --  "Investors Financial" results are the revenue and expenses,        including financing costs and amortization of intangibles,        attributable to the Investors Financial business acquired on        July 2, 2007. Per-share amounts reflect the effect of the        acquisition on outstanding shares.    --  "Operating" results are "reported" results excluding merger        and integration costs. They are presented on a fully        taxable-equivalent basis.    --  "Reported" results are in accordance with U.S. generally        accepted accounting principles (GAAP).    State Street believes that providing financial information in thisformat in addition to financial information prepared in accordancewith GAAP, assists investors and others by providing them withfinancial trends of ongoing business activities on a comparable basis.Management believes that providing separate Investors Financialresults and baseline financial information further assists investorsand analysts in understanding the effect of that acquisition.$ in millions expect per share dataFor the three months ended                                                             September                               September 30, 2007             30, 2006- ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Baseline  Investors  Operating Reported Reported                      (a)       Financial  (c)                                (b)- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Fee Revenue              1,588        194     1,782    1,782    $1,246- ----------------------------------------------------------------------All other revenue          448         27       475      458       269- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Total revenue            2,036        221     2,257    2,240     1,515- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Total expenses           1,375        173     1,548    1,689     1,090- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Income taxes               241         19       260      193       147- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Net income                 420         29       449      358      $278- ----------------------------------------------------------------------Diluted EPS               1.20      (.05)      1.15    $0.91     $0.83- ----------------------------------------------------------------------    (a) represents State Street excluding Investors Financialcontribution and related merger and integration costs; also presentedon a fully taxable-equivalent basis.

YEAR-AGO QUARTER    Total revenue in the third quarter increased 47.9% to $2.2billion, compared to last year's third quarter and total operatingexpenses, excluding $141 million of merger and integration costs, grew42.0% to $1.5 billion over the same period. As a result, excludingmerger and integration costs, State Street generated about 580 basispoints of positive operating leverage.    Servicing fees are up 37%, to $937 million from $685 million inlast year's third quarter. The increase is attributable to businessfrom customers added from the Investors Financial acquisition,business from new and existing customers, and higher average equitymarket valuations. Total assets under custody are $15.1 trillion atSeptember 30, 2007, up 34%, compared with $11.3 trillion at September30, 2006. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 16%, forthe MSCI(R) EAFE Index(SM) are up 20%, and for the NASDAQ are up 22%during the third quarter of 2007 from the year-ago quarter.    Investment management fees, generated by State Street GlobalAdvisors, are $299 million, up 26% from $238 million in last year'sthird quarter. Management fees reflect continued new business and anincrease in average month-end equity valuations, partially offset bylower performance fees. Total assets under management are $2.0trillion at September 30, 2007, up 22%, compared to $1.6 trillion atSeptember 30, 2006.    Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange tradingrevenue and brokerage and other fees is $320 million for the quarter,up 87% from $171 million a year ago. The increase is driven byimproved volumes and higher FX volatility. Higher brokerage and otherfee revenue is due to the impact of the Currenex acquisition,increased transition management, and strong trading volumes.    Securities finance revenue is $165 million in the quarter, up 90%compared to $87 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting animprovement in spreads and an increase in volume due to disruption inthe fixed income markets.    Processing fees and other revenue are down 6%, or $4 million, at$61 million, compared to $65 million a year ago, due to a reduction inthe fee income from the asset- backed commercial paper programprimarily due to disruption in the fixed-income markets as well as theconsolidation of tax-exempt investments onto the balance sheet at theend of the third quarter of 2006, partially offset by revenue from theInvestors Financial acquisition.    Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $481million, an increase of $206 million, or 75% from $275 million a yearago. The increase in net interest revenue is due to a favorable mix ofnon-US deposits, the impact of the Investors Financial acquisition,and the improved yields from reinvested assets. Net interest marginincreased to 1.73% from 1.22% a year ago.    Total expenses in the third quarter are $1.7 billion. Excludingmerger and integration costs, total expenses in the third quarter of2007 increased from $1.090 billion to $1.548 billion, up $458 million,or 42.0%, from the year-ago quarter primarily due to the inclusion ofInvestors Financial's operating expenses as a result of theacquisition. Baseline expenses increased 26%, while the remainder ofthe increase was due to the acquired Investors Financial business.Salaries and benefits expenses are up 43% to $916 million, primarilyattributable to additions to headcount resulting from the InvestorsFinancial acquisition, incentive compensation due to improvedyear-to-date performance, and increases in benefits. The increase inexpenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 36%to $165 million, due to higher volumes. Expenses for informationsystems and communications increased $24 million, or 20%, to $145million. Occupancy expense increased 20%, or $18 million, to $109million due to costs associated with the acquired Investors Financialbusiness. Other expenses are up 81% at $213 million due primarily tocosts associated with the acquired Investors Financial business, aswell as increased securities processing costs.    The effective tax rate for the quarter is 35.0% compared with34.6% in the third quarter of last year.    RESULTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007 VS.
