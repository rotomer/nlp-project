Average shares for the full year 2007 are 365 million shares.
 
underperformance of certain active fixed-income strategies at State Street Global Advisors (SSgA)
Results presented on an operating basis for the fourth quarter of 2007 exclude a previously announced after-tax charge of $279 million ($467 million on a pre-tax operating basis) associated with the
and $57 million, or $38 million of after-tax merger and integration costs related to the July 2, 2007, acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp. (Investors Financial).  Results presented on an operating basis for the fourth quarter of 2006 exclude an $18 million adjustment to reduce income tax expense.
 
Revenue for both quarters is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.   Full-year 2007 results presented on an operating basis exclude the $279 million after tax charge associated with State Street Global Advisors and $198 million, or $129 million of after-tax merger and integration costs relating to the acquisition of Investors Financial.  Full-year 2006 results presented on an operating basis exclude a $65 million adjustment to increase income tax expense.  Revenue for both years is presented on a fully tax-equivalent basis.
 
 
Management presents results on an operating basis in order to provide financial information that is comparable from period to period, and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our ongoing business operations.   Management believes such presentation facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of our underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
The following financial information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings per share in the fourth quarter are $1.38 per share on net income of $540 million, up 60% from $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Revenue of $2.496 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 is up 52.8% from $1.634 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago.  Expenses of $1.649 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 are up 40.0% from $1.178 billion in the year-ago quarter.  For the fourth quarter of 2007, return on shareholders equity is 18.7%, compared to 15.9% for the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
The following financial information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings for the full-year 2007 is $4.57 per share on net income of $1.669 billion, up 32% from $3.46 per share on income from continuing operations of $1.161 billion in 2006.  Revenue in 2007 is up 32.1% to a record level of $8.394 billion from $6.356 billion in 2006.   Expenses in 2007 of $5.768 billion increased 27.0% from $4.540 billion in 2006.  Return on shareholders equity in 2007 is 17.7%, up from 17.1% in 2006.
 
Commenting on the performance, Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Nearly every revenue item on our income statement increased in double digits this year, compared to 2006, resulting in 32% growth in earnings per share on an operating basis. While investment servicing and investment management fees were both strong, revenue from trading services and securities finance benefited from continuing market volatility, particularly in the fixed-income markets in the second half of 2007. The consolidation of Investors Financial continues on schedule, and the impact on our bottom line in 2007 was dilution of $.06 per share, a significant improvement from our original model of $0.14 per share dilutive. Our strategy of more actively managing the balance sheet and the growth of our non-US business contributed to an annual increase of 55% in fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue. Net interest margin equaled 1.71% for 2007. Additionally, our non-U.S. revenue now represents approximately 41% of total revenue, up from 39% in 2006.
 
Logue added, As we explained on our call earlier this month, we expect that by establishing the fourth-quarter reserve to address the legal exposure and other costs associated with the underperformance of certain active fixed-income strategies at State Street Global Advisors, we can address customer concerns and help to put the issue behind us, particularly given the current momentum in our business.  Management fee revenue at SSgA grew 21% in 2007 compared to 2006, and SSgA continues to be a strong contributor to State Streets results.  Total assets under management as of December 31, 2007, grew 13% from the level at the end of 2006, and specifically SSgAs fixed income assets increased 21% in the same period.
 
 
Logue concluded, During 2008 we will build on the progress we made in 2007, particularly outside the U.S.  We continue to target positive operating leverage on an annual basis.  For 2008, due to the acquisition of Investors Financial on July 2, 2007, our goal for growth in revenue is 14% to 17%, up from our long-term goal of 8% to 12%.  We expect earnings per share growth of 10% to 15% and return on equity of 14% to 17%, both on an operating basis.  Our 2008 target is to achieve near the lower end of these ranges.
 
In reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2007, State Street has prepared information in four categories:
 
 
 
 
 
Management believes that providing separate Investors Financial results and baseline financial information further assists investors and analysts in understanding the effect of that acquisition.
 
 
(a)
 
represents State Street
 
results on an operating basis, further adjusted to exclude the 
Investors Financial result
s described in the adjoining column, all presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis.
(b)
 
represents
revenue and expenses, including financing costs and amortization of intangibles, attributable to the Investors Financial business acquired on July 2, 2007, but excluding merger and integration costs. Presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Per-share amounts reflect the impact on outstanding shares from the issuance of approximately 61 million shares for the acquisition.
(c)
 
excludes the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 and merger and integration costs, and presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
 
 
 
FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER
 
Total revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $2.496 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 is up from $1.634 billion, or 52.8%, from the fourth quarter of 2006. Expenses on an operating basis are $1.649 billion, up 40.0% compared with $1.178 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. As a result, on an operating basis, State Street generated about 1280 basis points of positive operating leverage.
 
Servicing fees are $967 million, up $269 million or 39%, from $698 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is attributable to business from customers added from the Investors Financial acquisition, business from new and existing clients and higher average equity valuations. Total assets under custody at quarter end are $15.30 trillion, a record level, up 29%, compared with $11.85 trillion at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 8%, for the MSCI EAFE Index are up 16%, and for the NASDAQ are up 13% during the fourth quarter of 2007 from the year-ago quarter.
sm
 
Management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $297 million, up $44 million, or 17%, compared to $253 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in management fees reflects new business from existing and new clients and an increase in average month-end equity valuations, offset partially by lower performance fees. Total assets under management at quarter end are $1.98 trillion, up 13%, compared to $1.75 trillion at the end of the year-ago quarter.
 
Average month-end values compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, are up 7% for the S&P 500 Index and up 13% for the NASDAQ; average month-end values for the MSCI EAFE Index are up 15%.  The total return of the Lehman US Aggregate bond index for the fourth quarter is 3.00%.
sm
 
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fee revenue, is up 73%, from $203 million to $352 million. The increase is driven by improved volumes and higher volatility in foreign exchange, as well as an increase in brokerage and other revenue principally due to the acquisition of Currenex in March, 2007.
 
Securities finance revenue is $256 million in the quarter, compared to $90 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 184%.  The increase primarily reflects improved spreads and increased demand for securities on loan as a result of turmoil in the fixed-income markets.
 
 
Processing and other revenue is down 38%, or $23 million to $38 million primarily due to increased costs of funding for our asset-backed commercial paper.
 
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue is $573 million, up 75% from $328 million in last years fourth quarter.  The increase is due to reinvestment of assets at higher rates and lower-cost funding, the impact of the Investors Financial acquisition, and favorable spreads and increased volumes of non-US deposits.
 
The increase in expenses on an operating basis to $1.649 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $1.178 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006 is primarily due to the inclusion of Investors Financials operating expenses for the second half of 2007.  Baseline expenses increased 26%.
 
Salaries and employee benefits expense on an operating basis increased $240 million to $934 million, attributable to additions to headcount from the Investors Financial acquisition.  Transaction processing expense increased 52% to $184 million principally due to the acquisition.  Also primarily as a result of the acquisition, information systems and communications expense increased 24% to $148 million, and occupancy expenses of $107 million in 2007 quarter compare to $94 million in the 2006 quarter.  On an operating basis, other expenses increased 84%, or $126 million, to $276 million, primarily due to acquisition costs, fees, such as for professional services and recruiting, and securities processing costs.
 
The effective tax rate was 27.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2006.  We expect the rate for 2008 to be 34.5%.
 
 
FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS VS. THIRD QUARTER
 
On an operating basis, fourth-quarter earnings are $1.38 per share as compared to third-quarter earnings of $1.15 per share, which excluded $91 million, or $0.24 per share of after-tax merger and integration costs. On an operating basis in both periods, earnings per share would have increased 20%. Total revenue on a fully tax-equivalent basis in the 2007 fourth quarter of $2.496 billion is up 10.6%, or $239 million compared to $2.257 billion in the third quarter. On an operating basis, expenses in the fourth quarter of 2007 are $1.649 billion up 6.5%, or $101 million, from third quarter expenses of $1.548 billion.
 
Servicing fee revenue is up 3% due to business from new and existing customers and higher average equity valuations. Management fees are down 1% due to lower performance fees, offset partially by new business wins and higher equity valuations. Trading services revenue is up 10% to $352 million primarily due to higher volatility and increased volumes and higher volatility in FX. Securities finance revenue improved 55% to $256 million due to improved spreads.   Processing fees and other revenue declined 38% to $38 million due to lower results from the structured products business and lower earnings from joint-venture equity investments.  Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue increased 19% to $573 million due to reinvestment of assets at higher rates and a higher level of lower-cost funding and the impact of the Investors Financial acquisition.
