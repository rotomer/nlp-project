EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
State Street Corporation Achieves Record Revenue of $2.6 Billion in the First Quarter, up 52% from Year-Ago Quarter
EPS of $1.35 up 45%, Including $0.04 in Merger and Integration Costs
Strong Financial Performance Continues in Challenging Environment
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--State Street Corporation announced today first-quarter earnings per share of $1.35, up 45% from earnings per share of $0.93 in last years first quarter. Earnings per share in the first quarter of 2008 includes $17 million of after-tax merger and integration costs associated with the July 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp. (Investors Financial), or $0.04 per share. Excluding these costs, operating earnings per share of $1.39 would have been up 49% compared to $.93 in the first quarter of 2007. Revenue of $2.577 billion in the first quarter of 2008, representing a State Street record for a quarter, is up 52% from $1.696 billion compared to the year-ago quarter and includes $220 million in revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business. Total expenses in the first quarter of 2008 of $1.774 billion are up 46.2% from $1.213 billion compared to the year-ago quarter and excluding the merger and integration costs would be $1.748 billion, up 44.1%. Excluding the results of Investors Financial and the merger and integration costs, revenue would be up 39% and expenses would be up 31.1%. On an operating basis, excluding the merger and integration costs, State Street achieved positive operating leverage of approximately 810 basis points. For the first quarter of 2008, return on shareholders equity was 18.7% and was 19.4%, excluding the merger and integration costs, up from 17.4% in the first quarter of 2007.
Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "I am extremely pleased with this record revenue performance, particularly in todays challenging environment. The momentum we have achieved over the past 12 months continues, despite the negative equity markets. The neutral earnings-per-share result for the acquired Investors Financial business demonstrates our success in consolidating this business. In the first quarter, we grew our revenue and operating earnings per share and generated operating return on equity above our financial goals. Compared to the year-ago quarter, we experienced growth in nearly all lines of our income statement and recorded positive operating leverage for the fourteenth consecutive quarter when measured on a year-over-year basis.
Servicing fee revenue was up 34% and asset management fee revenue grew 7% from the prior years first quarter. We won $600 billion of assets in new business in servicing and $69 billion of net new business in asset management. Growth outside the U.S. continues to provide momentum. Growth in revenue was particularly strong in our trading business and our securities finance business in this volatile business environment. Growth in net interest revenue is due to a favorable U.S. rate environment as well as the successful execution of our balance sheet strategy.
Logue continued, During the first quarter, we strengthened our regulatory capital position with strong net income of more than $500 million and the issuance of $500 million of tier-1 qualified regulatory capital.
Logue concluded, Given the continued unsettled economic environment, for now we continue to expect to achieve in the middle of the ranges we established for this year. Excluding the impact of the fourth-quarter 2007 charge and the impact of merger and integration costs in both 2007 and 2008, these ranges reflect an increase in operating earnings per share of between 10 and 15 percent; an increase in revenue of 14 to 17 percent; and operating return on equity of 14 to 17 percent.
In reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2008, State Street has prepared information in four categories:
Baseline results are results on an operating basis excluding the Investors Financial results described below and are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Investors Financial results are the revenue and expenses, including financing costs and amortization of intangibles, attributable to the Investors Financial business acquired on July 2, 2007, but excluding merger and integration costs, all presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Per-share amounts reflect the effect of the acquisition on outstanding shares.
Operating-basis results are reported results excluding the merger and integration costs. They are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Reported results are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Management believes that providing separate Investors Financial results and baseline financial information further assists investors and analysts in understanding the effect of that acquisition. Management presents results on an operating basis in order to provide financial information that is comparable from period to period and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our ongoing business operations. Management believes such presentation facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of our underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
FIRST QUARTER 2008 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO QUARTER
Servicing fees are up 34% to $960 million from $718 million in last years first quarter. The increase is attributable to business from Investors Financial as well as new business from existing and new customers in 2008.Total assets under custody are $14.900 trillion at March 31, 2008, up 21%, compared with $12.331 trillion at March 31, 2007. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are down5% from the first quarter of 2007; daily average values for the MSCI EAFE Index are down 3%.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $278 million, up 7% from $261 million in the year-ago quarter. Growth in management fees reflects continued net new business, offset partially by a decrease in performance fees and in average month-end equity market valuations. Total assets under management at March 31, 2008, are $1.955 trillion, up 6%, compared to $1.849 trillion at March 31, 2007.
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $366 million for the quarter, up 66% from $220 million in the year-ago quarter. 74% increase in foreign exchange revenue is due to higher volatility and increased volumes. Brokerage and other fees increased 49% due primarily to fees from the acquired Currenex business, as well as strength in transition management.
The
Securities finance revenue is $303 million in the quarter, up 209% from $98 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting improved spreadsThis unusually strong growth reflects the recent actions by the Federal Reserve in reducing interest rates.
.
Processing fees and other is $54 million, down 26% from $73 million in the first quarter of 2007 due primarily to lower revenue from structured products.
Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $648 million, an increase of 92% from $337 million a year ago. The increase is due primarily to the benefit of recent cuts in U.S. rates, the benefit of the revenue from the acquired Investors Financial business, and increased volumes in transaction deposits from non-US customers.
Expenses increased to $1.774 billion, up 46.2% from $1.213 billion a year ago, partially due to the acquisition of Investors Financial. Excluding $158 million in operating costs associated with Investors Financial and $26 million in merger and integration costs, expenses are up 31.1% to $1.590 billion. Salaries and benefits expenses are up 44% to $1.062 billion from $739 million, primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation due to improved performance and the accounting impact of stock-related compensation for retirement-eligible employees, the impact of the Investors Financial acquisition, and increased headcount due to new business wins.
The increase in total expenses also includes higher transaction processing services, up 26% to $162 million from $129 million a year ago, due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business primarily as a result of the acquisition of Investors Financial. Expenses for information systems & communications increased 24%, to $155 million from $125 million andoccupancy increased 17%, to $110 million from $94 million, with both increases due primarily to the acquisition of Investors Financial. Other expenses were up 106%, or $133 million at $259 million from $126 million due primarily to increased professional fees and securities processing costs, as well as Investors Financials costs associated with amortization of intangibles.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2008 is 34.0%, down from 35.0% in the year-ago quarter.
FIRST-QUARTER 2008 RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2007
First-quarter earnings per share of $1.35 is up from $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the non-operating costs of $38 million of after-tax merger and integration costs in the fourth quarter and $17 million in the first quarter and an after-tax charge of $279 million related to certain active fixed-income strategies at State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) in the fourth quarter of 2007, operating earnings per share of $1.39 is up slightly from operating earnings per share of $1.38 in the fourth quarter of 2007. Total revenue in the first quarter is $2.577 billion, up 4.0% versus $2.479 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Total expenses for the first quarter of 2008 are $1.774 billion versus $2.173 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the fourth-quarter charge and the merger and integration expenses, total expenses are $1.748 billion up 6.0% versus $1.649 billion in the fourth quarter. Return on shareholders equity of 18.7% in the first quarter compares with 7.7% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the non-operating charges, operating return on equity would have been 19.4% in the first quarter of 2008 up from 18.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Servicing fees are $960 million, down slightly from $967 million in the fourth quarter due to a decline in daily equity valuations, partially offset by business from new and existing customers. Management fees are $278 million, down 6% from $297 million primarily due to a 10% decline in month-end equity valuations and lower performance fees. Trading services revenue is $366 million, up 4% from $352 million primarily due to increased volatility in foreign exchange markets. Securities finance revenue is $303 million, up 18% from the prior quarter due to increased spreads reflecting the recent actions by the Federal Reserve in reducing interest rates, offset partially by lower volumes due to a decline in market values. Processing fees and other revenue decreased slightly to $54 million from $55 million. Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $648 million, up 13% from $573 million, due primarily to the impact of the recent rate cuts in the U.S., partially offset by a slight change in customer mix.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 14% to $1.062 billion from $934 million due to the impact of incentive compensation as a result of the accounting impact of stock-related compensation for retirement-eligible employees and improved performance, and higher benefit costs. Transaction processing expense is down 12% from $184 million to $162 million due primarily to receipt of a depository rebate, and Information systems and communications expense increased 5% from $148 million to $155 million, due primarily to costs associated with increased global infrastructureinvestments Other expenses are down 6% from $276 million to $259 million due primarily to a decline in expenses related to Investors Financial, as well as lower securities processing costs.
