On October 13, 2008, State Street Corporation entered into a Major Financial Institution Participation Commitment in connection with actions taken by the U.S. government designed to protect the U.S. economy, strengthen public confidence in our financial institutions and foster the robust functioning of our credit markets. Under the Commitment, State Street agreed to:
 
 
 
 
In connection with its participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program, State Street will issue to the Treasury for cash consideration of $2 billion (1) two million senior preferred shares, $1,000 liquidation preference per share, and (2) warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to $300 million. For these purposes, the market price of State Street's common stock will be determined based upon a 20-trading day trailing average at the time of issuance.
The senior preferred shares will qualify as Tier 1 capital and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, and 9% per annum thereafter. The senior preferred shares will be non-voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could adversely affect the shares. The senior preferred shares may be redeemed by State Street at par after three years. Prior to the end of three years, the senior preferred shares may only be redeemed by State Street with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock for cash. Until the third anniversary of the issuance, or such earlier time as the senior preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred by the Treasury, State Street will not, without the Treasury's consent, be able to increase its dividend rate per share of common stock or repurchase its common stock. The warrants will be immediately exercisable, have a 10-year term and have an exercise price, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, equal to the market price of State Street's common stock at the time of issuance, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The Treasury will agree not to exercise voting power with respect to any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants. If State Street receives aggregate gross cash proceeds of not less than $2 billion from one or more qualifying equity offerings of Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock on or prior to December 31, 2009, the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants then held by the Treasury will be reduced by one half of the original number of shares, taking into account all adjustments, underlying the warrants.
 
State Street will issue the senior preferred shares and the warrants in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and will file a shelf registration statement covering the senior preferred shares, the warrants and the common stock underlying the warrants as promptly as practical after the issuance. The Treasury will also receive piggyback registration rights with respect to the senior preferred shares, the warrants and the common stock underlying the warrants. Neither the senior preferred shares nor the warrants will be subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer, except that the Treasury may only transfer or exercise an aggregate of one-half of the warrants prior to the earlier of the redemption of 100% of the senior preferred shares and December 31, 2009.
As a condition to closing the issuance of the senior preferred shares and warrants, State Street will modify or terminate all benefit plans, arrangements and agreements, including golden parachute agreements, to the extent necessary to be in compliance with, and following the closing and for so long as the Treasury holds any State Street securities, State Street will agree to be bound by, the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of Section 111 of the Emergency Economic Stability Act of 2008 and any applicable guidance or regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury on or prior to the date of the issuance. The applicable executive compensation requirements will apply to the compensation of State Street's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and three other most highly compensated executive officers.
A summary of the terms of the senior preferred shares and warrants is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The description in this Item 1.01 of the terms of the issuance of senior preferred shares and warrants is qualified in its entirety by reference to the summary of terms filed as Exhibit 10.1.

The information concerning executive compensation set forth under "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. State Street's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is Ronald E. Logue and its Executive Vice
 
President and Chief Financial Officer is Edward J. Resch. State Street has not yet determined the compensation for its executive officers for 2008.

Antonellis, Vice Chairman, and James S. Phalen, Executive Vice President.
 
Separately, on October 16, 2008, State Street Corporation's Board of Directors amended and restated the company's by-laws. Article I, Section 7 (relating to notice of shareholder business and nomination of directors) was amended to: (a) expand the information that must be provided in a shareholders notice of proposed business or a nomination to include, among other things, information about derivatives, hedged positions and other economic and voting interests, information about any agreements the proponent may have with others in connection with the proposed business or nomination, and the exact text of any proposal; and (b) clarify the scope of the advance notice provisions and the authority of the chairman of the meeting in determining whether business or nominations have been brought in accordance with the by-law requirements. Article I, Section 2 (relating to special meetings of stockholders) was amended to require shareholders calling a special meeting to provide similar information to that required by the advance notice by-law.
A copy of the amended and restated by-laws is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The copy is marked to show changes from the prior by-laws. The description in this Item 5.03 of the amendments to the by-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated by-laws filed as Exhibit 3.1.

Date: October 17, 2008
 

Exhibit 3.1
SECTION 1. The annual meeting of shareholders of this corporation shall be held at such time and place as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. In the event an annual meeting is not held at the time fixed in accordance with these by-laws or the time for an annual meeting is not fixed in accordance with these by-laws to be held within 13 months after the last annual meeting, the corporation may designate a special meeting as a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting, and such meeting shall have all of the effect of an annual meeting. The purposes for which an annual meeting is to be held shall be specified in the corporation's notice of the meeting and only business within such purposes may be conducted at the meeting.
Annual Meeting.
SECTION 2. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the chairman of the Board or by the Board of Directors and shall be called by the secretary, or in the case of the death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the secretary, by any other officer, if the holders of at least forty (40) percent of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue to be considered at the proposed special meeting sign, date and deliver to the secretary one or more written demands for the meeting describing the purpose for which it is to be held. Such demands may suggest a place, date and hour of such meeting, provided, however, that no such demands shall suggest a date not a full business day or an hour not within normal business hours as the date or hour of such meeting and provided, further, that such date and hour shall be determined by the chairman of the Board or by the Board of Directors. Special meetings of the shareholders shall be held at such place as may be determined by the Board of Directors. The purposes for which a special meeting is to be held shall be described in the corporation's notice of the meeting and only business within such purposes may be conducted at the meeting.
Special Meetings.
,
Such demands must include all the information that would be required pursuant to paragraph (b) of Section 7 of this Article I.
SECTION 3. Meetings of the shareholders may be held within or without the Commonwealth.
Place of Meetings.
SECTION 4. Except as hereinafter provided, a written notice of each meeting of shareholders stating the place, date and hour and describing the purpose or purposes thereof shall be given by the secretary or an assistant secretary (or by any other
Notice.
officer who is authorized to provide notice of such meeting) no fewer than seven nor more than 60 days before the meeting date to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat and to each other shareholder to whom, by law or by the articles of organization, the corporation is required to provide such notice. Such notice shall be given in accordance with Article V of these by-laws. Whenever notice of a meeting is required to be given to a shareholder by law, by the articles of organization or by these by-laws, a written waiver of such notice, signed before or after the meeting by such shareholder or such shareholder's attorney thereunto authorized, or transmitted by such shareholder or attorney by a method from which it can be determined that the waiver was authorized by the shareholder or attorney, and delivered to the corporation for inclusion with the records of the meeting, shall be deemed equivalent to such notice for such meeting and all adjourned sessions thereof. In addition, a shareholder's attendance at a meeting: (i) waives objection to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (ii) waives objection to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.
SECTION 5. . Except as otherwise provided by the articles of organization, at any meeting of the shareholders a majority of all shares of stock then issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. Though less than a quorum be present, any meeting may without further notice be adjourned to a subsequent date or until a quorum be had, and at any such adjourned meeting any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Action at a Meeting
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock present or represented and entitled to vote shall be necessary and sufficient to the determination of any questions brought before the meeting, unless a larger or different vote is required by law, by the articles of organization or by these by-laws, provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided by the articles of organization, any election by shareholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote in such election.
Except as otherwise provided by law or by the articles of organization, each outstanding share entitled to vote on any matter shall have one vote for each such share held of record according to the records of the corporation, and a proportionate vote for any fractional share so held, on each matter voted on at a shareholder meeting. To the extent permitted by law, shareholders may vote either in person or by proxy. The delivery of a proxy on behalf of a shareholder consistent with telephonic or electronically transmitted instructions obtained pursuant to procedures of the corporation reasonably designed to verify that such instructions have been authorized by such shareholder shall constitute execution and delivery of the proxy by or on behalf of the shareholder. Except to the extent permitted by law, no proxy dated more than eleven months before the meeting named therein shall be valid, and unless otherwise expressly limited by its terms, a proxy shall entitle the holder or holders of the proxy to vote at any adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final adjournment of such meeting. A proxy with respect to stock held in the name of two or more persons shall be valid if authorized by or on behalf of any one of them unless at or prior to the exercise of the proxy the corporation receives written (including by electronic transmission as provided above in this paragraph) notice to the contrary from any one of them. A proxy purporting to be authorized by or on behalf of
 
a shareholder, if accepted by the corporation in its discretion, shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise, and the burden of proving its invalidity shall rest on the challenger.
Any election of directors by shareholders and the determination of any other action to come before a meeting of shareholders shall be by ballot if so requested by any shareholder at the meeting entitled to vote thereon but need not be otherwise.
SECTION 6. Except as otherwise required by law, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting if all shareholders entitled to vote on the action consent to the action in writing (including by means of electronic transmission describing the action taken, from which it can be determined that the consent was authorized by the shareholder), which written consents describe the action taken, are signed by all shareholders entitled to vote on the action, bear the date of the signatures of such shareholders and are delivered to the corporation for inclusion with the records of the meetings of shareholders within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation. Each consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote at a meeting.
Action Without a Meeting.
SECTION 7. .

Action taken under this Section 8 is effective when the last director signs or delivers the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date. A consent signed or delivered under this Section 8 has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.
Action Without a Meeting.
SECTION 9. . The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors, who shall have and may exercise (or have exercised under its authority) all the powers of the corporation, except such as by law or by the articles of organization are conferred upon or reserved to the shareholders. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the directors may at any time authorize to be issued all or any part of the unissued capital stock of the corporation from time to time authorized under the articles of organization and may determine, subject to any requirements of applicable law, the consideration for which stock is to be issued and the manner of allocating such consideration between capital and surplus. In the event of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining directors then in office, except as otherwise provided by law, shall have and may exercise all of the powers of the Board of Directors until the vacancy is filled.
