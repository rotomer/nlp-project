Slide: 2 Reminder This presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements about State Streets goals and expectations regarding its business, financial condition, results of operations and strategies, the financial and market outlook, governmental and regulatory initiatives and developments and the business environment. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing State Street's expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this presentation. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include: global financial market disruptions and the current, worldwide economic recession, and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address such disruptions and recession in the United States and internationally; the financial strength of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and with which we have investment or financial exposure; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities, and the liquidity requirements of our customers; the credit quality and credit agency ratings of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss; the maintenance of credit agency ratings for our debt obligations as well as the level of credibility of credit agency ratings; the possibility that changes to accounting rules or in market conditions or asset performance may require any off-balance sheet activities, including the unconsolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administer, to be consolidated into our financial statements, requiring the recognition of associated losses; the possibility of our customers incurring substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent, and the possibility of further general reductions in the valuation of assets; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost short-term funding; potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to the effects of consolidation, extensive and changing government regulation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty;  the level and volatility of interest rates and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the United States and internationally; our ability to measure the fair value of securities in our investment securities portfolio and in the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we sponsor; the results of litigation and similar disputes and, in particular, the effect of current or potential litigation concerning SSgA's active fixed-income strategies, and the enactment of legislation and changes in regulation and enforcement that impact us and our customers, as well as the effects of legal and regulatory proceedings; adverse publicity or other reputational harm; our ability to pursue acquisitions, strategic alliances and divestures, finance future business acquisitions and obtain regulatory approvals and consents for acquisitions; the performance and demand for the products and services we offer, including the level and timing of withdrawals from our collective investment products; our ability to continue to grow revenue, attract highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements; our ability to control operating risks, information technology systems risks and outsourcing risks, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will fail or be circumvented; the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk, and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to obtain quality and timely services from third parties with which we contract; changes in accounting standards and practices, including changes in the interpretation of existing standards, that impact our consolidated financial statements; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that impact the amount of taxes due.  Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in State Street's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent SEC filings, including, in particular, its Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 20, 2009. State Street encourages investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on Risk Factors, and its subsequent SEC filings for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision.
