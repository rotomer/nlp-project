Exhibit 99.1
State Street Corporation Reports First-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $1.02 on Total Revenue of $2.0 Billion;
Ongoing Expense Controls Drive Positive Operating Leverage;
Progress Made On TCE Improvement Plan
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 21, 2009--State Street Corporation today announced first-quarter earnings per common share of $1.02, a decline from earnings per share of $1.35 in last years first quarter. Revenue of $2.002 billion in the first quarter of 2009 is down 22.3% from $2.577 billion in the year-ago first quarter. Total expenses in the first quarter of 2009 of $1.304 billion are down 26.5% from $1.774 billion compared to the year-ago first quarter. For the first quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 15.7%, down from 18.7% in the first quarter of 2008.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release.
Operating-basis results in the first quarter of 2009 exclude $(17) million in merger and integration costs associated with the 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp. (Investors Financial), partly offset by net interest revenue of $7 million related to State Streets participation in the Federal Reserve Banks Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF). Operating-basis results for the first quarter of 2008 excluded merger and integration costs of $(26) million associated with the Investors Financial acquisition. Operating-basis results for the fourth quarter of 2008 exclude the net effects of pre-tax adjustments of $(723) million, or $(1.04) per common share, including $(450) million related to a transaction with certain stable value funds managed by State Street Global Advisors; restructuring charges of $(306) million, primarily associated with our reduction in force; and merger and integration costs of $(27) million associated with the Investors Financial acquisition; partially offset by net interest revenue of $60 million related to the AMLF. Operating-basis revenue for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Operating-basis earnings per common share in the first quarter of 2009 are $1.04, down 25.2% from $1.39 per share in the first quarter of 2008. Operating-basis revenue of $2.027 billion in the first quarter of 2009 is down 22.0% from $2.600 billion in the first quarter a year ago. Operating-basis expenses of $1.287 billion in the first quarter of 2009 are down 26.4% from $1.748 billion in the year-ago quarter. These first quarter 2009 revenue and expense results represent 440 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the first quarter of 2008. For the first quarter of 2009, operating-basis return on common shareholders equity is 15.9%, down from 19.4% for the first quarter of 2008.
The balance sheet is $142 billion at March 31, 2009, compared to $174 billion at December 31, 2008. Excluding $30 billion in excess deposits held at central banks at March 31, 2009, compared with $52 billion at December 31, 2008, and $740 million of investment securities related to the AMLF, compared to $6 billion at December 31, 2008, the normalized balance sheet was $111 billion at March 31, 2009, compared to a normalized balance sheet of $116 billion at December 31, 2008. At March 31, 2008, the balance sheet was $154 billion. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of March 31, 2009, with our tier-1 capital ratio at 19.13% and our tier-1 leverage ratio at 10.44%.
Reflecting the ongoing illiquidity in the financial markets, at March 31, 2009, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio are $5.9 billion, down from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2008, and in the State Street-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits are $3.6 billion, flat with December 31, 2008. Since March 31, 2009, the unrealized after-tax losses in the investment portfolio have improved $91 million to $5.8 billion as of Friday, April 17, 2009.
Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "In one of the toughest operating environments in decades, the strength in new business from prior quarters benefited our results. This momentum combined with expense controls, comparing the first quarter of 2009 with the first quarter of 2008, enabled us to achieve 440 basis points of operating leverage, demonstrating our ability to reduce expenses in line with market-driven reductions in revenue. While our servicing fee and management fee revenue declined 20% and 35% respectively from the year-ago quarter, both compared with the more than 40% decline in the equity markets for the same periods. In servicing this quarter we won $111 billion in assets, demonstrating continued strength in our core business and increased demand for servicing driven by the stressed markets and heightened product complexity. At State Street Global Advisors, we are seeing a continuing move to passive strategies and ETF strategies, as the $37 billion in net new business in the first quarter demonstrates. We expect our continuing investment in solutions and products for our customers to put us in a strong position when markets return to a more normalized state.
Regarding capital, Logue commented, Our regulatory capital ratios remain high, and we are making progress on our TCE improvement plan. Our tangible common equity ratio at March 31, 2009, stands at 5.87% and our TCE ratio, assuming consolidation of the asset-backed commercial paper conduits we administer, has improved 103 basis points from 1.19% at December 31, 2008, to 2.22% when calculated as a percentage of total assets. Our TCE ratio calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets is 8.15% at March 31, 2009, an increase from 7.29% at December 31, 2008 and on a basis is 3.34% as of March 31, 2009, up from 2.18% at December 31. 2008. Assuming prospective stability or improvement in fixed-income markets and operating results consistent with expectations, we expect to achieve an estimated TCE ratio calculated as a percentage of total assets of about 4.57% by year-end 2009, approximately in line with our long-range target for TCE of 4.25% to 4.75%. We expect the TCE ratio calculated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets to be about 6.57% by December 31, 2009. Our unrealized losses improved at the end of the first quarter, compared with December 31, and this improvement continues through April 17.

Logue concluded, We have taken steps to align our expenses to a weaker market environment, so we believe were well positioned for an economic recovery. Given the continued unsettled economic environment and more weakness in the first quarter than we expected, we now believe that in 2009 we will achieve nearer the weaker end of the ranges we established at our Investor and Analyst Forum in February: operating revenue to decline between 8% and 12%; operating earnings per share to decline between 12% and 16%; and operating return on equity to be between 14% and 17%.
FIRST QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO FIRST QUARTER
Servicing fees are only down 20% to $766 million from $960 million in last years first quarter. The decrease is attributable primarily to a more than 40% decline in daily average asset valuations. Total assets under custody are $11.337 trillion at March 31, 2009, down 24%, compared with $14.900 trillion at March 31, 2008. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are down40% from the first quarter of 2008; daily average values for the MSCI EAFE Index are down 47%.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $181 million, down 35% from $278 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in management fees primarily reflects the greater than 40% decrease in average month-end equity valuations and lower performance fees. Total assets under management at March 31, 2009, are $1.395 trillion, down 29%, compared to $1.955 trillion at March 31, 2008.
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $245 million for the first quarter of 2009, down 33% from $366 million in a very strong first quarter a year-ago. The 28% decrease in foreign exchange revenue is due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher volatility. Brokerage and other fees decreased 47% due primarily to the impact of lower market valuations on several securities held in the trading account.
Securities finance revenue is $181 million in the quarter, down 40% from $303 million in the year-ago first quarter. This significant decline is due primarily to lower volumes, offset very modestly by a slight improvement in spreads.
Processing fees and other is $49 million, down 9% from $54 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $589 million, a decrease of 9% from $648 million the year-ago first quarter. The decline is due primarily to the decrease in customer deposit volumes and spreads, partially offset by a decline in interest rates worldwide.
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $84 million during the first quarter due to deteriorating economic conditions, in order to provide for expected losses related to the commercial mortgage loans held on our balance sheet that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Operating-basis expenses decreased to $1.287 billion, down 26% from $1.748 billion a year ago, due primarily to a 31% reduction in salaries and benefits expense, as well as measures to reduce other expenses by 45%.
The decrease in total expenses also includes lower transaction processing services, down 19% to $131 million from $162 million a year ago, due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business. Expenses for information systems & communications increased to $161 million from $155 million andoccupancy increased 10% to $121 million from $110 million. Other expenses were down 45%, or $116 million to $143 million from $259 million due primarily to lower professional fees and lower securities processing costs.
The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 is 22.5%, down from 34.0% in 2008, and is expected to be about 31.5% for full-year 2009. Consistent with our business strategy, our intent to reinvest the earnings in certain of our non-US subsidiaries overseas allowed us to reduce taxes accrued with respect to 2009 earnings as well as certain taxes accrued in prior periods by $63 million.
FIRST-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2008
Earnings per share of $1.02 in the first quarter of 2009 on revenue of $2.002 billion, compares with $0.54 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 on revenue of $2.673 billion. Expenses in the first quarter of 2009 are $1.304 billion compared with $2.311 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Return on common shareholders equity is 15.7% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. References to fourth-quarter 2008 results are to the updated results announced on February 5, 2009.
On an operating basis earnings per common share in the first quarter of 2009 of $1.04 is down from $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an operating basis, total revenue in the first quarter is $2.027 billion, down 23.2% versus $2.641 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an operating basis, total expenses for the first quarter of 2009 are $1.287 billion versus $1.528 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating-basis return on common shareholders equity of 15.9% in the first quarter compares with 24.3% in the fourth quarter.
Servicing fees are $766 million, down 9% from $842 million in the fourth quarter and includes the impact of an 11% decline in daily average equity valuations. Management fees are $181 million, down 13% from $209 million primarily due to a 15% decline in average month-end equity valuations. Trading services revenue is $245 million, down 41% from $418 million primarily due to decreased volatility and lower volumes in the foreign exchange markets and to a decline in our core brokerage business as well as the impact of market values on the trading account. Securities finance revenue is $181 million, down 45% from the prior quarter primarily due to lower spreads as the benefit of the Federal Reserves December rate reductions dissipates as well as lower demand. Processing fees and other revenue declined to $49 million from $83 million due to lower revenue from structured products. Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $589 million, down 27% from $811 million, due primarily to the decline in Libor rates after year end and narrower spreads in both the investment portfolio and on customer deposits.
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 5% to $731 million from $698 million due to the impact of the significant reduction in 2008 incentive compensation recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, partially offset by the impact of the headcount reduction. Transaction processing expense is down 10% from $145 million to $131 million due to lower volumes in the asset servicing (or securities processing) business.Other expenses are down 64% from $398 million to $143 million due primarily to reduced securities processing costs and a decline in professional fees.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share.
This press release includes financial information presented on a GAAP-basis as well as on an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release.
Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each separately determined on a GAAP or an operating basis.

ABCP Conduits APPENDIX
ABCP Conduits  Appendix The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) asset-backed commercial paper conduit program. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.  We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature.  Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include automobile and equipment (Auto), credit cards, government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, U.S. residential mortgage-backed security (U.S. RMBS), U.S. Home Equity Line of Credit (U.S. RMBS-HELOC), Australian residential mortgage-backed security (AUS RMBS), U.K. residential mortgage-backed security (UK RMBS), and European residential mortgage-backed security (European RMBS).  As noted in the slides, State Streets asset-backed commercial paper conduit program contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below.  SFL         Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.  INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR ASSET-BACKED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT PROGRAM
ABCP Conduits  Appendix Autos: Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2000) going back to 1997 using 80% Lehman Prime Auto  Index and 20% Lehman Near Prime Auto Index  U.S. Credit Cards: Based on the high end of industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Most  projections exceed the historical high of 7.5%.  Non-U.S. Credit Cards: Based on Fitchs published expectations of stress performance for major European credit card  master trusts.  Government Student Loans: Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006.  Private Student Loans: Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 16% with a recovery rate of  approximately 50%.  U.S. RMBS: Based on the February 2009 S&P revised Alt-A and Prime cumulative default rate curves across vintages.  U.S. RMBS-HELOC: Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss  rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.  AUS RMBS: Based on twice the average cumulative mortgage insurance claims frequency of 0.72%.  UK RMBS: Based on a simple average of the five worst historical performing vintages experienced in the UK (1987-1991).  European RMBS: Based on the UK RMBS SFL as a proxy of the European market as a whole
.
ABCP Conduits  Appendix  HCL  Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.   Avg. CE   Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination.   Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure   of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.  As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.

Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.  We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below.  SFL  Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.  INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006.  Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 16.6% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%.  Credit Cards:  Based on the high end of industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Most projections exceed the historical high of 7.5%.   Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 79% Barclays prime auto index, 20% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 56% US, 44% non-US weighted basis.  Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with that used by rating agencies  CLOs:  Based on an industry projection of 12% spec. grade default rate with half of the long-term recovery rate on senior secured bank loans of 70%. The average recover rate of 70% is from data covering issues from 1982-2005.  Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 60% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages then applied to obtain the stressed future net loss.  HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.
Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee.  Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption.   Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption.   CMBS:  Based on the worst historical cumulative loss ever experienced by any one CMBS securitized deal.  U.S. RMBS:  Based on the July 2008 S&P cumulative Alt-A default rate curve.  U.S. RMBS-HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.  AUS RMBS:  Based on twice the average cumulative mortgage insurance claims frequency of 0.72%.  UK RMBS:  Based on twice the worst annual cumulative net loss experience in the UK (1989).  European RMBS:  Based on the UK RMBS SFL as a proxy of the European market as a whole.   Investment Portfolio  Appendix
Investment Portfolio - Appendix   HCL  Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.  Avg. CE  Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination.  Coverage  Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.   As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
