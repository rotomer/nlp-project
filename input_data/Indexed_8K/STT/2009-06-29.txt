On June 25, 2009, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provided State Street Bank and Trust Company, State Street Corporation's principal subsidiary, with a "Wells" notice. The notice relates to an ongoing SEC investigation into disclosures and management by State Street Global Advisors of certain active fixed-income strategies during 2007 and prior periods. The Wells notice informs State Street that the SEC staff intends to ask the SEC Commissioners for permission to bring a civil enforcement action for possible violations of the securities laws. State Street has been cooperating with the SEC in this inquiry and continues to cooperate with the Massachusetts Secretary of State, the Massachusetts Attorney General and other regulators in their related inquiries. Under the process established by the SEC, State Street will have an opportunity to present its perspective on these issues before any formal decision is made on an enforcement proceeding.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
