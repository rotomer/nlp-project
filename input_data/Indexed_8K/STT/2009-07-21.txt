Exhibit 99.1
State Street Corporation Reports Second-Quarter 2009 Earnings Per Share of $0.79 before Extraordinary Loss Due to Conduit Consolidation, Which Includes Previously Disclosed Repayment of TARP CPP of $0.23 Per Share
Operating-Basis Earnings Per Share Are $1.04 in Second Quarter
Fee Revenue Increased 7% Compared to First Quarter and Continued Expense Control Drives Q2 2009 Positive Operating Leverage on an Operating Basis, Relative to Both Q2 2008 and Q1 2009
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 21, 2009--State Street Corporation today announced second-quarter results per common share of $(7.12), including an after-tax extraordinary loss of $(7.91) per share related to the effect of the previously disclosed consolidation of the State Street-administered asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits onto the Companys balance sheet, $(0.23) per share related to repayment of the U.S. Treasurys TARP CPP investment, and $(0.02) per share in merger and integration costs associated with the 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp. (Investors Financial) . Revenue of $2.122 billion in the second quarter of 2009 is down 20.6% from $2.672 billion in the year-ago second quarter. Total expenses in the second quarter of 2009 of $1.364 billion are down 25.9% compared to $1.841 billion in the year-ago second quarter. As reflected in the after-tax per share loss noted above, the Company recorded an extraordinary pre-tax loss in the second quarter of $(6.096) billion as a result of the previously reported consolidation of the ABCP conduits. For the second quarter of 2009, before the extraordinary loss and reflecting the effect of the equity issuances in 2008 and 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 13.0%, down from 18.6% in the second quarter of 2008.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release. Also see Additional Information.
The following table reconciles GAAP-basis results to results presented on an operating basis:
Operating-basis results in the second quarter of 2009 exclude the effects noted above of the TARP repayment, the consolidation of the ABCP conduits and $(12) million in pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with the Investors Financial acquisition. Operating-basis results for the second quarter of 2008 excluded merger and integration costs of $(32) million associated with the Investors Financial acquisition. Operating-basis results for the first quarter of 2009 excluded $(17) million in merger and integration costs associated with the Investors Financial acquisition and $7 million of net interest revenue associated with the Federal Reserves AMLF. Operating-basis revenue for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. The tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital status. The tier 1 common ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP. The TCE and TCE/risk- weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital status. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this press release for reconciliations applicable to the TCE ratio.
Operating-basis earnings per common share in the second quarter of 2009 are $1.04, down 25.7% from $1.40 per share in the second quarter of 2008. Operating-basis revenue of $2.153 billion in the second quarter of 2009 is down 20.3% from $2.700 billion in the second quarter a year ago. Operating-basis expenses of $1.352 billion in the second quarter of 2009 are down 25.3% from $1.809 billion in the year-ago quarter. These second quarter 2009 revenue and expense results represent 500 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2008. For the second quarter of 2009, operating-basis return on common shareholders equity is 17.0%, down from 19.3% for the second quarter of 2008.
The balance sheet is $153 billion at June 30, 2009, compared to $142 billion at March 31, 2009. Excluding $20 billion in excess deposits held at central banks at June 30, 2009, compared with $30 billion at March 31, 2009, the normalized balance sheet was $133 billion at June 30, 2009, compared to a normalized balance sheet of $112 billion at March 31, 2009. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of June 30, 2009, with our tier 1 capital ratio at 14.5% and our leverage ratio at 7.3%. In addition, our tier 1 common ratio is 12.5%, our TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio is 8.5%, and our TCE ratio is 5.0%.
At June 30, 2009, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the consolidated investment portfolio are $4.75 billion, down from $5.85 billion after-tax at March 31, 2009 and down from $6.32 billion after-tax as of December 31, 2008.
Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "While markets have remained challenging, we achieved a number of significant milestones during the second quarter. We strengthened our TCE ratio, passed the Federal Reserve's stress test, conducted a successful equity and debt issuance in mid-May, and re-paid the TARP CPP preferred stock investment in June. We also repurchased the TARP common stock warrant in early July. With these actions, our capital ratios are among the strongest in our industry, and we have performed well against the TCE Improvement Plan that we announced on February 5.
Logue continued, Fee revenue in the second quarter increased 7% from the first quarter. This performance, combined with our continued focus on expense control, resulted in 500 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter of 2008 and 110 basis points on a sequential-quarter basis, each on an operating basis. We remain focused on what we can control  servicing our customers, managing our expenses and investing for the future.
SECOND QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO SECOND QUARTER
Servicing fees are down 19% to $795 million from $977 million in last years second quarter. The decrease is attributable primarily to the approximately 38% decline in daily average equity valuations. Total assets under custody and administration are $16.39 trillion at June 30, 2009, down 17%, compared with $19.73 trillion at June 30, 2008. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are down35% from the second quarter of 2008; daily average values for the MSCI EAFE Index are down 41% from the same period.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $193 million, down 31% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in management fees is attributable primarily to the approximately 36% decrease in average month-end equity valuations. Total assets under management at June 30, 2009, are $1.56 trillion, down 18%, compared to $1.89 trillion at June 30, 2008.
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $310 million for the second quarter of 2009, down 3% from $320 million the second quarter a year-ago. A 16% decrease in foreign exchange revenue is due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher volatility. Brokerage and other fees increased 29% due primarily to improved transition management business
.
Securities finance revenue is $201 million in the quarter, down 43% from $352 million in the very strong year-ago second quarter. This significant decline is due primarily to lower volumes, offset partially by slightly higher spreads.
Processing fees and other is $17 million, down 78% from $77 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decline is primarily due to lower revenue from structured products, as well as the consolidation of the ABCP conduits onto our balance sheet. As a result of the consolidation, the fees earned from conduit activities after May 15 are reported as net interest revenue.
Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $611 million, a decrease of 11% from $685 million in the year-ago second quarter. The decline is due primarily to the decrease in customer deposit volumes and spreads, partially offset by $112 million of discount accretion on securities in the investment portfolio recorded following the consolidation of the ABCP conduits.
In the quarter, due to the improving markets, we recorded $26 million in net gains related to investment securities$90 million from sales of securities, partially offset by $64 million in other-than-temporary impairment. In addition, we recorded a $14 million provision for loan losses in order to provide for expected losses related to the commercial mortgage loans held on our balance sheet that were acquired in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Operating-basis expenses decreased to $1.352 billion, down 25.3% from $1.809 billion a year ago, due primarily to a 34% reduction in salaries and benefits expense due to a lower level of accrual for incentive compensation as well as the benefit of the reduction in force. Other expenses also declined due to measures which we undertook that contributed to a 26% decrease.
The decrease in total expenses also includes lower transaction processing services, down 15% to $146 million from $172 million a year ago, due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business. Occupancy increased 5% to $121 million from $115 million. Other expenses were down 26% or $76 million to $222 million from $298 million due primarily to lower professional fees and lower securities processing costs, partially offset by a special assessment from the FDIC.
The effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2009 is 32.6%, down from 34.0% in the second quarter of 2008. It is expected to be 30.7% for full-year 2009.
SECOND-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. FIRST QUARTER 2009
The GAAP loss per share of $(7.12) in the second quarter of 2009 on revenue of $2.122 billion, compares with earnings per share of $1.02 per share in the first quarter of 2009 on revenue of $2.002 billion. Expenses in the second quarter of 2009 are $1.364 billion, compared with $1.304 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Return on common shareholders equity is 13.0% in the second quarter of 2009, which excludes the impact of the extraordinary loss, compared to 15.7% in the first quarter of 2009.
The following information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings per common share in the second quarter of 2009 of $1.04 are flat with the first quarter of 2009. Total revenue in the second quarter is $2.153 billion, up 6.2% versus $2.027 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Total expenses for the second quarter of 2009 are $1.352 billion, up 5.1% compared to $1.287 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Return on common shareholders equity of 17.0% in the second quarter compares with 15.9% in the first quarter.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis revenue:
Servicing fees are $795 million, up 4% from $766 million in the first quarter due primarily to the approximately 12% increase in daily average equity valuations, as well as new business. Management fees are $193 million, up 7% from $181 million primarily due to the greater than 16% increase in the average month-end equity valuations and net new business. Trading services revenue is $310 million, up 27% from $245 million primarily due to strength in brokerage and other fee revenue. Securities finance revenue is $201 million, up 11% from the prior quarter primarily due to higher spreads as well as higher volumes. Processing fees and other revenue declined 65% from $49 million to $17 million due to lower revenue from structured products. In addition, the fees earned from the ABCP conduit activities were reported as net interest revenue after consolidation of the conduits on May 15, 2009. Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $611 million, up 4% from $589 million, due primarily to the effect of $112 million of discount accretion recorded following the consolidation of the conduits, offset partially by the decline in Libor rates and narrower spreads both in the investment portfolio and on customer deposits.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis expenses:
Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 5% to $696 million from $731 million primarily due to a lower level of 2009 incentive compensation. Information systems and communications increased 3.7% from $161 million to $167 million due to increases in investment servicing. Transaction processing expense is up 11% from $131 million to $146 million due to higher volumes in the asset servicing business. Other expenses are up 55% from $143 million to $222 million due to increases in FDIC fees, including a special assessment, professional fees and securities processing costs.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on common shareholders equity is determined by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity for the period. Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each separately determined on a GAAP or an operating basis.
This press release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release.
Management believes that the use of other non-GAAP financial measures in the calculation of identified capital ratios is useful to understanding State Streets capital position and of interest to investors. Below is a description of, and other information with respect to, the capital ratios referenced in this press release.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements and, as permitted, exclude the impact of commercial paper purchased under the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostons AMLF.
The tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. However, this ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its stress test administered to the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies under the SCAP, the results of which were announced on May 7, 2009. Although we understand that the Federal Reserve does not intend to prospectively require calculation of the tier 1 common ratio, due to the recent timing of the SCAP, management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this press release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to unaudited tier 1 common capital as of June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
, is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF and cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE ratio as of June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). As permitted by bank regulations, risk-weighted assets exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF. The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE/RWA ratio as of June 30, 2009, March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2008 are included in the addendum at the end of this press release

Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
Investment Portfolio - Appendix The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below.SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.  INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Investment Portfolio - Appendix Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006.Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%.Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle.Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis.Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with that used by rating agencies Spanish MBS: 3.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate. Italian MBS: 1.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate. Russian MBS: 8.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Russian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate. Greek MBS: 1.0% Used an additional 2-3x stress to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure,   which was 0.7% Portuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Portuguese RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a    historically conservative recovery rate. CLOs:  Based on an industry projection of 12% spec. grade default rate with half of the long-term recovery rate on senior secured bank loans of 70%. The average recover rate of 70% is from data covering issues from 1982-2005.
Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss.HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee.Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS:  Based on the worst historical cumulative loss ever experienced by any one CMBS securitized deal. Investment Portfolio - Appendix
Investment Portfolio - Appendix HCL Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.Avg. CE Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination.Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario. As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
