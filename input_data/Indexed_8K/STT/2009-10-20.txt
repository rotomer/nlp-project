Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports Third-Quarter 2009 Earnings Per Share of $1.04
Total Revenue Increases 5% Compared to Second Quarter with Servicing Fees up 5% and Management Fees up 13%
Continued Expense Control Drives Q3 2009 Positive Operating Leverage Relative to Q3 2008
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 20, 2009--State Street Corporation today announced third-quarter 2009 earnings per common share of $1.04 on revenue of $2.236 billion compared with $1.09 per share on revenue of $2.771 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Expenses in the third quarter of 2009 are $1.483 billion, compared with $1.925 billion in the third quarter of 2008. For the third quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 16.0%, up from 13.6% in the third quarter of 2008.
Compared to the second quarter of 2009, third-quarter 2009 results improved from a loss of $(7.12) per share on revenue of $2.122 billion. The second quarter of 2009 includes an after-tax extraordinary loss of $(3.684) billion or $(7.91) per share related to the effect of the consolidation of the State Street-administered asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits onto the Companys balance sheet. Expenses in the second quarter of 2009 were $1.364 billion. For the second quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 13.0% before the extraordinary loss.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release. Also see Additional Information.
Operating-basis results in the third quarter of 2009 of $1.05 per share exclude $(11) million in pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with the Investors Financial Services Corp. (Investors Financial) acquisition. Operating-basis results for the third quarter of 2008 excluded a $350 million gain on the sale of CitiStreet, $8 million of net interest revenue from acting as an intermediary under the AMLF, a reduction of net interest revenue of $(98) million to establish a reserve for the SILO transactions, a charge of $(200) million for a reserve to address our estimated net exposure on an indemnification obligation associated with collateralized repurchase agreements with Lehman, and merger and integration costs of $(30) million associated with the acquisition of Investors Financial. Excluding the extraordinary loss, operating-basis results for the second quarter of 2009 also exclude $(106) million related to repayment of the U.S. Treasurys TARP CPP investment, and $(12) million in merger and integration costs associated with the Investors Financial acquisition. Net interest revenue on an operating basis for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. The tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital status. The tier 1 common ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP. The TCE and TCE/risk- weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital status. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this press release for reconciliations applicable to the TCE ratios.
Operating-basis earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2009 are $1.05, down 15.3% from $1.24 per share in the third quarter of 2008. Operating-basis revenue of $2.267 billion in the third quarter of 2009 is down 10.6% from $2.536 billion in the third quarter a year ago. Operating-basis expenses of $1.472 billion in the third quarter of 2009 are down 13.2% from $1.695 billion in the year-ago quarter. These third quarter 2009 revenue and expense results represent 260 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the third quarter of 2008. For the third quarter of 2009, operating-basis return on common shareholders equity is 16.2%, up from 15.4% for the third quarter of 2008.
Total assets are $163 billion at September 30, 2009, compared to $153 billion at June 30, 2009. Excluding $22 billion in excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks at September 30, 2009, compared with $20 billion at June 30, 2009, the normalized balance sheet was $141 billion at September 30, 2009, compared to a normalized balance sheet of $133 billion at June 30, 2009. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of September 30, 2009, with our tier 1 capital ratio at 15.6% and our leverage ratio at 8.2%. In addition, our tier 1 common ratio is 13.6%, our TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio is 10.5%, and our TCE ratio is 5.7%, well ahead of the ratio of 4.29% we projected in February at our Investor and Analyst Forum due to organic growth, the successful equity raise in May, and the improvement in unrealized losses.
pro forma
At September 30, 2009, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio are $2.98 billion, down from $4.75 billion after-tax at June 30, 2009 and down from $6.32 billion after-tax as of December 31, 2008.
Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Although the economic environment appears to be gradually recovering, the pace of the rebound is slow. Equity markets have improved, providing some support to our servicing and management fee revenue and as liquidity returns to the credit markets, spreads have tightened, thus allowing further continued declines in the unrealized loss in our investment portfolio. In this environment we remain cautious and continue to build our capital ratios, which today are among the strongest in our industry.
Logue continued, Compared to the second quarter, servicing fees and management fees both increased, reflecting equity market improvement as well as new business. The increases in servicing and management fee revenue, however, were more than offset by seasonal weakness in other areas of fee revenue, most notably securities finance, which was also negatively affected by spread compression, and trading revenue. Our net interest margin improved to 247 basis points, up 54 basis points from the second quarter, but declined one basis point to 156 basis points excluding the impact of $279 million of discount accretion associated with the consolidation of the ABCP conduits in the second quarter. The low interest-rate environment is not favorable to the yield on our investment portfolio.
Logue concluded, Our revenue performance this quarter, combined with our continued focus on expense control, resulted in 260 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the third quarter of 2008. We expected our second half of 2009 to be stronger than it now appears to be. Given the slow pace of the recovery, our outlook for 2009 has changed slightly: we now expect operating revenue to decline about 16 percent from the record level of 2008 and operating earnings per share to be between $4.13 and $4.17. We expect operating return on equity to be between 14 and 17 percent in line with our long-term outlook.
THIRD-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO THIRD QUARTER
Servicing fees are down 14% to $833 million from $966 million in last years third quarter. The decrease is attributable primarily to the impact of declining markets. Total assets under custody and administration are $17.935 trillion at September 30, 2009, down 2.8%, compared with $18.447 trillion at September 30, 2008. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index and the MSCI EAFE Index are each down approximately 20% from the third quarter of 2008.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $219 million, down 16% from $261 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in management fees is attributable primarily to the approximately 16% decrease in average month-end equity valuations, as well as a change in the composition of assets under management from active to passive strategies.Total assets under management at September 30, 2009, are $1.735 trillion, up 2.9% compared to $1.686 trillion at September 30, 2008.
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $269 million for the third quarter of 2009, down 26% from $363 million in the third quarter a year-ago. A 41% decrease in foreign exchange revenue is due to lower volatility as well as lower volumes. Brokerage and other fees increased 11% due primarily to increases in electronic trading.
Securities finance revenue is $105 million in the quarter, down 57% from $246 million in the year-ago third quarter due primarily to compressed spreads as well as lower volumes.
Processing fees and other is $45 million, down 29% from $63 million in the third quarter of 2008. The decline is primarily due to the consolidation of the ABCP conduits onto our balance sheet in May 2009. As a result of the consolidation, the fees formerly earned from conduit activities are reported as net interest revenue.
Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $754 million, an increase of 18% from $640 million in the year-ago third quarter. The increase is due to the $279 million of discount accretion on securities in the investment portfolio recorded following the consolidation of the ABCP conduits. This increase is offset partially by lower rates negatively affecting the yield on floating-rate assets, and both lower volumes and spreads on customer deposits. Net interest margin of 247 basis points increased 25 basis points in the third quarter, compared to 222 basis points in the third quarter of 2008; excluding discount accretion, the net interest margin would have been 156 basis points.
In the quarter, due to the improving markets, we recorded $42 million in net gains related to investment securities$141million in gains from sales of securities, partially offset by $99 million in other-than-temporary impairment related to credit. In addition, we recorded a $16 million provision for loan losses
.
Operating-basis expenses decreased to $1.472 billion, down 13% from $1.695 billion in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of a 20% reduction in salaries and benefits expense due to the effect of a reduction in force as well as a lower level of incentive compensation.
The decrease in total expenses also includes lower transaction processing services, down 10% to $148 million from $165 million in the year-ago quarter, due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business. Other expenses were down from $241 million to $222 million due primarily to lower professional fees and lower securities processing costs.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2009 is 30.0%, down from 43.7% on a GAAP basis and from 34.0% on an operating basis in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in the rate is due to our decision in the first quarter to reinvest earnings in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries overseas as well as lower earnings from jurisdictions with higher tax rates. The tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30% for full-year 2009.
THIRD-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. SECOND QUARTER 2009
The following information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2009 are $1.05, an increase of 1.0% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Total revenue in the third quarter is $2.267 billion, up 5.3% versus $2.153 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Total expenses for the third quarter of 2009 are $1.472 billion, up 8.9% compared to $1.352 billion in the second quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, to execute our TCE improvement plan, we had not accrued for performance-based incentive compensation; however, in the third quarter of 2009 we accrued about $100 million for this benefit. Return on common shareholders equity of 16.2% in the third quarter compares with 17.0% in the second quarter.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis revenue:
(1) Both amounts include a $31 million tax-equivalent adjustment, which increased GAAP-basis net interest revenue of $723 million and $580 million, respectively, for the periods.
Servicing fees are $833 million, up 5% from $795 million in the second quarter due primarily to the approximately 14% increase in daily average equity valuations, as well as new business. Management fees are $219 million, up 13% from $193 million primarily due to the approximately 14% increase in the average month-end equity valuations and net new business. Trading services revenue is $269 million, down 13% from $310 million. Securities finance revenue is $105 million, down 48% from the prior quarter primarily due to compressed spreads. Processing fees and other revenue increased from $17 million to $45 million Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $754 million, up 23% from $611 million, due primarily to the higher level of discount accretion ($279 million versus $112 million in the second quarter), partially offset by the impact of the decline in Libor rates on the investment portfolio.
.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis expenses:
Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 18% to $819 million from $696 million primarily due to a $100 million accrual for performance-based incentive compensation in the third quarter. Expenses on all other lines were approximately flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on common shareholders equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity for the period. Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
This press release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release.
Management believes that the use of other non-GAAP financial measures in the calculation of identified capital ratios is useful to understanding State Streets capital position and of interest to investors. Below is a description of, and other information with respect to, the capital ratios referenced in this press release.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements and, as permitted, exclude the impact of commercial paper purchased under the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostons AMLF.
The tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. However, this ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its stress test administered to the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies under the SCAP, the results of which were announced on May 7, 2009. Although we understand that the Federal Reserve does not intend to prospectively require calculation of the tier 1 common ratio, due to the recent timing of the SCAP, management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this press release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
Reconciliations with respect to unaudited tier 1 common capital as of September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release.
, is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF and cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE ratio as of September 30, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). As permitted by bank regulations, risk-weighted assets exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF. The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry.

State Street Investment Portfolio APPENDIX 17
State Street Investment Portfolio  Appendix INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month. We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below. SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below. 18
State Street Investment Portfolio  Appendix Government Student Loans: Based on the average Sallie Mae Non consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006. Private Student Loans: Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%. Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis. Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with that used by rating agencies Spanish MBS: 3.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate. Italian MBS: 1.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate. Russian MBS: 8.0%   Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Russian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate. Greek MBS: 1.0% Used an additional 2-3x stress to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure, which was 0.7% Portuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Portuguese RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate. CLOs: Based on an industry projection of 12% spec. grade default rate with half of the long-term recovery rate on senior secured bank loans of 70%. The average recover rate of 70% is from data covering issues from 1982-2005. 19
State Street Subprime: Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss. HELOC: Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates. Agency MBS: No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee. Non-Agency MBS (Prime): Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A): Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS: Based on the worst historical cumulative loss ever experienced by any one CMBS securitized deal. Investment Portfolio  Appendix 20
State Street Investment Portfolio  Appendix HCL Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. Avg. CE Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination. Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario. As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses. 21
