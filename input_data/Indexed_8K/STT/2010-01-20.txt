Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $1.00
Total Revenue Increases 2% Compared to Third Quarter with Servicing Fees up 6% and Management Fees up 5%
Achieves Full-Year Positive Operating Leverage Compared to 2008
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 20, 2010--State Street Corporation today announced fourth-quarter 2009 earnings per common share of $1.00 on revenue of $2.280 billion compared with $0.54 per share on revenue of $2.673 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 are $1.565 billion, compared with $2.311 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the fourth quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 14.0%, up from 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Compared to the third quarter of 2009, fourth-quarter 2009 results improved from $0.66 per share on revenue of $2.236 billion. Expenses in the third quarter of 2009 were $1.733 billion. For the third quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 10.2%.
The 2009 results included an after-tax extraordinary loss of $(3.684) billion or $(7.77) per share related to the effect of the May 2009 consolidation of the State Street-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits onto the Companys balance sheet. In 2009, State Street reported full-year earnings per share of $3.46, before the extraordinary loss, on revenue of $8.640 billion compared with earnings per share of $4.30 on revenue of $10.693 billion in 2008. Including the extraordinary loss, the full-year 2009 loss per share was $(4.31). Return on common shareholders equity was 13.2% in 2009 before the extraordinary loss, compared with 14.8% in 2008.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release. Also see Additional Information. Net interest revenue on an operating basis for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Operating-basis results for 2009 exclude a pre-tax provision of $(250) million or $(0.37) per share related to an increase in the reserve established in 2007 to address legal exposure related to losses incurred by investors in certain fixed-income strategies managed by State Street Global Advisors, $(106) million or $(0.22) per share related to repayment of the U.S. Treasurys TARP Capital Purchase Program investment and $(49) million, or $(0.06) per share, of pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with the 2007 acquisition of Investors Financial Services Corp., which includes the fourth-quarter and third-quarter 2009 effects of $(9) million or $(0.01) per share and $(11) million or $(0.01) per share, respectively, for pre-tax merger and integration costs associated with that acquisition.
Operating-basis results for full-year 2008 exclude previously reported net pre-tax effects of $(751) million, or $(1.31) per share and for the fourth quarter of 2008 exclude previously reported net pre-tax effects of $(723) million, or $(1.04) per share. These items, including the related tax effects, are more fully described in the reconciliations of full-year and fourth-quarter 2008 operating-basis results in the addendum at the end of this press release.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. The tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 common ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. The TCE and TCE/risk-weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy. Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this press release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this press release for reconciliations applicable to the TCE ratios.
Operating-basis earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009 are $0.99 per share down 37.3% from $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating-basis revenue of $2.312 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 is down 12.5% from $2.641 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago. Operating-basis expenses of $1.556 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 are up 1.8% from $1.528 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2009, operating-basis return on common shareholders equity is 13.8%, down from 24.3% for the fourth quarter of 2008.
Operating-basis results for the full-year 2009 include earnings per share of $4.11 on revenue of $8.759 billion compared with earnings per share of $5.61 on revenue of $10.477 billion in 2008. Operating basis expenses for the full-year 2009 are $5.667 billion compared with $6.780 billion in 2008.
Total assets are $158 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $163 billion at September 30, 2009 and $174 billion at December 31, 2008. Excluding $22 billion in excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks at December 31, 2009, $22 billion at September 30, 2009, and $52 billion at December 31, 2008, the normalized balance sheet was $136 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to a normalized balance sheet of $141 billion at September 30, 2009 and $122 billion as of December 31, 2008. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of December 31, 2009, with the Companys tier 1 capital ratio at 17.5% and leverage ratio at 8.5%. In addition, the Companys tier 1 common ratio is 15.3%, its TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio is 12.6%, and its TCE ratio is 6.6%, well ahead of the projected TCE ratio of 4.91% the Company targeted in February 2009 at its Investor and Analyst Forum, which had been adjusted for consolidation of the asset-backed commercial paper conduits. This performance is due to organic capital generation, the successful equity raise in May, and the improvement in unrealized losses in the investment portfolio.
At December 31, 2009, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio are $2.29 billion, down from $2.98 billion at September 30, 2009, and down about 65% from $6.32 billion as of December 31, 2008.
Ronald E. Logue, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "In 2009 we focused on strengthening our capital, servicing our clients, and controlling expenses. For the full year, we added $1.13 trillion in assets to be serviced as well as $248 billion in net new business in asset management. Also, on an operating basis, we achieved full-year positive operating leverage compared to 2008. In particular, investment manager operations outsourcing, alternative investment servicing, as well as passive management and ETF strategies generated new business and, based on the current pipeline, that trend is continuing.Our core business momentum also continues;on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we grew our servicing fee and management fee revenue, and in the fourth quarter we announced two proposed cash acquisitions, that of the securities services business of Intesa Sanpaolo, a premier provider of investment services in Italy and Luxembourg and that of Mourant International Finance Administration, a leading servicer of alternative investment servicing.
Joseph L. Hooley, president and chief operating officer added, Given the past years quarterly momentum in servicing fee and management fee revenue, we are increasingly confident in our ability to grow revenue during 2010. However, we continue to face headwinds from the impact of market-driven revenue and expect the transition in market-driven revenue that began in 2009 to continue into 2010. Including discount accretion associated with the former conduit assets, we expect operating-basis earnings per share in 2010 to be modestly below the lower end of our 10 to 15 percent range. However, to create more transparency and to underscore our confidence in our core businesses, going forward, we will report our operating-basis financial results excluding both merger and integration costs as well as the impact of conduit discount accretion. On this basis, 2009 operating-basis revenue would have been $8.138 billion and operating-basis earnings per share would have been $3.32. We expect our 2010 operating-basis earnings per share, excluding merger and integration costs and conduit discount accretion, to be only slightly above the level of 2009, reflecting in part increased outstanding average shares.
Hooley concluded, We begin 2010 from a position of strength. We believe we are well positioned globally and that, over economic and market cycles, we will maintain our long-term financial goals of operating-basis revenue growth of 8 percent to 12 percent, growth in operating-basis earnings per share of 10 percent to 15 percent, and operating-basis return on equity of between 14 percent and 17 percent.
In 2009, discount accretion of $621 million, or $0.79 per share, contributed to State Streets capital strength, and the Company expects about $900 million, or $1.08 per share, in 2010, and expects about $5.3 billion in total on a pre-tax basis to accrete into revenue over the life of the assets, based on anticipated pre-payment speeds, credit quality and assuming the company holds the securities to maturity.
FOURTH-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO FOURTH QUARTER
Servicing fees are up 5% to $882 million from $842 million in last years fourth quarter. The increase is attributable primarily to the increase in daily average equity valuations and new business. Total assets under custody and administration are $18.795 trillion at December 31, 2009, up 18%, compared with $15.907 trillion at December 31, 2008. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index are up 19% and the MSCI EAFE Index increased approximately 28% from the fourth quarter of 2008.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, are $231 million, up 11% from $209 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in management fees is attributable primarily to the increase in average month-end equity valuations, as well as net new business, with the increase in assets partly offset by a change in asset mix.Average month-end equity valuations are up about 17% as measured by the S & P 500 and are up 28% as measured by the MSCI EAFE index. Total assets under management at December 31, 2009, are $1.911 trillion, up 32% compared to $1.444 trillion at December 31, 2008.
SM
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, is $270 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, down 35% from $418 million in the fourth quarter a year-ago. The 57% decrease in foreign exchange revenue is primarily due to lower volatility and lower volumes. Brokerage and other fees increased 47% due primarily to strength in transition management and increases in electronic trading.
Securities finance revenue is $83 million in the quarter, down 75% from $329 million in the year-ago fourth quarter due primarily to compressed spreads as well as lower volumes.
Processing fees and other is $60 million, down 28% from $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to several factors, none of which is material.
Net interest revenue on an operating basis is $729 million, a decrease of 10% from $811 million in the year-ago fourth quarter due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest-rate environment, and the decline in customer balances from the abnormally high levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, offset partially by the impact of discount accretion from the consolidated conduit assets. Net interest margin of 235 basis points in the fourth quarter was up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008; excluding discount accretion, the net interest margin would have been 161 basis points. The net interest margin for the full year is 220 basis points including discount accretion and would have been 169 basis points excluding discount accretion.
In the quarter, due to the improving markets, we recorded $108million of net gains from sales of securities, partially offset by $51 million of other-than-temporary impairment related to credit, resulting in $57 million of net gains related to investment securities. In addition, we recorded a $35 million provision for loan losses, primarily related to commercial real estate exposures
.
Operating-basis expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased to $1.556 billion, up 1.8% from $1.528 billion in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of a 13% increase in salaries and benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reversed approximately 50% of previously accrued full-year incentive compensation, resulting in a low level of salaries and benefits expense for the quarter. Transaction processing expense of $158 million increased 9% attributable to higher volumes in the investment servicing business, offset partially by a 7% reduction in occupancy expense, from $124 million to $115 million. Other expenses declined 17%, from $398 million to $329 million partially due to a lower level of governmental fees paid in 2009 compared to 2008.
The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009 is 28.5%, down from 35.3% on the same basis for the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in the rate is the result of an increase in the proportion of earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries where the intention is to reinvest the earnings indefinitely overseas, as well as to certain adjustments in prior year tax accruals. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately 30%.
FOURTH-QUARTER 2009 RESULTS VS. THIRD QUARTER 2009
The following information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009 are $0.99, a decrease of 5.7% compared with $1.05 in the third quarter of 2009. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of $2.312 billion, is up 2.0% from $2.267 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 are $1.556, up 5.7% from $1.472 billion in the third quarter of 2009. Return on common shareholders equity of 13.8% in the fourth quarter compares with 16.2% in the third quarter.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis revenue:
(1) The fourth quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2009 include $32 million and $31 million tax-equivalent adjustments, which increased GAAP-basis net interest revenue of $697 million and $723 million, respectively, for the periods.
Servicing fees are $882 million, up 6% from $833 million in the third quarter due primarily to new business as well as the increase in daily average equity valuations. Management fees are $231 million up 5% from $219 million primarily due to the increase in the average month-end equity valuations, and net new business.Trading services revenue is $270 million, compared to $269 million. Securities finance revenue is $83 million, down 21% from $105 million in the prior quarter primarily due to compressed spreads, partially offset by slightly increased volumes. Processing fees and other revenue increased from $45 million to $60 million Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis is $729 million, down 3% from $754 million due to a lower level of discount accretion ($230 million versus $279 million) caused by the absence of one-time pay-downs and slower prepayment rates, offset partially by the impact of the investment strategy which we began to execute in the third quarter.
.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis expenses:
Compared to the third quarter of 2009, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% to $791 million from $819 million primarily due to a $50 million decrease in discretionary cash incentive compensation accruals recorded in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing expenses increased 7% due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business and other expenses increased 48% to $329 million due primarily to an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in connection with SSgAs appointment of Lehman Brothers as prime broker for certain investment funds, and other securities processing costs. All other lines were approximately flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on common shareholders equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity for the period. Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
This press release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this press release.
Management believes that the use of other non-GAAP financial measures in the calculation of identified capital ratios is useful to understanding State Streets capital position and of interest to investors. Below is a description of, and other information with respect to, the capital ratios referenced in this press release.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements and, as permitted, exclude the impact of commercial paper purchased under the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostons AMLF.
The tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. However, this ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its stress test administered to the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, the results of which were announced on May 7, 2009. Although we understand that the Federal Reserve does not intend to prospectively require calculation of the tier 1 common ratio, due to the recent timing of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this press release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
Reconciliations with respect to unaudited tier 1 common capital as of December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release.
, is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF and cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE ratio as of December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008 are provided in the addendum at the end of this press release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing total consolidated common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by total risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). As permitted by bank regulations, total risk-weighted assets exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF. The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE/RWA ratio as of December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009, and December 31, 2008 are included in the addendum at the end of this press release.

Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month. We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below. SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.  INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006. Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%. Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis. Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with that used by rating agencies Spanish MBS: 3.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate.  Italian MBS: 1.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate. Russian MBS: 8.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Russian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate. Greek MBS: 1.0% Used an additional 2-3x stress to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure,   which was 0.7% Portuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Portuguese RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a    historically conservative recovery rate. CLOs:  Based on an industry projection of 12% spec. grade default rate with half of the long-term recovery rate on senior secured bank loans of 70%. The average recovery rate of 70% is from data covering issues from 1982-2005.
Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss. HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates. Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee. Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS:  Based on the worst historical cumulative loss ever experienced by any one CMBS securitized deal. Investment Portfolio - Appendix
Investment Portfolio - Appendix HCL Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. Avg. CE Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination. Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario. As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
