EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports First-Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.99
Operating-Basis Earnings Per Share of $0.75 Up from the Fourth Quarter with 100 Basis Points of Positive Operating Leverage
Fee Revenue Increases 8% Compared to First Quarter of 2009 with Servicing Fees up 15% and Management Fees up 25%
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 20, 2010--State Street Corporation today announced first-quarter 2010 earnings per common share of $0.99 on revenue of $2.296 billion compared with $1.02 per share on revenue of $2.002 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $1.579 billion, compared with $1.304 billion in the first quarter of 2009. For the first quarter of 2010, return on common shareholders equity was 13.4%, down from 15.7% in the first quarter of 2009.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, first-quarter 2010 revenue, expenses and earnings per share were essentially flat. In the fourth quarter of 2009, revenue was $2.280 billion, expenses were $1.565 billion, and earnings per share were $1.00. For the fourth quarter of 2009, return on common shareholders equity was 14.0%.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this news release. Also see Additional Information. Operating-basis net interest revenue for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes discount accretion related to the conduit assets.
As we indicated in announcing the 2009 full-year and fourth-quarter results, we are now presenting operating-basis results excluding the net interest revenue associated with the discount accretion from the consolidation of the asset-backed commercial paper conduits in the second quarter of 2009 (in addition to the other adjustments we have historically reflected). First-quarter 2010 GAAP results included $212 million of discount accretion, as well as $13 million of merger and integration costs associated with acquisitions. GAAP results in the first quarter of 2009 included $17 million of merger and integration costs associated with Investors Financial Services Corp. (IFIN), partially offset by net interest revenue of $7 million related to State Streets participation in the Federal Reserve Banks Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2009 included $230 million of discount accretion and $9 million of merger and integration costs.
Operating-basis revenue in the first quarter of 2010 was $2.116 billion, up 4.4% from $2.027 billion in the first quarter of 2009 and operating-basis expenses were $1.566 billion, up 21.7% from $1.287 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Operating-basis revenue in the first quarter of 2010 was up 1.6% from $2.082 in fourth quarter of 2009 and operating-basis expenses in the first quarter of 2010 were $1.566 billion, up 0.6% from $1.556 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. These first quarter 2010 revenue and expense results represent 100 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating-basis earnings per share in the first quarter of 2010 were $0.75 compared to operating-basis earnings per share of $1.04 in the first quarter of 2009 and $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an operating basis, return on equity of 10.0% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 15.9% in the first quarter of 2009 and 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's president and chief executive officer, said, "Our core business performed well, demonstrated by the 8 percent increase in fee revenue compared to the prior-year first quarter due to strength in servicing and asset management fee revenue. In the quarter, our asset servicing businesses added $164 billion in assets to be serviced. Within asset management, net customer cash flows, including customer wins and losses, were modestly negative. This decline, however, was more than offset by appreciation of assets under management, with total assets under management remaining in excess of $1.9 trillion at March 31, 2010. These new wins, our solid sales pipeline, as well as the continued installations of large wins from last year, give us confidence that our core business will continue to perform well. Our capital levels remain strong and are well in excess of the regulatory well capitalized requirements. We achieved 100 basis points of operating leverage compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, as we continued to manage expenses very carefully.
Hooley continued, Spread compression continue to impact securities finance and weak cross-border customer volumes and low volatility continue to restrain foreign exchange. These headwinds, plus the low interest-rate environment, have shaped our view of 2010 as a transition year to a more normalized environment. We closed the Mourant International Finance Administration acquisition in early April and anticipate closing our proposed acquisition of Intesa Sanpaolos Securities Services business later this quarter, pending regulatory approval and satisfaction of other closing conditions. We expect the two acquisitions to add to revenue and to be modestly accretive to operating-basis earnings this year. As a result, we continue to expect that our operating-basis earnings per share will be slightly higher than the operating-basis $3.32 per share last year, excluding discount accretion.
Hooley concluded, We continue to believe we are well positioned against global growth opportunities and that, over economic and market cycles, we will maintain our long-term financial goals of operating-basis revenue growth of 8 percent to 12 percent, growth in operating-basis earnings per share of 10 percent to 15 percent, and operating-basis return on equity of between 14 percent and 17 percent.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. The tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 common ratio was used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. The TCE and TCE/risk-weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy. Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations applicable to the tier 1 common and TCE ratios.
Total assets were $154 billion at March 31, 2010, compared with $158 billion at December 31, 2009 and $142 billion at March 31, 2009. Excluding $19 billion of excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks at March 31, 2010, $22 billion at December 31, 2009, and $30 billion at March 31, 2009, the normalized balance sheet was $135 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to a normalized balance sheet of $136 billion at December 31, 2009 and $112 billion at March 31, 2009. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of March 31, 2010, with the Companys tier 1 capital ratio at 18.1% and its leverage ratio at 9.0%. In addition, at that date, the Companys tier 1 common ratio was 15.9%, its TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio was 14.1%, and its TCE ratio was 7.5%.
At March 31, 2010, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio were $1.44 billion, down from $2.29 billion at December 31, 2009, and down about 75% from $5.85 billion as of March 31, 2009.
In the first quarter of 2010, discount accretion of $212 million, or $0.25 per share, contributed to State Streets capital strength, and the Company expects a total of about $800 million of accretion in 2010, and expects about $4.1billion in total on a pre-tax basis to accrete into interest revenue over the remaining lives of the assets, based on anticipated pre-payments, credit quality, sales-to-date, and assuming the Company holds the securities to maturity.
FIRST-QUARTER 2010 RESULTS VS. YEAR-AGO FIRST QUARTER
Servicing fees were up 15% to $880 million from $766 million in last years first quarter. The increase was attributable primarily to new business as well as the increase in daily average equity valuations.Total assets under custody and administration were $19.041 trillion at March 31, 2010, up 27%, compared with $15.035 trillion at March 31, 2009. Daily average values for the S&P 500 Index were up 39% and the MSCI EAFE Index increased approximately 43% from the first quarter of 2009.
SM
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $226 million, up 25% from $181 million in the year-ago quarter The increase in management fees was attributable primarily to the increase in average month-end equity valuationsAverage month-end equity valuations were up about 42% as measured by the S & P 500 and were up 45% as measured by the MSCI EAFE index. Total assets under management at March 31, 2010, were $1.929 trillion, up 38% compared to $1.395 trillion at March 31, 2009.

SM
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was $242 million for the first quarter of 2010, down slightly from $245 million in the first quarter a year ago. Foreign exchange revenue decreased 30% primarily due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fees doubled due primarily to strength in electronic trading. In the first quarter of 2009, brokerage fee revenue was affected by lower market valuations on several securities held in the trading account.
Securities finance revenue was $72 million in the quarter, down 60% from $181 million in the year-ago first quarter due primarilto compressed spreads, partially offset by slightly higher volumes.
y
Processing fees and other revenue was $120 million, up 145% from $49 million in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to a gain from an early buyout of a legacy leasing transaction and improved revenue from structured products.
Net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis (including a taxequivalent adjustment of $32 million and discount accretion of $212 million) was $693 million, and on an operating basis, excluding discount accretion, was $481 million, a decrease of 18% from $589 million in the year-ago first quarter due primarily to the impact of the continuing low interest-rate environment, as well as compression in LIBOR spreads. Net interest margin, including the discount accretion, was 234 basis points in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 201 basis points in the first quarter of 2009. Operating-basis net interest margin was 162 basis points in the first quarter of 2010.
In the quarter, we recorded $192million of net gains from sales of securities, partially offset by $97million of other-than-temporary impairment, resulting in $95 million of net gains related to investment securities. In addition, we recorded a $15 million provision for loan losses, primarily related to commercial real estate exposures
.
Operating-basis expenses in the first quarter of 2010 increased 22% compared to the year-ago quarter due to increases in salaries and benefits expenses as well as other expenses. Salaries and benefits expenses increased to $883 million, or 21%, because in the first quarter of 2009, we did not accrue discretionary cash incentive compensation in order to support our TCE improvement plan. Other expenses increased 71% to $245 million due to an unusually low level of these expenses in the first quarter of 2009. Transaction processing expense of $153 million increased 17% attributable to higher volumes in the investment servicing business, and information systems and communications expense increased 4% to $167 million. Occupancy expense decreased 2% to $118 million.
The effective tax rate on first-quarter 2010 GAAP earnings was 29.5%, compared to 22.5% in the first quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the first quarter of 2010 was 26.2%, up from 22.7% on the same basis for the first quarter of 2009. The increase in the effective tax rate on GAAP and operating-basis earnings is due to the non-recurrence of certain reductions in prior-period tax accruals recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the full year 2010 is expected to be between 28% and 29%.
FIRST-QUARTER 2010 RESULTS VS. FOURTH QUARTER 2009
The following information is presented on an operating basis. Earnings per common share in the first quarter of 2010 were $0.75 up 6% from $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total revenue in the first quarter of $2.116 billion was up 1.6% compared with fourth-quarter revenue of $2.082 billion. Total expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.566 billion, up 0.6% compared with $1.556 in the fourth quarter. As a result, we achieved 100 basis points of positive operating leverage comparing the results of the first quarter of 2010 with those of the fourth quarter of 2009. Return on common shareholders equity of 10.0% compares with 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis revenue:
Servicing fees were $880 million, down slightly from $882 million in the fourth quarter due primarily to a stronger US dollar and lower volumes, partially offset by new business and the impact of higher average equity markets. Management fees were $226 million down 2% from $231 million primarily due to lower performance fees in the first quarter of 2010. Trading services revenue was $242 million, compared to $270 million due to lower brokerage and other revenue as well as lower volumes and lower volatility in foreign exchange services. Securities finance revenue was $72 million, down 13% from $83 million in the prior quarter primarily due to compressed spreads, partially offset by slightly increased volumes. Processing fees and other revenue increased from $60 million to $120 million due primarily to a gain from an early buyout of a legacy leasing transaction. Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $729 million, and included a tax-equivalent adjustment of $32 million and discount accretion of $230 million. On an operating basis, excluding accretion, net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2010 was $481 million, down 4% from $499 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the reinvestment of the investment portfolio at lower rates.
The table below provides the components of operating-basis expenses for the indicated periods:
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, salaries and employee benefits expense increased 12% to $883 million from $791 million primarily due to a higher level of incentive compensation accruals recorded in the first quarter and increased benefit costs. Other expenses declined 26% to $245 million. Other expenses in the fourth quarter included a previously disclosed legal settlement.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on common shareholders equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders equity for the period. Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
This news release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A full reconciliation of operating-basis results to GAAP results is included in the addendum at the end of this news release.
Management believes that the use of other non-GAAP financial measures in the calculation of capital ratios is useful to understanding State Streets capital position and of interest to investors. Below is a description of, and other information with respect to, the capital ratios referenced in this news release.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements and, as permitted, exclude the impact of commercial paper purchased under the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostons AMLF.
The tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. Management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this news release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to unaudited tier 1 common capital as of March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, and March 31, 2009 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
, is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF and cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE ratio as of March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, and March 31, 2009 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by total risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). As permitted by bank regulations, total risk-weighted assets exclude commercial paper purchased under the AMLF. The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the unaudited TCE/RWA ratio as of March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, and March 31, 2009 are included in the addendum at the end of this news release.

14 Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
15 Investment Portfolio  Appendix INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below. SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.
16 Investment Portfolio - Appendix Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006. Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%. Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis. Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with that used by rating agencies Spanish MBS: 3.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate Italian MBS: 1.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate Russian MBS: 8.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Russian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate Greek MBS: 1.0% Used an additional 2-3x stress to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure, which was 0.7% Portuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Portuguese RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rate CLOs:  Based on an industry projection of 12% spec. grade default rate with half of the long-term recovery rate on senior secured bank loans of 70%. The average recovery rate of 70% is from data covering issues from 1982-2005.
17 Investment Portfolio - Appendix Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss. HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates. Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee. Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS:  Based on the worst historical cumulative loss ever experienced by any one CMBS securitized deal.
18 Investment Portfolio - Appendix  HCLHistorical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.Avg. CECredit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination.CoverageCoverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
