Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports 2010 Earnings Per Share
of $3.09 on $9.0 Billion in Revenue
Operating-Basis Earnings Per Share of $3.40 Increased 2% from $3.32
in 2009
Operating-Basis Revenue Increased 7% from 2009 Driven Primarily by Increase in Servicing Fee Revenue
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 19, 2011--State Street Corporation today announced full-year and fourth-quarter 2010 earnings per common share of $3.09 and $0.16, compared to $3.46 and $1.00 for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively. Fourth-quarter earnings per share include the impact of certain actions taken to accelerate growth and to provide greater capital flexibility. These actions resulted in a loss of $0.67 per share resulting from a repositioning of the investment portfolio and a restructuring charge associated with a reduction in force and real estate consolidation of $0.21 per share. The full-year 2009 results are presented, and comparisons are made, before an extraordinary after-tax loss of $7.77 per share associated with the consolidation of the Companys asset-backed commercial paper conduits onto its balance sheet. Revenue in 2010 was $8.953 billion, an increase of 4% from $8.640 billion in 2009 and was $2.043 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, down 10% from $2.280 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Expenses of $6.842 billion in 2010 increased 15% from $5.966 billion in 2009, primarily due to a $414 million pre-tax securities finance charge recorded in the second quarter of 2010 and the fourth-quarter restructuring charge of $156 million, as well as merger and integrationcosts of $89 million, primarily associated with the acquisitions of Intesa Sanpaolos Securities Servicing business (Intesa) and Mourant International Finance Administration (Mourant). In the fourth quarter of 2010, expenses were $1.792 billion, including the above restructuring charge and merger and integration costs of $12 million primarily associated with the acquisitions, compared to $1.565 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Return on shareholders equity was 9.5% in 2010, down from 13.2% in 2009 and was 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 14.0% in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Compared to the third quarter of 2010, fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share decreased 85% from $1.08 per share, primarily due to the loss associated with the investment portfolio repositioning and the restructuring charge, and revenue declined 12% from $2.310 billion, also primarily due to the loss associated with the investment portfolio repositioning. Expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were $1.527 billion. For the third quarter of 2010, return on shareholders equity was 12.9%.
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on an operating basis in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. Reconciliations of GAAP-basis results to operating-basis results are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release. Also see Additional Information. Operating-basis net interest revenue for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes discount accretion related to former conduit assets.
Operating-basis earnings per share in 2010 were $3.40 compared to $3.32 in 2009. Operating-basis revenue in 2010 was $8.714 billion, up 7.1% from $8.138 billion in 2009. Operating-basis expenses increased to $6.176 billion, up 9.0% from 2009. On an operating basis, return on shareholders equity was 10.4% in 2010 compared to 12.6% in 2009. Comparing 2010 with 2009, negative operating leverage of 190 basis points was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense in 2009, reflecting the implementation of the Tangible Common Equity (TCE) improvement plan.
Operating-basis earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $0.87 compared to $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $0.86 in the third quarter of 2010. Operating-basis revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $2.281 billion, an increase of 9.6% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 5.9% from $2.154 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Operating-basis expenses in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $1.624 billion, an increase of 4.4% from the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 7.0% from $1.518 billion in the third quarter of 2010. On an operating basis, comparing the fourth quarter of 2010 with the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company achieved 520 basis points of positive operating leverage. On an operating basis, return on shareholders equity was 9.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 10.2% in the third quarter of 2010.
Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's chairman and chief executive officer, said, In the fourth quarter, we continued to experience favorable growth in servicing and management fees, and in addition, we saw some improvement in trading services revenue compared to the third quarter. We also maintained control over expenses, and on an operating basis in the fourth quarter we achieved 520 basis points of positive operating leverage compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Commenting on the fourth-quarter actions the Company undertook, he said, During the quarter, we took significant actions that we expect to positively impact State Streets results in the coming years. First, we announced a multi-year plan to transform our operating model, including a comprehensive technology program, designed to increase efficiencies and position the Company for accelerated growth. Second, we repositioned our investment portfolio to provide greater flexibility for capital deployment in the future. Our capital levels are strong, significantly in excess of the current regulatory well capitalized requirements; and we are well positioned for the implementation of Basel III capital requirements as we understand them, far ahead of their required implementation dates.
He continued, In 2010 we won mandates for $1.4 trillion in assets to be serviced, $390 billion of which are scheduled for installation in 2011. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) continues to benefit from growth in passive and ETF assets. In 2010 SSgA added about $160 billion in gross new assets, $40 billion of which are to be installed in 2011. In January 2011, we closed the acquisition of Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), which expands SSgAs offerings, particularly in active fundamental management. The acquisitions of the Intesa and Mourant businesses were modestly accretive in 2010, and the integrations continue to progress well and are on track to meet the outlook we previously provided. We achieved a full-year operating-basis net interest margin of 168 basis points, which excludes discount accretion.
Hooley concluded, While near-term we expect increased regulatory costs, as well as lower net interest revenue in 2011 due to pressure from the low interest-rate environment and the impact of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, we are well positioned to take advantage of global growth opportunities and, as the economy normalizes, we remain committed to our long-term financial goals.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations applicable to the tier 1 common and TCE ratios.
Total assets were $161 billion at December 31, 2010, including $16.6 billion in excess deposits held primarily at the Federal Reserve and at other central banks. The average balance sheet for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $160 billion, compared to $154 billion for the third quarter of 2010 and $146 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of December 31, 2010, with the Companys total capital ratio at 22.0%, its tier 1 capital ratio at 20.5% and its leverage ratio at 8.2%. In addition, at that date, the Companys tier 1 common ratio was 18.1%, its TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio was 17.2%, and its TCE ratio was 7.6%. Ratios adjusted for the effects of the applicable methodologies provided for in the Basel III capital requirements are: total capital ratio of 11.6%, tier 1 capital ratio of 10.6%, tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.9%, and tier 1 common ratio of 9.4%. These ratios reflect State Streets estimates of the impact of the requirements under Basel III affecting capital, based upon published statements of the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve. See Additional Information below for information concerning the specified capital ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations of these ratios to ratios calculated under presently applicable requirements.
At December 31, 2010, the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio were $504 million, up from $281 million at September 30, 2010 primarily due to the steepening of the yield curve in the second half of the fourth quarter, and down from $2.29 billion as of December 31, 2009, primarily due to significant spread compression.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, GAAP results included discount accretion of $139 million, or $0.17 per share, related to the former conduit assets. As of December 31, 2010, the Company expects a pre-tax aggregate of about $1.3 billion to accrete into interest revenue over the remaining lives of the former conduit assets, of which it expects approximately $200 million to accrete in 2011. These expectations are based on many assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated pre-payment speeds, credit quality, and sales.
The following tables provide the components of operating-basis revenue and operating-basis expenses for the noted periods:
FOURTH-QUARTER 2010 RESULTS VS. THE FOURTH QUARTER of 2009
Servicing fees were up 19% to $1.064 billion from $895 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase was attributable primarily to the impact of the acquisition of Intesa and Mourant, new business, and increases in daily average equity valuations. Total assets under custody and administration were $21.527 trillion at December 31, 2010, up 15% compared with $18.795 trillion at December 31, 2009. Daily average values for the S & P 500 Index were up 11% and the MSCI EAFE Index increased approximately 3% from the fourth quarter of 2009.
ES
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $221 million, up 1% from $218 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in management fees was attributable primarily to increases in the average of month-end valuations in worldwide equity markets and new business. Average month-end equity valuations increased about 12% and 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index,respectively. Total assets under management at December 31, 2010, were $2.010 trillion, up 3% compared to $1.951 trillion at December 31, 2009.
ES
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was $310 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of 15% from $270 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Foreign exchange revenue increased 19% primarily due to changes in product mix offset slightly by lower volatility and volumes. Brokerage and other fees were up about 10% due primarily to an increase in electronic trading.
Securities finance revenue was $69 million in the quarter, down 17% from $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to both compressed spreads and lower volumes. Processing fees and other revenue was $71 million, up from $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Net interest revenue on a fully-taxable equivalent basis, which includes discount accretion, was $689 million. On an operating basis, which excludes discount accretion, net interest revenue was $550 million, an increase of 10% from $499 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to a modest improvement in funding costs and the impact of deposits added in connection with the Intesa acquisition Fully taxable-equivalent net interest margin, including the discount accretion, was 207 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 235 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating-basis net interest margin was 165 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to 161 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009.
.
In the fourth quarter of 2010, on an operating basis, we recorded $3 million of net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities. Separately, we recorded $(7)million of other-than-temporary impairment, resulting in $4 million of net losses related to investment securities. As previously announced, during the fourth quarter, State Street sold investment securities of approximately $11 billion in order to increase its balance sheet flexibility in deploying capital, to enhance its capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards, and to reduce its exposure to certain asset classes.
Operating-basis expenses of $1.624 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 4% compared to $1.556 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expenses and information systems and communications, offset partially by a lower level of other expenses. Salaries and benefits expenses increased 18% to $935 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation and the impact of the acquisitions. Information systems and communications expenses were $191 million, an increase of 17% from $163 million due primarily to the impact of the two acquisitions. Transaction processing services expenses were up 8% to $171 million due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business, including the impact of the two acquisitions. Occupancy expenses increased to $117 million from $115 million. Other expenses decreased 36% to $210 million due to lower securities processing costs, the impact of an adverse judgment of $60 million rendered by a Netherlands court in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the impact of a $40 million insurance recovery in the fourth quarter of 2010, offset partially by increased expenses associated with the two acquisitions.
The effective tax rate on fourth-quarter 2010 GAAP-basis earnings was 67.2%, compared to 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009 due primarily to the partial write-off of a deferred tax asset associated with certain of the investment securities sold in the investment portfolio repositioning transaction. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 and for the full year 2010 was 29.5% and 28.3% respectively, in line with our previously disclosed outlook. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the full year 2011 is expected to be between 28% and 29%.
FOURTH-QUARTER 2010 RESULTS VS. THIRD QUARTER 2010
Servicing fees were $1.064 billion, up 6% from $1.006 billion in the third quarter due primarily to new business installed and higher average equity valuations. Daily average values as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index increased 10%. Management fees were $221 million, up 13% from $196 million, due primarily to the higher average month-end equity market valuations as well as new business. Average month-end equity valuations were up 10% as measured by the S & P 500 and increased 8% as measured by the MSCI EAFE index. Trading services revenue was $310 million, up 36% compared to $228 million due to higher volatility and higher volumes in foreign exchange as well as higher fees primarily from transition management in brokerage and other fees. Securities finance revenue was $69 million, up slightly from $68 million in the third quarter Processing fees and other revenue was flat at $71 million. Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $689 million, including discount accretion. On an operating basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $550 million, down from $568 million due to the impact of the repositioning of the investment portfolio.

.
Compared to the third quarter of 2010, salaries and benefits expense increased 7% to $935 million from $871 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation and fees for contract services. Information systems and communications expense was $191 million, up 6% due primarily to higher global infrastructure costs. Other expenses were $210 million, up 11%, due to miscellaneous expenses, including donations, travel expenses, professional fees and sale and promotion costs.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on common shareholders equity is determined by dividing full-year or annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders equity for the period. Operating-basis return on common equity utilizes full-year or annualized operating-basis net income in the calculation. Positive operating leverage is defined as the excess rate of growth of total revenue over the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Operating-basis financial information is a non-GAAP presentation. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This news release also includes capital ratios in addition to, or adjusted from, those calculated in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. These include capital ratios based on tier 1 common capital and capital ratios adjusted to reflect our estimate of the application of the Basel III capital requirements. These non-regulatory and adjusted capital measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Management presently evaluates the non-GAAP capital ratios presented in this news release to aid in its understanding of State Streets capital position under a variety of standards, including presently applicable and evolving regulatory requirements. Management believes that the use of the non-GAAP capital ratios described in this news release similarly aids in an investor's understanding of State Street's capital position and therefore is of interest to investors.
In addition to the reconciliations described in the descriptions below of the capital ratios referenced in this news release, the addendum to this news release also includes reconciliations of the following other non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this news release: operating-basis results to GAAP-basis results and Basel III-adjusted capital ratios to capital ratios calculated under presently applicable requirements.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and capital ratios determined in accordance with presently applicable regulatory requirements.
Capital Ratios
The total capital, the tier 1 capital, and the tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 common ratio is sometimes used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its supervisory capital assessment programs. The TCE and TCE/risk-weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements.
The total capital, the tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. Management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this news release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to tier 1 common capital as of December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
, is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE ratio as of December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by total risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE/RWA ratio as of December 31, 2010, September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, are included in the addendum at the end of this news release.
The ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, or TCE/RWA ratio,

11 Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
12  Investment Portfolio - Appendix  The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.  We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).  As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below.  SFL  Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below.  INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
13  Investment Portfolio - Appendix  Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006.  Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%.  Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle.  Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This calculation is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis.  Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch performance, which in recent years has been 0.05% per annum UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages, using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with what we understand rating agencies use Spanish MBS: 3.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically  conservative recovery rate Italian MBS: 3.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate Russian MBS: 8.0% Used a 4x multiple to the worst performing Russian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate Greek MBS: 1.5% Used an additional 2x stress to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure, Portuguese MBS: 5.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Portuguese RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a    historically conservative recovery rate  CLOs:  Based on Moodys average issuer-weighted default rate of 4% for B2-rated issuers during 1983-2009 period over assumed WAL of 4 years with 60% loss severity.  According to Moodys, the highest loss severity rate on 1st lien loans in the 1990-2009 period was 46.6% in 1993.
 
14  Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss.  HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.  Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee.  Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption.   Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption.   CMBS:  Calculated by applying the highest cumulative loss experienced by any cohort vintage (1986) over the time period 1972-2002 as reported in Commercial Mortgage Defaults: 30 Years of History by Howard Esaki and Masumi Goldman, as it appeared in the Winter 2005 issue of CMBS World magazine. Investment Portfolio - Appendix
15  Investment Portfolio - Appendix   HCL  Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.  Avg. CE  Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination.  Coverage  Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple.  Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.  For subprime, non-agency prime MBS, and Alt-A, coverage is calculated by dividing the break even loss value by SFL.  The break even loss is calculated by a third party provider.  It represents  the loss value a bond can withstand before experiencing a principal loss after giving benefit to all credit enhancement, both structural and excess spread, as well as any discount to the carrying value of the bond (eg. due to purchase discount or impairment).   As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
