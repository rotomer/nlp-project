State Street Corporation is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to its Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2011 (filed with the SEC on May 24, 2011) solely for the purpose of disclosing under Item 5.07 of Form 8-K its decision, following its annual meeting of shareholders, as to the frequency with which it expects to include a shareholder vote on the compensation of executives in future annual meeting proxy materials. This Amendment No. 1 does not otherwise revise the May 18, 2011 Form 8-K in any way.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At State Street Corporation's annual meeting of shareholders held on May 18, 2011, State Street's shareholders voted on an advisory proposal concerning the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. As reported in State Street's Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 18, 2011, at the meeting, consistent with the Board of Directors' recommendation, shareholders cast the highest number of votes for an annual frequency instead of a biennial (every two years) or triennial (every three years) frequency. In light of this vote and other factors, the Board of Directors has determined that State Street will hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. State Street will re-evaluate this determination in connection with its next shareholder advisory vote regarding the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
