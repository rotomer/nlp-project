State Street Reports EPS of $1.00 on $2.5 Billion in Revenue
for Second Quarter of 2011
On an Operating Basis EPS Increased 9% to $0.96 from $0.88 in First Quarter of 2011 with a 6% Increase in Revenue
On an Operating Basis, State Street Achieved 170 Basis Points of Positive Operating Leverage Compared to the First Quarter of 2011
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2011--State Street Corporation today announced second-quarter 2011 earnings per common share of $1.00, compared to $0.87 in the second quarter of 2010. Revenue of $2.491 billion increased 8% from $2.304 billion in the second quarter of 2010 and expenses were $1.774 billion, down 9% from $1.944 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Second-quarter 2011 revenue included $51 million, or $0.06 per share, of net interest revenue associated with discount accretion related to asset-backed commercial paper conduit securities consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet in 2009. Second-quarter 2011 expenses included $17 million, or $0.02 per share, attributable to acquisition and restructuring costs. Return on average common shareholders equity was 10.6% in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 11.0% in the second quarter of 2010.
Second-quarter 2010 results included revenue of $172 million, or $0.21 per share, associated with conduit-related discount accretion and a pre-tax charge of $414 million, or $0.50 per share, related to the securities lending programs, including certain common and collective trust funds managed by State Street Global Advisors; $41 million, or $0.05 per share, of acquisition and restructuring costs; a tax of $21 million, or $0.03 per share, on bonus payments to employees in the United Kingdom; and a tax benefit of $180 million, or $0.31 per share, related to the restructuring of former non-U.S. conduit assets.
In the first quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per share of $0.93 on revenue of $2.361 billion. Expenses in the first quarter of 2011 were $1.702 billion. First-quarter 2011 revenue included $62 million, or $0.08 per share, of conduit-related discount accretion. Expenses included acquisition and restructuring costs of $19 million, or $0.03 per share. Return on average common shareholders equity was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2011.
NON-GAAP BASIS
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on a non-GAAP basis, to which management refers as operating basis, in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. Reconciliations of operating-basis results to GAAP-basis results are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release. Also see Additional Information. Operating-basis net interest revenue for all periods is presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes discount accretion related to former conduit securities.
Operating-basis earnings per share in the second quarter of 2011 were $0.96 compared to $0.93 in the second quarter of 2010. Operating-basis revenue in the second quarter of 2011 was $2.473 billion, up 14.3% from $2.163 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Operating-basis expenses increased to $1.757 billion, up 19.7% from $1.468 billion in the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2010, management reduced incentive compensation expense as a result of the securities finance-related charge. On an operating basis, comparing the second quarter of 2011 with the second quarter of 2010, negative operating leverage was 540 basis points. On an operating basis, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.2% in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.8% in the second quarter of 2010.
Operating-basis earnings per share in the second quarter of 2011 were up 9.1% from $0.88 per share in the first quarter of 2011; revenue on the same basis and in the same comparison was up 6.1% from $2.330 billion; and expenses on the same basis and in the same comparison were up 4.4% from $1.683 billion. On an operating basis, comparing the second quarter of 2011 with the first quarter of 2011, positive operating leverage was 170 basis points. On an operating basis, return on average common shareholders equity was 10.2% compared to 9.9% in the first quarter of 2011.
Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, In the second quarter we achieved strong growth in fee revenue due to continued momentum in servicing and management fee revenues driven by global client demand, and supported by seasonal factors affecting securities finance. We achieved positive operating leverage on an operating basis, comparing this years second quarter with the first quarter, based on our continuing efforts to manage expenses.
Hooley continued, Our capital remains strong, and following the Federal Reserves review of our comprehensive capital plan earlier this year, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share, and we initiated our share purchase program, buying approximately 4.9 million of our common shares during the second quarter. As we have emphasized for the past several quarters, based upon our understanding of the proposed rules, we currently exceed the capital ratios required under the Basel III proposal.
Looking ahead, Hooley noted, We are pleased with our strong performance in the first half of the year. In addition to the usual seasonal weakness in third-quarter trading revenue, we face short-term challenges posed by the slower recovery and low interest-rate environment in the U.S., the uncertainty in Europe, and increased regulatory and compliance costs. We are addressing these challenges by remaining focused on controlling expenses, enhancing our risk management, and executing on our business operations and IT transformation program, which is progressing well and performing on track with the expectations we announced last November.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations applicable to the tier 1 common and TCE ratios.
(1) Presented on an operating basis, a non-GAAP presentation.
(2) Includes assets under custody of $16,789 billion, $16,692 billion, and $13,999 billion, respectively, as of period end Q2 2011, Q1 2011, and Q2 2010.
Total assets were $190.5 billion and $171.8 billion and included $22.1 billion and $13.3 billion of excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011, respectively. The average balance sheet for the second quarter of 2011 was $164 billion, compared to $159 billion for the first quarter of 2011 and $151 billion for the second quarter of 2010. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of June 30, 2011, with the Companys total capital ratio at 20.7%, its tier 1 capital ratio at 18.9% and its tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.6%. In addition, at that date, the Companys tier 1 common ratio was 16.8%, its TCE ratio was 7.3%, and its TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio was 16.6%. June 30, 2011 ratios adjusted for the effects of the applicable methodologies provided for in the Basel III capital requirements are: total capital ratio of 14.6%, tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9%, tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.3%, and tier 1 common ratio of 11.8%. These ratios reflect State Streets estimates of the impact of the requirements under Basel III affecting capital, based upon published statements of the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve. See Additional Information below for information concerning the specified capital ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations of these ratios to ratios calculated under presently applicable requirements.
At June 30, 2011, the net after-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio were $94 million, improved from net unrealized mark-to-market losses of $352 million at March 31, 2011, primarily due to the decline in interest rates, offset partially by a modest widening in spreads and $994 million as of June 30, 2010, primarily due to tighter spreads.
As of June 30, 2011, the Company expects to record aggregate pre-tax conduit-related accretion of about $1.25 billion in interest revenue over the remaining terms of the former conduit securities, of which it expects to record approximately $200 million in 2011. These expectations are based on many assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated pre-payment speeds, credit quality and sales.
The following tables provide the components of operating-basis revenue and operating-basis expenses for the periods noted:
(1) Operating-basis information for the second and first quarters of 2011, and the second quarter of 2010, included $33 million, $31 million, and $31 million, respectively, of tax-equivalent adjustments, and excluded $51 million, $62 million, and $172 million, respectively, of conduit-related discount accretion. GAAP-basis net interest revenue for these periods was $572 million, $577 million, and $658 million, respectively.

SECOND-QUARTER 2011 RESULTS VS. SECOND QUARTER 2010
Servicing fees were up 16% to $1.124 billion from $973 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase was attributable primarily to net new business installed, the impact of the May 2010 acquisition of Intesas Securities Servicing business, and increases in daily average equity valuations. Total assets under custody and administration were $22.762 trillion at June 30, 2011, up 19.6% compared with $19.032 trillion at June 30, 2010. Daily average values for the S & P 500 Index and the MSCI EAFE Indexwere up approximately 16% and 17%, respectively, from the second quarter of 2010.
ES
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $250 million, up 24% from $201 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in management fees was attributable primarily to increases in the average of month-end valuations in worldwide equity markets and the impact of the January 2011 acquisition of the Bank of Ireland asset management business. Total assets under management at June 30, 2011, were $2.116 trillion, up 15% compared to $1.835 trillion at June 30, 2010. Average month-end equity valuations increased about 22% and 23% compared to the second quarter of 2010 as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index, respectively.
ES
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was $311 million for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of 5% from $326 million in the second quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange trading revenue decreased 9% primarily due to lower volatility, offset partially by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fees were up slightly.
Securities finance revenue was $137 million in the quarter, up 26% from $109 million in the second quarter of 2010 due primarily to improved spreads in the seasonally strong second quarter, partially offset by lower volumes. Processing fees and other revenue was $70 million, down from $87 million primarily due to lower revenue from joint ventures and structured products.
Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which includes conduit-related discount accretion, was $605 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $689 million in the second quarter of 2010. On an operating basis, which excludes discount accretion, net interest revenue was $554 million, an increase of 7% from $517 million in the second quarter of 2010 primarily due to an improvement in rates from the ECB and growth in customer deposits, including the deposits added in connection with the Intesa acquisition Fully taxable-equivalent net interest margin, including the discount accretion, was 176 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 221 basis points in the second quarter of 2010. Operating-basis net interest margin was 161 basis points in the second quarter of 2011, compared to 166 basis points in the second quarter of 2010.
.
In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $62 million of net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities. Separately, we recorded $35million of other-than-temporary impairment, resulting in $27 million of net gains related to investment securities.
Operating-basis expenses of $1.757 billion in the second quarter of 2011 increased 20% compared to $1.468 billion in the second quarter of 2010 primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expenses. Salaries and benefits expenses increased 22% from $828 million to $1.009 billion, primarily due to the impact of the reduction in incentive compensation in the second quarter of 2010 related to the securities finance charge. In addition, the second quarter of 2011 included merit increases, the ongoing impact of the three acquisitions, and contract employee costs associated with the business operations and IT transformation program. Information systems and communications expenses were $199 million, an increase of 14% from $174 million due primarily to the impact of acquisitions. Transaction processing services expenses were up 18% to $193 million from $164 million due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses decreased to $113 million from $116 million. Other expenses increased 31%, or $57 million, to $243 million, primarily as a result of the impact of an insurance recovery in the second quarter of 2010 as well as the impact of acquisitions in the second quarter of 2011.
The effective tax rate on second-quarter 2011 GAAP-basis earnings was 28.2%, compared to (23.4)% in the second quarter of 2010, with the 2010 rate due to the benefit from the restructuring of former non-US conduit assets recorded in the second quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the second quarter of 2011 was 27.5%, consistent with our previously disclosed annual outlook. Our effective tax rate on operating basis earnings for the full year 2011 is expected to be slightly below 28%.
SECOND-QUARTER 2011 RESULTS VS. THE FIRST QUARTER 2011
Servicing fees were $1.124 billion, up 3% from $1.095 billion in the first quarter due primarily to net new business installed and slightly higher average equity valuations. Daily average values as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE index each increased about 1%. Management fees were $250 million, up 6% from $236 million, due primarily to net new business installed and slightly higher average month-end equity valuations. Average month-end equity valuations for the S & P 500 and MSCI EAFE index were each up about 2%. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other fees, was $311 million, up 3% compared to $302 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue increased 6% due to higher volumes as well as slightly higher volatility in foreign exchange. Brokerage and other fee revenue was $142 million, flat with the first quarter. Securities finance revenue was $137 million, up 108% from $66 million primarily due to seasonality Processing fees and other revenue was down 24% to $70 million due to lower revenues from joint ventures and structured products.

Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the second quarter of 2011 totaled $605 million, including discount accretion, compared to $608 million in the first quarter. On an operating basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the second quarter of 2011 was $554 million, up from $546 million due primarily to an increase in customer deposits and lower funding costs.
Compared to the first quarter of 2011, salaries and benefits expense increased 4% to $1.009 billion from $974 million, primarily due to the impact of merit increases and higher contract employee costs associated with the business operations and IT transformation program. Information systems and communications expense was $199 million, up from $191 million in the first quarter of 2011. Transaction processing expense was $193 million, up 7% from $180 million primarily due to increased volumes in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expense increased 6% to $113 million from $107 million. Other expenses were $243 million up 5% from $231 million primarily due to increased regulatory costs.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on average common shareholders equity is determined by dividing full-year or annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders equity for the period. Operating-basis return on average common equity utilizes full-year or annualized operating-basis net income available to common equity in the calculation. Operating leverage is defined as the rate of growth of total revenue less the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Operating-basis financial information is a non-GAAP presentation. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
This news release also includes capital ratios in addition to, or adjusted from, those calculated in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. These include capital ratios based on tier 1 common capital and tangible common equity as well as capital ratios adjusted to reflect our estimate of the impact of the Basel III capital requirements. These non-regulatory and adjusted capital measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Management presently evaluates the non-GAAP capital ratios presented in this news release to aid in its understanding of State Streets capital position under a variety of standards, including presently applicable and evolving regulatory requirements. Management believes that the use of the non-GAAP capital ratios described in this news release similarly aids in an investor's understanding of State Street's capital position and therefore is of interest to investors.
In addition to the reconciliations, described below, of the capital ratios referenced in this news release, the addendum to this news release also includes reconciliations of the following other non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this news release: operating-basis results to GAAP-basis results and Basel III-adjusted capital ratios to capital ratios calculated under presently applicable requirements.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and capital ratios determined in accordance with presently applicable regulatory requirements.
Capital Ratios
The total capital, tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 common ratio is sometimes used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its capital assessment and review programs. The TCE and TCE/risk-weighted assets ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements.
The total capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. Management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this news release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to tier 1 common capital as of June 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.
The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio
, is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE ratio as of June 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release
The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by total risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE/RWA ratio as of June 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.

adverse publicity or other reputational harm;
our ability to grow revenue, attract and/or retain and compensate highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements;
the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk;
changes in accounting standards and practices; and
changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due.
Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings.

Investment Portfolio APPENDIX
Investment Portfolio  Appendix The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month. We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below. SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below. INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006. Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%. Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle. Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This calculation is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis. Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposure Australian MBS: 0.0% No losses expected, given 100% lenders mortgage insurance coverage on the underlying mortgages Dutch MBS: 0.5% Based on historical Dutch loss performance, which in recent years has been around 0.05% UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages (1987  1991), using historical severities UK Non-conforming: 7.5% No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with what we understand rating agencies use Spanish MBS: 3.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate Italian MBS: 3.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically   conservative recovery rate Greek MBS: 5.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure plus an   additional buffer to account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery rate Portuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 2x multiple to the second worst performing Portuguese RMBS vintage for cumulative defaults plus an   additional buffer to account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery rate Irish MBS: 5.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Irish RMBS vintage for cumulative defaults plus an additional buffer to   account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery rate
CLOs:  Based on Moodys average issuer-weighted default rate of 4% for B2-rated issuers during 1983-2009 period over assumed WAL of 4 years with 60% loss severity.  According to Moodys, the highest loss severity rate on 1st lien loans in the 1990-2009 period was 46.6% in 1993. Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss. HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates. Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee.Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current Loan to Value (LTV) and a future negative Home Price Appreciation (HPA) assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS:  Calculated by applying the highest cumulative loss experienced by any cohort vintage (1986) over the time period 1972-2002 as reported in Commercial Mortgage Defaults: 30 Years of History by Howard Esaki and Masumi Goldman, as it appeared in the Winter 2005 issue of CMBS World magazine. Investment Portfolio  Appendix
Investment Portfolio - Appendix  HCL Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers.Avg. CE Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination. Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple.  Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.  For subprime, non-agency prime MBS, and Alt-A, coverage is calculated by dividing the break even loss value by SFL.  The break even loss is calculated by a third party provider.  It represents  the loss value a bond can withstand before experiencing a principal loss after giving benefit to all credit enhancement, both structural and excess spread, as well as any discount to the carrying value of the bond (eg. due to purchase discount or impairment).  As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.
