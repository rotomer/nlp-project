EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports EPS of $1.10 for the Third Quarter of 2011 up 10% Compared to the Second Quarter of 2011
Operating Basis EPS of $0.96 Equal to the Second Quarter of 2011
Achieved Positive Operating Leverage Compared to Second Quarter of 2011 on an Operating Basis
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 18, 2011--State Street Corporation today announced third-quarter 2011 earnings per common share of $1.10, compared to $1.08 in the third quarter of 2010. Revenue of $2.427 billion in the third quarter of 2011 increased 5% from $2.310 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and expenses were $1.798 billion, up 18% from $1.527 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Third-quarter 2011 revenue included net interest revenue of $46 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with discount accretion related to former conduit securities consolidated onto the Companys balance sheet in 2009. Third-quarter 2011 results also included a discrete tax benefit of $91 million, or $0.18 per share, related to a restructuring of former non-U.S. conduit assets and $85 million, or $0.10 per share, attributable to acquisition and restructuring costs. Third-quarter 2010 results included net interest revenue of $189 million, or $0.23 per share, associated with conduit-related discount accretion and acquisition and restructuring costs of $23 million, or $0.03 per share. Return on average common shareholders equity was 11.2% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 12.9% in the third quarter of 2010.
In the second quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per common share of $1.00 on revenue of $2.491 billion. Expenses in the second quarter of 2011 were $1.774 billion. Second-quarter 2011 revenue included net interest revenue of $51 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with conduit-related discount accretion. Expenses in that quarter included acquisition and restructuring costs of $17 million, or $0.02 per share. Return on average common shareholders equity was 10.6% in the second quarter of 2011.
NON-GAAP BASIS
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on a non-GAAP basis, to which management refers as operating basis, in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. Reconciliations of operating-basis results to GAAP-basis results are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release. Also see Additional Information.
Operating-basis earnings per common share in the third quarter of 2011 were $0.96 compared to $0.86 in the third quarter of 2010 and $0.96 in the second quarter of 2011. Operating-basis revenue in the third quarter of 2011 was $2.413 billion, up 12.0% from $2.154 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and down 2.4% from $2.473 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Operating-basis expenses increased to $1.713 billion, up 12.8% from $1.518 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and down 2.5% from $1.757 billion in the second quarter of 2011. On an operating basis, return on average common shareholders equity was 9.8% in the third quarter of 2011, down from 10.2% in both the third quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2011.
Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, Our third-quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model as our operating-basis revenues increased from last years third quarter by about 12%, supported by prior period new business wins as well as stronger foreign exchange revenue. On an operating basis, we achieved positive operating leverage compared to the second quarter, reflecting effective expense control and expense savings from the business operations and information technology transformation program we launched last November. Salaries and benefits expenses declined during the third quarter from the second quarter, as a result of reductions in incentive compensation and our success in executing this transformation program.
Hooley continued, In the third quarter we purchased approximately 5.8 million of our common shares which brought the total shares purchased in 2011 to 10.7 million, leaving about $225 million remaining to complete the previously announced share purchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in March. We ended the third quarter with a tier 1 common ratio of 16.0%. With our strong capital position, we believe we are well positioned as we formulate our 2012 capital plan to be submitted to the Federal Reserve early next year.
Hooley concluded, As we approach the end of 2011 and plan for 2012, we expect to face a prolonged, worldwide low interest-rate environment, constrained economic growth, anticipated higher capital requirements, and increased regulatory and compliance costs. We are addressing these challenges by remaining focused on our clients and growing our business, while controlling expenses with a goal of continuing to generate positive operating leverage.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating basis where noted. Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. See Additional Information for a further description of these ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations applicable to the operating-basis financial information and to the tier 1 common and TCE ratios.
Total assets were $208.2 billion and $190.5 billion and included $33.7 billion and $22.1 billion of excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks at September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011, respectively. The average balance sheet for the third quarter of 2011 was $181 billion, compared to $164 billion for the second quarter of 2011 and $154 billion for the third quarter of 2010. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of September 30, 2011, with the Companys total capital ratio at 19.6%, its tier 1 capital ratio at 18.0% and its tier 1 leverage ratio at 7.8%. In addition, at that date, the Companys tier 1 common ratio was 16.0%, its TCE ratio was 7.1%, and its TCE to risk-weighted assets ratio was 15.7%. September 30, 2011 ratios adjusted for the effects of the applicable methodologies provided for in the Basel III capital requirements are: total capital ratio of 14.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8%, tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.0%, and tier 1 common ratio of 11.7%. These ratios reflect State Streets estimates of the impact of the requirements under Basel III affecting capital, based upon published statements of the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve. See Additional Information below for information concerning the specified capital ratios and the addendum at the end of this news release for reconciliations of these ratios to ratios calculated under presently applicable requirements.
At September 30, 2011, the net after-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio were $259 million, an increase from net unrealized mark-to-market losses of $94 million at June 30, 2011, primarily due to a modest widening in spreads, offset partially by lower interest rates, but down from $281 million as of September 30, 2010, primarily due to lower rates.
The Company expects to record aggregate pre-tax conduit-related accretion of about $1.14 billion in interest revenue from September 30, 2011 through the remaining terms of the former conduit securities, of which it continues to expect to record approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and a total of approximately $200 million in 2011. These expectations are based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated pre-payment speeds, credit quality and sales.
The following tables provide the components of operating-basis revenue and operating-basis expenses for the periods noted:
Operating-basis information for the third and second quarters of 2011, and the third quarter of 2010, included $32 million, $33 million, and $33 million, respectively, of tax-equivalent adjustments, and excluded $46 million, $51 million, and $189 million, respectively, of conduit-related discount accretion. GAAP-basis net interest revenue for these periods was $578 million, $572 million, and $724 million, respectively.

THIRD-QUARTER 2011 RESULTS VS. THIRD QUARTER 2010
Servicing fees were up 10% to $1.106 billion from $1.006 billion in the third quarter of 2010. The increase was attributable primarily to net new business and the improvement in daily average equity valuations. Total assets under custody and administration were $21.510 trillion at September 30, 2011, up 6% compared with $20.226 trillion at September 30, 2010. Daily average values for the S & P 500 Index and the MSCI EAFE Indexwere up approximately 12% and 4%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2010.
ES
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $229 million, up 17% from $196 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase in management fees was attributable primarily to increases in the average of month-end valuations in worldwide equity markets, the 2011 acquisition of the Bank of Ireland asset management business, and net new business installed. Total assets under management at September 30, 2011, were $1.877 trillion, down 4% compared to $1.959 trillion at September 30, 2010 due to scheduled redemptions by the Department of the U.S. Treasury. Average month-end equity valuations increased about 11% and 3%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2010 as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE Index.
ES
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was $334 million for the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 46% from $228 million in the third quarter of 2010. Foreign exchange trading revenue increased 91% primarily due to higher volatility, as well as higher volumes. Brokerage and other fees were up about 7% due to stronger revenue from electronic trading.
Securities finance revenue was $85 million in the quarter, up 25% from $68 million in the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to improved spreads. Processing fees and other revenue was $90 million, up 27% from $71 million due to $22 million of gains related to real estate and certain leases.
Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which includes conduit-related discount accretion, was $610 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $757 million in the third quarter of 2010. On an operating basis, which excludes discount accretion, net interest revenue was $564 million, a decrease of 1% from $568 million in the third quarter of 2010 primarily due to lower yields on the investment portfolio, offset partially by growth in client deposits and lower funding costs Clients placed additional deposits with State Street during the third quarter of 2011, which we invested with central banks, the impact of which contributed to a lower net interest margin than we would otherwise have achieved. Including this unusually high level of deposits, the fully taxable-equivalent net interest margin, including the discount accretion, was 156 basis points in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 236 basis points in the third quarter of 2010. Operating-basis net interest margin, including the excess central bank deposits, was 144 basis points in the third quarter of 2011 and excluding the excess deposits was 157 basis points, compared to 177 basis points in the third quarter of 2010.
.
In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded $15 million of net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and, separately, $10 million of losses from other-than-temporary impairment, resulting in $5 million of net gains related to investment securities.
Operating-basis expenses of $1.713 billion in the third quarter of 2011 increased 13% compared to $1.518 billion in the third quarter of 2010 for several reasons, including an increase in salaries and benefits expenses. Salaries and benefits expenses increased 11% from $871 million to $965 million, primarily due to year-over-year salary adjustments and acquisitions, as well as about $13 million of expenses associated with non-recurring costs for staff supporting the business operations and information technology transformation program. Information systems and communications expenses were $191 million, an increase of 6% from $181 million due primarily to the impact of infrastructure improvements. Transaction processing services expenses were up 9% to $180 million from $165 million due to higher volumes in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses increased to $119 million from $112 million. Other expenses increased 37%, or $69 million, to $258 million, primarily as a result of the impact of a $50 million insurance recovery in the third quarter of 2010.
The effective tax rate on third-quarter 2011 GAAP-basis earnings was 11.7% due primarily to the benefit from a restructuring of former non-US. conduit assets, compared to 30.1% in the third quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the third quarter of 2011 was 27.0%, consistent with our previously disclosed annual outlook. Our effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the full year 2011 is expected to be between 27% and 28%.
THIRD-QUARTER 2011 RESULTS VS. THE SECOND QUARTER 2011
Servicing fees were $1.106 billion, down 2% from $1.124 billion in the second quarter due primarily to declines in daily average equity valuations, offset partially by net new business installed. Daily average values as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE Index decreased about 7% and 10%, respectively. Management fees were $229 million down 8% from $250 million, due primarily to lower average month-end equity valuations, offset partially by net new business installed. Average month-end equity valuations for the S & P 500 and MSCI EAFE Index were down about 10% and 13%, respectively. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other fees, was $334 million, up 7% from $311 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue of $204 million increased 21% due to higher volatility. Brokerage and other fee revenue was $130 million, down 8% from the second quarter due to lower revenue from transition management, offset partially by higher revenue from electronic trading. Securities finance revenue was $85 million, down 38% from $137 million, primarily due to seasonality in the second quarter Processing fees and other revenue was up 29% to $90 million due to $22 million of gains related to real estate and leases.

Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the third quarter of 2011 totaled $610 million, including discount accretion, compared to $605 million in the second quarter. On an operating basis, fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the third quarter of 2011 was $564 million, up 2% from $554 million due to an increase in earning assets driven by an increase in client deposits.
Compared to the second quarter of 2011, salaries and benefits expense decreased 4% to $965 million from $1.009 billion, due to reductions in incentive compensation and benefits achieved from the business operations and IT transformation program. Information systems and communications expense was $191 million, down 4% from $199 million. Transaction processing expense was $180 million down 7% from $193 million, primarily due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expense increased 5% to $119 million from $113 million. Other expenses were $258 million, up about 6% from the second quarter due to an increase in securities processing costs.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on average common shareholders equity is determined by dividing full-year or annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders equity for the period. Operating-basis return on average common equity utilizes full-year or annualized operating-basis net income available to common equity in the calculation. Operating leverage is defined as the rate of growth of total revenue less the rate of growth of total expenses, each determined on an operating basis.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This news release includes financial information presented on a GAAP basis as well as on an operating basis. Operating-basis financial information is a non-GAAP presentation. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP.
This news release also includes capital ratios in addition to, or adjusted from, those calculated in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. These include capital ratios based on tier 1 common risk-based capital and tangible common equity as well as capital ratios adjusted to reflect our estimate of the impact of the Basel III capital requirements. These non-regulatory and adjusted capital measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Management currently evaluates the non-GAAP capital ratios presented in this news release to aid in its understanding of State Streets capital position under a variety of standards, including presently applicable and evolving regulatory requirements. Management believes that the use of the non-GAAP capital ratios described in this news release similarly aids in an investor's understanding of State Street's capital position and therefore is of interest to investors.
In addition to the reconciliations, described below, of the capital ratios referenced in this news release, the addendum to this news release also includes reconciliations of the following other non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this news release: operating-basis results to GAAP-basis results and Basel III-adjusted capital ratios to capital ratios calculated under currently applicable requirements.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and capital ratios determined in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements.
Capital Ratios
The total capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, or tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios are capital ratios used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio is sometimes used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its capital assessment and review programs. The tangible common equity, or TCE, and TCE/risk-weighted assets, or RWA, ratios are other capital ratios management believes provide additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy.
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements.
The total capital, tier 1 capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios
is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. Management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this news release, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to the tier 1 common ratios as of September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.
The tier 1 common ratio
is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE ratio as of September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release
The TCE ratio
.
is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity (reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes) by total risk-weighted assets (determined in accordance with applicable bank regulatory requirements). The TCE/RWA ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE/RWA ratio, our TCE/RWA ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE/RWA ratio as of September 30, 2011, June 30, 2011, and September 30, 2010 are provided in the addendum at the end of this news release.

(1) Actual (unaudited) total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios were calculated in accordance with currently applicable bank regulatory requirements. Tier 1 common ratio was calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities (tier 1 common capital), by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which were calculated in accordance with currently applicable bank regulatory requirements.
(2) For purposes of the calculations in accordance with Basel III (see below), total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios and total risk-weighted assets were calculated based on State Streets estimates, based upon published statements of the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve, of the effects of the requirements under Basel III affecting capital. The tier 1 common ratio is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 common capital (as described in footnote (1)), but with tier 1 capital calculated in accordance with Basel III by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which are calculated in accordance with Basel III. State Street reports its financial ratios in accordance with the requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which has not yet adopted Basel III. There remains considerable uncertainty concerning the timing for adoption and implementation of Basel III by the Federal Reserve. When adopted, the Federal Reserve may implement Basel III with some or more modifications or adjustments. Therefore, State Streets current understanding of Basel III, as reflected in the table above, may be different from the ultimate application of Basel III by the Federal Reserve to State Street.
Tier 1 capital used in the calculation of the tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios decreased by $474 million, as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to tier 1 capital of $13.520 billion as of September 30, 2011. Total capital used in the calculation of the total capital ratio decreased by $24 million, as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to total capital of $14.762 billion as of September 30, 2011.
Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation of the tier 1 common ratio was $11.909 billion, reflecting the adjustments to tier 1 capital described in the first bullet above. Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation is therefore calculated as adjusted tier 1 capital of $13.046 billion less non-common elements of capital, composed of trust preferred securities of $637 million and preferred stock of $500 million as of September 30, 2011, resulting in tier 1 common capital of $11.909 billion. At September 30, 2011, there was no qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries.
Total risk-weighted assets used in the calculation of the total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 common ratios increased by $26.505 billion as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to total risk-weighted assets of $75.262 billion as of September 30, 2011.
Consolidated adjusted quarterly average assets used in the calculation of the leverage ratio increased by $44.705 billion as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to the actual consolidated adjusted quarterly average assets of $172.532 billion as of September 30, 2011.

Investment Portfolio APPENDIX 12
Investment Portfolio  Appendix The following is intended to provide a general overview of the terms, analysis and our monthly surveillance process used in the foregoing slides that discuss State Street Corporations (State Street) investment portfolio. As a general matter, the preceding slides summarize key performance statistics including credit enhancement and the stress analysis, as determined by State Street for each asset position. It should be noted that slides represent a point in time depiction and that results can fluctuate each month.We place our securities into asset classes using industry standard nomenclature. Some of the asset classes detailed in the slides include government student loans (Govt. student loans), private student loans, credit cards, automobile and equipment (Auto/equipment), foreign residential mortgage-backed security (Foreign RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), sub-prime mortgages (Sub-prime), Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), agency mortgage-backed security (Agency MBS), non-agency mortgage-backed security, non-alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Non-Alt-A), non-agency mortgage-backed security, alternative A (Non-Agency MBS, Alt-A), and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).As noted in the slides, State Streets investment portfolio contains asset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). ABS represent a secured interest in a pool of assets, while MBS represent ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages. In evaluating each asset position for potential stressed future losses (SFL), State Street considers a number of factors including historical cumulative loss (HCL), average credit enhancement (Avg. CE), and State Streets coverage amount (Coverage). The calculation of each of these factors is discussed in detail and with more specificity below. SFL Stressed future losses are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. We can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below. INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO 13
Investment Portfolio  Appendix Government Student Loans:  Based on the average Sallie Mae Non-consolidation FFELP vintages 2001-2006.Private Student Loans:  Based on forecasted private student loan gross default rates of 17.85% with a recovery rate of approximately 48%.Credit Cards:  Based on the average industry projections for peak charge-offs in the current credit cycle.Auto/Equipment:  Based on the worst annual cumulative net loss vintage (2001) going back to 1997 using 65% Barclays prime auto index, 34% Barclays near prime auto index, and 1% Barclays sub prime index, consistent with the split of the portfolios prime, near prime, and sub prime auto holdings after backing out deals wrapped by monoline insurers. This calculation is combined with the worst experience of an agency international auto index on a 33% US, 67% non-US weighted basis.Foreign RMBS:  Applied the following assumptions weighted by regional exposureAustralian MBS:      0.0%      No losses expected, given 100% lenders mortgage insurance coverage on the underlying mortgagesDutch MBS:      0.5% Based on historical Dutch loss performance, which in recent years has been around 0.05%UK Prime MBS: 2.5% Used a simple average of five worst historical performing vintages (1987  1991), using historical severitiesUK Non-conforming: 7.5%       No historical performance available, so used 3X Prime, which is consistent with what we understand rating agencies useSpanish MBS: 3.5% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Spanish RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rateItalian MBS:    3.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Italian RMBS transactions cumulative default rate and a historically conservative recovery rateGreek MBS: 5.0% Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Greek RMBS transactions cumulative gross default figure plus an additional buffer to account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery ratePortuguese MBS: 4.0% Used a 2x multiple to the second worst performing Portuguese RMBS vintage for cumulative defaults plus an additional buffer to account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery rateIrish MBS: 5.0%    Used a 2x multiple to the worst performing Irish RMBS vintage for cumulative defaults plus an additional buffer to account for additional sovereign stress; used a historically conservative recovery rate 14
CLOs:  Based on Moodys average issuer-weighted default rate of 4% for B2-rated issuers during 1983-2009 period over assumed WAL of 4 years with 60% loss severity.  According to Moodys, the highest loss severity rate on 1st lien loans in the 1990-2009 period was 46.6% in 1993.Subprime:  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. A 70% severity rate for 2006 and 2007 vintages, a 65% for 2005 vintages, and a 55% severity rate for vintages prior to 2005 was applied to obtain the stressed future net loss.HELOC:  Main assumptions include  100% loss severity, projected loss rate of current 3-month average loss rate and projected payment rates at current 3-month average payment rates.Agency MBS:  No losses are assumed due to implied (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) or explicit (Ginnie Mae) government guarantee.Non-Agency MBS (Prime):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current Loan to Value (LTV) and a future negative Home Price Appreciation (HPA) assumption. Non-Agency MBS (Alt-A):  Calculated by applying projected loss assumptions to the remaining pool of mortgages based upon the stage within the delinquency pipeline, (i.e. current to foreclosure), to obtain a projected future gross loss. An interpolated severity based on current LTV and a future negative HPA assumption. CMBS:  Calculated by applying the highest cumulative loss experienced by any cohort vintage (1986) over the time period 1972-2002 as reported in Commercial Mortgage Defaults: 30 Years of History by Howard Esaki and Masumi Goldman, as it appeared in the Winter 2005 issue of CMBS World magazine. Investment Portfolio - Appendix 15
Investment Portfolio  Appendix HCL Historical cumulative loss is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. Avg. CE Credit enhancement is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over-collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination. Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple.  Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario.  For subprime, non-agency prime MBS, and Alt-A, coverage is calculated by dividing the break even loss value by SFL.  The break even loss is calculated by a third party provider.  It represents  the loss value a bond can withstand before experiencing a principal loss after giving benefit to all credit enhancement, both structural and excess spread, as well as any discount to the carrying value of the bond (eg. due to purchase discount or impairment). As noted above and in the slides, in performing these calculations we collect and use information provided by third party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. As noted above and in the slides, State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.

Forward-Looking Statements Other Placeholder: This presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements relating to our financial, operational, strategic, commercial, technological and other goals and expectations regarding our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program, as well as regarding other goals and expectations for our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, operating margins, strategies and the business environment. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as "plan," "expect," "look," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "seek," "may," "will," "trend," "target, and "goal," or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to October 18, 2011.Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to: delays or difficulties in the execution of our previously announced business operations and information technology transformation program, which could lead to changes in our estimates of the charges, expenses or savings associated with the planned program, resulting in increased volatility of our earnings; our ability to control operating risks, data security breach risks, information technology systems risks and outsourcing risks, and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; the manner in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators implement the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and internationally, including any increases in the minimum regulatory capital ratios applicable to us and regulatory developments that result in changes to our operating model or other changes to the provision of our services in order to comply with or respond to such regulations; required regulatory capital ratios under Basel II and Basel III, in each case as fully implemented by State Street and State Street Bank (and in the case of Basel III, when finally adopted by the Federal Reserve), which may result in the need for substantial additional capital or increased levels of liquidity in the future; changes in law or regulation that may adversely affect our, our clients or our counterparties business activities and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to compliance; financial market disruptions and the economic recession, whether in the U.S. or internationally; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities, and the liquidity requirements of our clients; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the levels of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition of the assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the possibility that we may be required to change the manner in which we fund those assets; the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure; the credit quality, credit agency ratings, and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; the maintenance of credit agency ratings for our debt and depository obligations as well as the level of credibility of credit agency ratings; the results of, and costs associated with, government investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings; the risks that acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected disynergies will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced and that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with clients, employees or regulators; the ability to complete acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, including the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the valuation of assets; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding; potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to the effects of consolidation, and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; the level and volatility of interest rates and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; our ability to measure the fair value of the investment securities on our consolidated balance sheet; adverse publicity or other reputational harm; our ability to grow revenue, attract and/or retain and compensate highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due.Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2010 Annual Report on         Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speaks only as of the date hereof, October 18, 2011, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that date. Among the initiatives incorporated within Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program, we are standardizing several core business and information technology processes, primarily through the execution of Lean efficiency principles and increased automation.  We are also creating a new technology platform, including moving many core software applications to a private cloud.  In addition, we are planning additional servicing and processing centers of excellence in globally distributed low-cost locations to improve the work allocation and responsiveness of service demands and have also expanded our relationships with strategic information technology service providers to enhance efficiencies.

AppendixNon-GAAP Financial Measures October 18, 2011 Other Placeholder: This presentation includes financial information presented on an operating basis. Operating-basis financial information is a non-GAAP presentation.  Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations.  Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
