EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
State Street Reports EPS of $0.85 for the First Quarter of 2012 on Revenue of $2.42 Billion
Core Revenue Improves from Fourth Quarter of 2011
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2012--State Street Corporation today announced first-quarter 2012 earnings per common share of $0.85, down 9% from $0.93 in the first quarter of 2011 and up 12% from $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue in the first quarter of 2012 was $2.42 billion, up 3% from $2.36 billion in the first quarter of 2011 and up 5% from $2.32 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Expenses of $1.84 billion increased 8% from $1.70 billion in the first quarter of 2011 and increased 3% from $1.78 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Return on average common shareholders equity was 8.8% in the first quarter of 2012, compared to 10.5% in the first quarter of 2011 and 7.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011.
State Street recorded $21 million ($0.03 per share) of pre-tax acquisition and restructuring costs and $15 million ($0.02 per share) for litigation-related settlements during the first quarter. Of the $21 million, $13 million was related to acquisition costs and $15 million was associated with the previously announced business operations and information technology transformation program, partially offset by a $7 million net credit associated with State Streets withdrawal from its fixed-income trading initiative.
Financial highlights for the first quarter of 2012 included:
Fee revenue increased 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting strength in each of State Streets businesses, primarily due to the impact of improved equity markets and net new business wins.
In our view, the financial markets began to show some signs of stability: average excess deposits left by clients on State Streets balance sheet declined $5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2011 as clients began to put cash back to work.
Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 22% from the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the seasonal accounting effects of approximately $105 million ($0.16 per share) of equity-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes. The Company continues to target a ratio of compensation and employee benefits to total operating-basis revenue of approximately one percentage point lower for 2012 than the 40.2% level achieved in 2011, assuming a modest increase in 2012 operating-basis revenue.

The Companys previously announced business operations and information technology transformation program remains on track to achieve approximately $94 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate operating-basis expense savings in 2012 compared to the 2010 run-rate.

Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, During the first quarter our core business momentum in asset servicing and asset management improved, compared to the second half of last year. Our success in winning new business is reflected in solid growth in both fee and total revenue. During the first quarter we won mandates for $233 billion in assets to be serviced. State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) won net new business of $41 billion, excluding the impact of the planned $31 billion reduction in assets managed for the Department of the U.S. Treasury.
Hooley continued, We are pleased with the on-going success of our business operations and information technology transformation program, from which we continue to expect to achieve approximately $94 million in annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2012. We remain committed to managing expenses carefully and continue to expect our compensation-to-revenue ratio to decline in 2012, compared to 2011, assuming a modest increase in operating-basis revenue.
1
Hooley concluded, We continue to prioritize a return of capital to our shareholders. The results of the recently completed Federal Reserve Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) underscored our strong capital position even in the face of some very aggressive stress scenarios. Reflecting that strong position, as previously announced, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.24 per common share in March for payment in April, an increase that restores the dividend to its previous split-adjusted high. In addition, the Board of Directors approved a new common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.8 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2013.
Operating basis is a non-GAAP presentation. For an explanation of our operating-basis information, refer to the addendum included in this news release.
(1)
Estimated pre-tax run-rate expense savings relate only to the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program and are based on improvement from operating-basis expenses in 2010; actual operating expenses of the Company may increase or decrease due to other factors.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on a non-GAAP, or operating, basis, in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. Descriptions of our non-GAAP, or operating-basis financial measures, together with reconciliations of operating-basis information to GAAP-basis information, are provided in the addendum included in this news release.
On an operating basis, earnings per common share of $0.84 were down 5% from $0.88 in the first quarter of 2011 and down 10% from $0.93 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue increased 3% to $2.40 billion from $2.33 billion in the first quarter of 2011 and was up 5% from $2.29 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating-basis expenses of $1.80 billion increased 7% from $1.68 billion in the first quarter of 2011 and were up 10% from $1.64 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating-basis return on average common shareholders equity was 8.6% compared to 9.9% in the first quarter of 2011 and 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating (non-GAAP) basis where noted. Amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for per-share amounts or where otherwise noted.
Total assets were $188 billion at March 31, 2012 and $217 billion at December 31, 2011 and included $17 billion and $50 billion of excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, respectively. The average balance sheet for the first quarter of 2012 was $188 billion, compared to $159 billion for the first quarter of 2011 and $195 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011. State Streets regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong as of March 31, 2012, with the Companys total capital ratio at 20.6%, its tier 1 capital ratio at 19.1% and its tier 1 leverage ratio at 7.8%. In addition, as of March 31, 2012, the Companys tier 1 common ratio was 17.1%, and its TCE ratio was 7.5%. March 31, 2012 ratios adjusted for the effects of the applicable methodologies provided for in the Basel III capital requirements are: total capital ratio of 16.0%, tier 1 capital ratio of 14.4%, tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.2%, and tier 1 common ratio of 13.2%. These ratios reflect State Streets estimates of the impact of the requirements under Basel III affecting capital, based on published statements of the Basel Committee and the Federal Reserve. Refer to the addendum included in this news release for information concerning the specified capital ratios and for reconciliations of these ratios to ratios calculated under currently applicable regulatory requirements.
At March 31, 2012, the net after-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses in the investment portfolio were $81 million, an improvement from net unrealized mark-to-market losses of $374 million at December 31, 2011, primarily due to tighter spreads, offset partially by higher rates, and an improvement from net after-tax unrealized mark-to-market losses of $352 million at March 31, 2011, primarily due to lower rates.
The Company recorded $49 million of pre-tax conduit-related accretion in the first quarter of 2012. Looking ahead, the Company continues to expect to record aggregate pre-tax conduit-related accretion of approximately $1.1 billion in interest revenue from April 1, 2012 through the remaining terms of the former conduit securities. This expectation is based on numerous assumptions, including holding the securities to maturity, anticipated pre-payment speeds, credit quality and sales.
The following tables provide the components of operating-basis revenue and operating-basis expenses for the periods noted:
Operating-Basis Revenue (non-GAAP)

Operating-Basis Expenses (non-GAAP)
(1)
FIRST-QUARTER 2012 RESULTS VS. FIRST-QUARTER 2011
Servicing fees were down 2% to $1.078 billion from $1.095 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The decrease reflected weakness in non-US markets and changes in asset mix, offset partially by net new business and a slight increase in the S & P 500. Total assets under custody and administration were $23.208 trillion at March 31, 2012, up 2.6% compared to $22.609 trillion at March 31, 2011. Daily average values as measured by the S & P 500 Index were up approximately 4% and by the MSCI EAFE Indexwere down approximately 11% from the first quarter of 2011.
ES
Investment management fees, generated by State Street Global Advisors, were $236 million, flat with the first quarter of 2011. Total assets under management at March 31, 2012, were $1.993 trillion, down 6.0% compared to $2.120 trillion at March 31, 2011 due to the scheduled reduction of $144 billion in assets managed for the Department of the U.S. Treasury, partially offset by net new business. Average month-end equity valuations for the S & P 500 Index were up 4% and for the MSCI EAFE Indexwere down approximately 10% from the first quarter of 2011.
ES
Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was $280 million for the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of 7% from $302 million in the first quarter of 2011. Foreign exchange trading revenue decreased 7% primarily due to lower volatilities, partly offset by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fees were down 8% primarily due to weaker revenue from transition management.
Securities finance revenue was $97 million in the quarter, up 47% from $66 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to higher spreads, partially offset by lower volumes.
Net interest revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, including conduit-related discount accretion, was $656 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $608 million in the first quarter of 2011. On an operating basis, excluding discount accretion, net interest revenue was $607 million, an increase of 11% from $546 million in the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to an increase in investment portfolio volume and higher yields on US floating-rate securities due to short-term LIBOR rates, offset partially by a decrease in yield in the fixed-income portfolio. Including the impact of discount accretion, net interest margin was 164 basis points in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 185 basis points in the first quarter of 2011. Operating-basis net interest margin, excluding the impact of discount accretion but including the excess deposits, was 152 basis points in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 166 basis points in the first quarter of 2011.
In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded $19 million of net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities and, separately, $8 million of net losses from other-than-temporary impairment, resulting in $11 million of net gains related to investment securities.
Operating-basis expenses of $1.799 billion in the first quarter of 2012 increased 7% compared to $1.683 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 9% from $974 million to $1,064 million, primarily due to the effects of employee demographics on equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees, merit increases in salary awarded in April 2011, and employees added as part of new business and acquisitions. Information systems and communications were flat at $191 million with the first quarter of 2011 and transaction processing services expenses were up about 1% at $181 million. Occupancy expense in the first quarter of 2012 was up about 11%, from $107 million to $119 million, primarily due to a one-time benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Other expenses increased 6%, or $13 million, to $244 million, primarily due to increased regulatory costs.
The effective tax rate on first-quarter 2012 GAAP-basis earnings was 27.2%, down from 28.7% in the first quarter of 2011. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the first quarter of 2012 was 26.6%, down from 28.0% the first quarter of 2011, but up from 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in the operating- basis effective tax rate from the fourth quarter of 2011 is primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. Our effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the full year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 27% to 28%.
FIRST-QUARTER 2012 RESULTS VS. FOURTH-QUARTER 2011
Servicing fees were $1.078 billion, up 2% from $1.057 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher average equity market valuations and net new business. Daily average values as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE Index were up approximately 10% and 7%, respectively. Management fees were $236 million, up 17% from $202 million. The increase in management fees was primarily due to improved averages of the month-end equity valuations and net new business. Average month-end equity valuations as measured by the S & P 500 and the MSCI EAFE Index were up approximately 9% and 6%, respectively. Trading services revenue, which includes foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other fees, was $280 million, up 3% from $273 million. Foreign exchange trading revenue of $149 million declined 1% due primarily to lower volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Brokerage and other fee revenue was $131 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily due to an increase in transition management revenue. Securities finance revenue was $97 million, up 8% from $90 million, primarily due to higher spreads slightly offset by lower volumes Processing fees and other revenue was up $49 million to $94 million due to the impact of fair-value adjustments related to positions in the fixed-income trading initiative.

.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue, including discount accretion, in the first quarter of 2012 totaled $656 million, compared to $638 million in the fourth quarter. On an operating basis, excluding discount accretion, fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue in the first quarter of 2012 was $607 million, up 5% from $577 million in the fourth quarter due to higher yields on both fixed-income and USD floating-rate securities.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, compensation and employee benefits expenses in the first quarter of 2012 increased $192 million, or 22%, to $1,064 million from $872 million. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the seasonal accounting effects of approximately $105 million of equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes, as well as the impact of reductions in incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2011. Other expenses were $244 million, a decrease of 11% from $274 million in the fourth quarter due primarily to a decrease in fees for professional services and lower securities processing costs.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on average common shareholders equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders equity for the period. Operating-basis return on average common equity utilizes annualized operating-basis net income available to common equity in the calculation.

STATE STREET CORPORATION
Earnings Release Addendum
Supplemental Information - Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to presenting State Streets financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, referred to as GAAP, management also presents results on a non-GAAP, or "operating," basis, in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Streets ongoing business operations from period to period. Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP. This earnings release addendum includes financial information presented on a GAAP as well as on an operating basis, and provides reconciliations of operating-basis financial measures.
This earnings release addendum also includes capital ratios in addition to, or adjusted from, those calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. These include capital ratios based on tier 1 risk-based common capital and tangible common equity, as well as capital ratios adjusted to reflect our estimate of the impact of the Basel III capital requirements. These non-regulatory and adjusted capital measures are non-GAAP financial measures. Management currently evaluates the non-GAAP capital ratios presented in this earnings release addendum to aid in its understanding of State Streets capital position under a variety of standards, including presently applicable and evolving regulatory requirements. Management believes that the use of the non-GAAP capital ratios described in this earnings release addendum similarly aids in an investor's understanding of State Street's capital position and therefore is of interest to investors. In addition to the reconciliations of the capital ratios described below, this earnings release addendum also includes reconciliations of Basel III-adjusted capital ratios to capital ratios calculated under currently applicable requirements.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in conformity with GAAP and capital ratios determined in conformity with currently applicable regulatory requirements.
Capital Ratios
, as applicable, are each calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. The total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios are used regularly by bank regulatory authorities to evaluate the Companys capital adequacy. The tier 1 risk-based common, or , ratio is sometimes used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its capital assessment and review programs. The , ratio is an additional capital ratio that management believes provides additional context for understanding and assessing the Companys capital adequacy.
The total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital and tier 1 leverage ratios
tier 1 common
tangible common equity, or TCE
The tier 1 common ratio is calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 risk-based capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities, by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which assets are calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. Management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios described in this earnings release addendum, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. Reconciliations with respect to the tier 1 common ratios as of March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2011 are provided in this earnings release addendum.
The TCE ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations with respect to the calculation of the TCE ratio as of March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2011 are provided in this earnings release addendum
