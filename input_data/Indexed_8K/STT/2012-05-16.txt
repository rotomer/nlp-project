Building from Strength Reminder This presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements relating to our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, investment portfolio performance and strategies, the financial and market outlook, governmental and regulatory initiatives and developments, and the business environment. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as "plan," program, "expect," "look," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "seek," "may," "will," "trend," "target, and "goal," or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to May 16, 2012. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to: the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure, including, for example, the direct and indirect effects on counterparties of the current sovereign debt risks in Europe and other regions; financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the U.S., Europe or other regions internationally; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition of the assets on our consolidated statement of condition and the possibility that we may be required to change the manner in which we fund those assets; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits, and the liquidity requirements of our clients; the level and volatility of interest rates and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; the credit quality, credit agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding, and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity requirements and risk profile; the manner in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators implement the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, European directives with respect to banking and financial instruments and other regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and internationally, including regulatory developments that result in changes to our operating model or other changes to the provision of our services; adverse changes in required regulatory capital ratios, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel II or Basel III, or due to changes in regulatory positions or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities; approvals required by the Federal Reserve or other regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or programs, including acquisitions, dividends and equity repurchases, that may restrict or limit our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, equity purchase programs or other capital initiatives; changes in law or regulation that may adversely affect our, our clients' or our counterparties' business activities and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to compliance; the maintenance of credit agency ratings for our debt and depository obligations as well as the level of credibility of credit agency ratings; delays or difficulties in the execution of our previously announced business operations and information technology transformation program, which could lead to changes in our estimates of the charges, expenses or savings associated with the planned program, resulting in increased volatility of our earnings; the results of, and costs associated with, government investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the valuation of assets; adverse publicity or other reputational harm; dependencies on information technology, complexities and costs of protecting the security of our systems and difficulties with protecting our intellectual property rights; our ability to grow revenue, attract and/or retain and compensate highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements; potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of consolidation, and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; potential changes in how clients compensate us for our services, and the mix of services that clients choose from us; the risks that acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial and operational benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected disynergies will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced and that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with clients, employees or regulators; the ability to complete acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; our ability to recognize emerging clients' needs and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to State Street; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, including the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; our ability to measure the fair value of the investment securities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition; our ability to control operating risks, data security breach risks, information technology systems risks and outsourcing risks, and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of the date hereof, May 16, 2012, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that date.

STATE STREET CORPORATION RECONCILIATIONS OF TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY AND TIER 1 COMMON RATIOS December 31, 2011 The ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets, or TCE ratio, is calculated by dividing consolidated total common shareholders equity by consolidated total assets, after reducing both amounts by goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred taxes. Total assets reflected in the TCE ratio also exclude cash balances on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank and other central banks in excess of required reserves. The TCE ratio is not required by GAAP or by bank regulations, but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of State Streets capital levels. Since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the TCE ratio, our TCE ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry. Tangible common equity and adjusted tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The tier 1 risk-based common, or tier 1 common, ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital, which is calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements, less non-common elements, including preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities, by total risk-weighted assets, which assets are also calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. The tier 1 common ratio is not required by GAAP or on a recurring basis by bank regulations. However, this ratio has been used by the Federal Reserve in connection with its evaluation of the capital adequacy of certain large U.S. bank holding companies. In addition, management is currently monitoring this ratio, along with the other capital ratios, in evaluating State Streets capital levels and believes that, at this time, the ratio may be of interest to investors. 2

The tier 1 common ratio was calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 common capital (as described in footnote (1)), but with tier 1 capital calculated in accordance with Basel III by, (b) total risk-weighted assets, which are calculated in accordance with Basel III. State Street calculates its capital ratios in accordance with the requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which has not yet adopted Basel III. There remains considerable uncertainty concerning the timing for adoption and implementation of Basel III by the Federal Reserve. When adopted, the Federal Reserve may implement Basel III with some or more modifications or adjustments. Therefore, State Streets current understanding of Basel III, as reflected in the table above, may be different from the ultimate application of Basel III by the Federal Reserve to State Street.  Tier 1 capital used in the calculation of the tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios decreased by $595 million, as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to tier 1 capital of $13.644 billion as of December 31, 2011. Total capital used in the calculation of the total capital ratio decreased by $141 million, as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to total capital of $14.842 billion as of December 31, 2011.  Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation of the tier 1 common ratio was $11.912 billion, reflecting the adjustments to tier 1 capital described in the first bullet above. Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation is therefore calculated as adjusted tier 1 capital of $13.049 billion less non-common elements of capital, composed of trust preferred securities of $637 million and preferred stock of $500 million as of December 31, 2011, resulting in tier 1 common capital of $11.912 billion. At December 31, 2011, there was no qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries.  Total risk-weighted assets used in the calculation of the total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 common ratios increased by $26.101 billion as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to total risk-weighted assets of $72.418 billion as of December 31, 2011.  Consolidated adjusted quarterly average assets used in the calculation of the leverage ratio increased by $45.903 billion as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to the actual consolidated adjusted quarterly average assets of $186.336 billion as of December 31, 2011. STATE STREET CORPORATION RECONCILIATIONS OF BASEL III CAPITAL RATIOS December 31, 2011 The table set forth below reconciles State Street's estimated ratios calculated in accordance with Basel III, as State Street currently understands the impact of the Basel III requirements, to capital ratios calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements, as well as the tier 1 common ratio. (1) Actual (unaudited) total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios were calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. Tier 1 common ratio was calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 capital less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities (tier 1 common capital), by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which were calculated in accordance with currently applicable regulatory requirements. 3

Management measures and compares certain financial information on an operating basis, as it believes that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to State Streets normal ongoing business operations. Management believes that operating-basis financial information, which reports revenue from non-taxable sources on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and excludes the impact of revenue and expenses outside of the normal course of business, facilitates an investors understanding and analysis of State Streets underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with GAAP.
