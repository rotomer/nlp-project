Typically, re-securitizations are created to add credit enhancement to protect investors from principal loss, downgrade, and/or impairment.  Our portfolio consists entirely of the senior-most bonds, or super senior tranche, within the re-REMIC structure. These bonds are enhanced such that principal writedowns and downgrades are unlikely. They also offer an attractive yield profile with less risk of impairment versus the underlying bond.  Avg.

6 Appendix Definitions SFL Stressed future losses, or SFL, are State Streets estimate of potential future losses under a stressed economic scenario. State Street can not provide a generic calculation applicable across all asset classes as our estimates for each asset class are unique and in many cases are not a calculation, but a figure based upon our subjective assessment of relevant worst case historical performance. In the cases where we calculate a projected loss ourselves we describe the calculation in the slides. As SFL can be based upon historical worst case scenarios, SFL will vary among the asset classes, which we describe in our slides. Certain assumptions made by State Street in estimating SFL for various asset classes are set forth below. HCL Historical cumulative loss, or HCL, is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. Average CE Average credit enhancement, or avg. CE, is determined by State Street based upon data obtained from third party providers. CE can include excess spread for the most recent year, over- collateralization, cash reserves, and subordination. Coverage Coverage is calculated by dividing CE by SFL, which results in the coverage multiple. Coverage is provided as a measure of excess enhancement above our projected future losses under a stressed economic scenario. For subprime, non-agency prime MBS, and Alt-A, coverage is calculated by dividing the break even loss value by SFL. The break even loss is calculated by a third party provider. It represents the loss value a bond can withstand before experiencing a principal loss after giving benefit to all credit enhancement, both structural and excess spread, as well as any discount to the carrying value of the bond (eg. due to purchase discount or impairment).
 
7 Appendix Definitions In performing these calculations, State Street collects and uses information provided by third-party providers. The information we used to create these slides included information from the latest surveillance reports that included data from servicer reports received during the most recent month. Third-party sources use assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining data, and different third parties may provide different data. It should be noted that certain securities report on a quarterly vs. monthly basis. For those securities, the most recent available information was used. It should be noted that industry information, rather than portfolio experience was used in certain instances where industry information resulted in a more conservative approach. State Street does not independently verify the data obtained from third-party providers that is used in determining and estimating SFL, HCL, Avg. CE and Coverage and the information is subject to the risk of inaccuracy. State Streets estimates are based upon various subjective assumptions, and there is no assurance that these assumptions accurately predict maximum potential or likely future losses.

The table also presents information with respect to the estimated impact of the recently issued U.S. Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRs, on State Street's estimated tier 1 common ratio as of June 30, 2012. (1) The tier 1 common ratio was calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 risk-based capital calculated in conformity with Basel I less non-common elements including qualifying perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities (tier 1 common capital) by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which were calculated in conformity with Basel I. (2) For purposes of the calculations in conformity with the original Basel III requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010, total risk-weighted assets were calculated using State Streets estimates, based on the original Basel III requirements and related published statements of U.S. banking regulators, of the effects of the original Basel III requirements expected to affect capital beginning in 2013. The tier 1 common ratio was calculated by dividing (a) tier 1 common capital (as described in footnote (1)), but with tier 1 risk-based capital calculated in conformity with the original Basel III requirements, by (b) total risk-weighted assets, which are calculated in conformity with Basel III. While U.S. banking regulators have published NPRs, as described below, there remains considerable uncertainty concerning the timing for finalization and implementation of Basel III in the U.S. When finalized, the proposed rules may reflect modifications or adjustments. Therefore, State Streets current understanding of the original Basel III requirements, as reflected above, may differ from the ultimate application of Basel III upon implementation in the U.S.  Tier 1 risk-based capital decreased by $617 million, as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to tier 1 risk-based capital of $13.976 billion as of June 30, 2012.  Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation of the tier 1 common ratio was $12.222 billion, reflecting the adjustments to tier 1 risk-based capital described in the first bullet above. Tier 1 common capital used in the calculation is therefore calculated as adjusted tier 1 risk-based capital of $13.359 billion less non-common elements of capital, composed of trust preferred securities of $637 million and preferred stock of $500 million as of June 30, 2012, resulting in tier 1 common capital of $12.222 billion. At June 30, 2012, there was no qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries.  Total risk-weighted assets used in the calculation of the tier 1 common ratio increased by $26.062 billion as a result of applying estimated Basel III requirements to total risk-weighted assets of $70.105 billion as of June 30, 2012. In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued three concurrent NPRs. These NPRs propose to revise the current U.S. regulatory capital framework and incorporate changes made by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework. The NPRs also propose to implement relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and restructure the U.S. capital rules into a harmonized, codified regulatory capital framework. The NPRs are currently in a comment period, with comments due in October 2012. Footnotes (3) and (4) below describe State Street's estimated tier 1 common ratio as it would be affected by the NPRs, primarily the application of the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach, or SSFA, as well as the estimated effect of run-off and reinvestment through December 2014 and the estimated effect of the planned acquisition of Goldman Sachs Administration Services, or GSAS, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. These estimates are subject to change based on regulatory clarifications, further analysis, the results of industry comment on the NPRs and other factors. (3) Presents ratios calculated in conformity with original Basel III requirements as generally described in footnote (2), but incorporates the estimated impact of the U.S. NPRs, including, among other things, application of the SSFA, the net impact of which is estimated to increase total risk-weighted assets by $15.207 billion, from $96.167 billion calculated as described in footnote (2) to $111.374 billion. (4) Presents ratios calculated in conformity with original Basel III requirements as described in footnote (2), the effect of application of the SSFA as described in footnote (3), the effect of run-off of investment securities as they mature or pay down and are replaced by subsequent reinvestment into new securities from July 2012 through December 2014, and the effect of the planned acquisition of GSAS. The net impact of run-off and subsequent reinvestment and the GSAS acquisition is estimated to reduce total risk-weighted assets by $12.179 billion, from $111.374 billion to $99.195 billion.
