(1)
Operating basis is a non-GAAP presentation. For an explanation of operating-basis information, refer to the addendum included with this news release.
(2)
Estimated pre-tax, run-rate operating-basis expense savings relate only to the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program and are based on projected incremental improvement in 2012 from total 2010 operating-basis expenses of $6.18 billion; actual expenses of the Company may increase or decrease due to other factors.
(3)
Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. Refer to the addendum included with this news release for a further discussion of these ratios and for reconciliations applicable to the tier 1 common ratio. Also, see "Capital" below.
(4)
Based on
HFMWeek
Assets under Administration Survey, May 31, 2012, which cited $505.5 billion and $200.6 billion of assets serviced for State Street and Goldman Sachs, respectively.
Chairman's Perspective
Joseph L. Hooley, State Street's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, Our third-quarter results reflect continued resilience across both asset servicing and asset management, partially offset by weakness in trading services. In a difficult environment, we were able to achieve positive operating leverage by controlling expenses and by continuing to implement our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program.
Hooley continued, "Although equity markets have improved, clients remain conservative in their investment allocations which adversely affects our revenue. We continue to see demand for our solutions as evidenced by
$211 billion
of new asset servicing wins, net new assets of
$78 billion
to be managed by State Street Global Advisors and a strong pipeline."
"We look forward to integrating the recently closed acquisition of the Goldman Sachs Administration Services business and introducing these clients to our broad range of products and services. While acquisitions are consistent with our long-term growth strategy, one of our highest priorities in the current environment is returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter, we purchased
$480 million
of common stock, leaving $840 million remaining under our $1.8 billion common stock authorization, which we plan to complete in March of 2013."
We remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our business and continue to execute against our priorities of leveraging the power of our core franchise, managing our expenses carefully, delivering value to our clients through innovation and returning capital to our shareholders, Hooley concluded.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to presenting State Street's financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management also presents results on a non-GAAP, or operating basis, in order to highlight comparable financial trends and other characteristics with respect to State Street's business operations from period to period. Descriptions of our non-GAAP, or operating-basis financial measures, together with reconciliations of operating-basis information to GAAP-basis information, are provided in the addendum included with this news release.
The table below provides a summary of selected financial information and key ratios for the indicated periods, presented on an operating (non-GAAP) basis where noted. Amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for per-share amounts or where otherwise noted.
(1)
Includes assets under custody of
$17.287 trillion
,
$16.387 trillion
, and
$15.714 trillion
, as of period-end
Q3 2012
,
Q2 2012
and
Q3 2011
, respectively.
(2)
At period end.
The following table provides the components of operating-basis (non-GAAP) revenue
(1)
for the periods noted:
Servicing fees
increased
1.3%
to
$1.1 billion
in the
third quarter of 2012
from the
second quarter of 2012
, reflecting strength in global equity markets and net new business. Compared to the
third quarter of 2011
, servicing fees decreased
0.5%
, primarily due to the impact of a weaker Euro and business mix partially offset by market impact.
Investment management fees
were
$251 million
, up
2.0%
in the
third quarter of 2012
from the
second quarter of 2012
, primarily due to stronger global equity markets. Compared to
third quarter of 2011
, management fees were up
9.6%
, primarily due to stronger equity markets and net new business.
Trading services revenue
, which includes foreign-exchange trading revenue and brokerage and other fees, was
$232 million
, down
9.0%
from the
second quarter of 2012
due to weakness in foreign-exchange and transition management. Trading services revenue decreased
30.5%
from the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to weakness in foreign-exchange trading.
Foreign-exchange trading revenue
decreased
10.9%
from the
second quarter of 2012
and
43.6%
from the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to lower volatility, partially offset by increased volumes.
Brokerage and other fees
decreased
7.1%
to
$117 million
from the
second quarter of 2012
due to weakness in transition management. Compared to the
third quarter of 2011
, brokerage and other fees decreased
10.0%
due to weaker revenue from electronic foreign-exchange trading.
Securities finance revenue
was
$91 million
, a decline of
36.4%
from the
second quarter of 2012
, due primarily to second-quarter seasonality. Compared to the
third quarter of 2011
, securities finance revenue increased
7.1%
due to higher spreads, offset partially by lower volumes.
Processing fees and other revenue
declined
50.0%
from the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to gains related to real estate and certain leases recorded in the
third quarter of
2011
and amortization expenses related to tax-advantaged investments in renewable energy in the
third quarter of 2012
.
Fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue
was
$611 million
, a decrease of
2.9%
from
$629 million
in the
second quarter of 2012
, primarily due to lower yields on earning assets. Compared to the
third quarter of 2011
, fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue was up
8.3%
from
$564 million
, largely driven by higher earning assets and lower funding costs, partially offset by lower asset yields.
Net interest margin,
including excess deposits held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, was
144
basis points in the
third quarter of 2012
compared to
154
basis points in the
second quarter of 2012
and
144
basis points in the
third quarter of 2011
.
Net gains from sales of available-for-sale securities
of
$24 million
were recorded in the
third quarter of 2012
, and separately,
$6 million
of net losses from other-than-temporary impairment were recorded, resulting in
$18 million
of net gains related to investment securities.
The following table provides the components of operating-basis (non-GAAP)
(1)
expenses
for the periods noted:
(1)
Refer to the addendum included with this news release for explanations of our non-GAAP financial measures and for reconciliations of our operating-basis financial information.
Compensation and employee benefits
decreased
2.8%
from the
second quarter of 2012
to
$916 million
and decreased
5.1%
from
third quarter of 2011
. The decrease from both periods is primarily due to lower compensation and employee benefit costs associated with the continued implementation of the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program.
Information systems and communications
were
$211 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
, up
10.5%
from the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to costs related to activities transitioned in connection with the Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program.
Transaction processing services
declined
5.6%
to
$170 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
from the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business.
Other expenses
decreased
13.4%
to
$252 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
from the
second quarter of 2012
, primarily due to lower securities processing costs and professional fees.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate
on third-quarter 2012 GAAP earnings increased to 28.3% from 24.9% in the
second quarter of 2012
due to the benefits associated with the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for the
third quarter of 2012
was
24.5%, largely in line with 24.7% in the
second quarter of 2012
and down from 27.0% in the
third quarter of 2011
, primarily due to the impact of an increase in tax-advantaged investments in renewable energy in 2012. The effective tax rate on operating-basis earnings for full-year 2012 is expected to be approximately 25.5%.
Capital
(1)
Unless otherwise specified, all capital ratios referenced in the table above and elsewhere in this news release refer to State Street Corporation and not State Street Bank and Trust Company. Refer to the addendum included with this news release for a further description of these ratios, and for reconciliations applicable to the tier 1 common and tangible common equity, or TCE, ratios presented in this table. All ratios are presented at period end. Total capital, tier 1 capital and tier 1 leverage ratios as of
September 30, 2012
presented in the table above were down modestly from June 30, 2012, primarily due to slightly higher total risk-weighted assets (slightly higher average assets for the leverage ratio) partially offset by higher capital levels.
(2)
Basel III capital ratios reflect the impact estimated by State Street of the Notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) issued by federal banking regulators in June 2012 regarding capital, primarily the application of the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA). The Capital rules in the NPR are not final. This estimate is subject to change based on regulatory clarifications, further analysis, the results of industry comment on the NPRs and other factors. Refer to the addendum included with this news release for information concerning the specified capital ratios and for reconciliations of the Basel III tier 1 common ratio to the tier 1 common ratio calculated under currently applicable regulatory guidelines.
N/A
Not applicable.
The estimated
pro forma
Basel III tier 1 common ratio
as of
September 30, 2012
was
11.3%
.
As noted above, this includes the estimated impact of the NPRs on the investment portfolio. This estimate would be
11.9%
as of
September 30, 2012
, if adjusted on a pro forma basis (i) to hypothetically give effect as of that date to all of the projected run-off and reinvestment through January 1, 2015 of our investment portfolio assets affected by the SSFA, and (ii) assuming the acquisition of GSAS occurred on
September 30, 2012
. Refer to the addendum included with this news release for a reconciliation of this ratio.
Common Stock Dividend and Share Repurchase Program
The Company purchased approximately 11.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of
$480 million
in the
third quarter of 2012
and declared a quarterly common stock dividend of
$0.24
per share. The Company has $840 million remaining under its $1.8 billion stock purchase program authorization, effective through March 2013.
Preferred Stock Dividends
In the third quarter, the Company issued fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock and redeemed its floating-rate preferred stock to take advantage of the low interest-rate environment. As a result, for the third quarter of 2012, the Company recorded preferred stock dividends composed of approximately $7 million on its floating-rate Series A perpetual preferred stock, which was redeemed on October 4, 2012, and approximately $8 million on the new Series C fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock, issued on August 21, 2012. The dividend on the new Series C perpetual preferred stock covers the first dividend period which runs from the date of issuance through December 15, 2012. As a result, the Company will not accrue a Series C perpetual preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Additional Information
All per share amounts represent fully diluted earnings per common share. Return on average common shareholders' equity is determined by dividing annualized net income available to common equity by average common shareholders' equity for the period. Operating-basis return on average common equity utilizes annualized operating-basis net income available to common equity in the calculation. Operating leverage is defined as the rate of growth of total revenue less the rate of growth of total expenses, each as determined on an operating basis.

Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by such forward-looking terminology as "plan," "expect," "look," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "seek," "may," "will," "trend," "target, and "goal," or similar statements or variations of such terms. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to October 16, 2012. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to: the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure including, for example, the direct and indirect effects on counterparties of the current sovereign debt risks in Europe and other regions; financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the U.S., Europe or other regions internationally; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition of the assets on our consolidated statement of condition and the possibility that we may be required to change the manner in which we fund those assets; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits, and the liquidity requirements of our clients; the level and volatility of interest rates and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; the credit quality, credit agency ratings, and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; our ability to attract deposits and other low- cost, short-term funding, and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity requirements and risk profile; the manner in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators implement the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, European directives with respect to banking and financial instruments and other regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and internationally, including regulatory developments that result in changes to our operating model or other changes to the provision of our services; adverse changes in required regulatory capital ratios, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel II or Basel III, or due to changes in regulatory positions or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities; increasing requirements to obtain necessary approvals of the Federal Reserve and our other regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or for other specific capital actions or programs, including acquisitions, dividends and equity repurchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, equity purchase programs or other capital initiatives may be restricted; changes in law or regulation that may adversely affect our, our clients' or our counterparties' business activities and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to compliance; the maintenance of credit agency ratings for our debt and depository obligations as well as the level of credibility of credit agency ratings; delays or difficulties in the execution of our previously announced business operations and information technology transformation program, which could lead to changes in our estimates of the charges, expenses or savings associated with the planned program, resulting in increased volatility of our earnings; the results of, and costs associated with, government investigations, litigation, and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the valuation of assets; adverse publicity or other reputational harm; dependencies on information technology, complexities and costs of protecting the security of our systems and difficulties with protecting our intellectual property rights; our ability to grow revenue, attract and/or retain and compensate highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements; potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of consolidation, and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; potential changes in how clients compensate us for our services, and the mix of services that clients choose from us; the risks that acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial and operational benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected disynergies will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced and that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with clients, employees or regulators; the ability to complete acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; our ability to recognize emerging clients' needs and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to the company; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, including the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; our ability to measure the fair value of the investment securities on our consolidated statement of condition; our ability to control operating risks, data security breach risks, information technology systems risks and outsourcing risks, and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; changes in accounting standards and practices; and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of the date hereof, October 16, 2012, and we do not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after that date.
