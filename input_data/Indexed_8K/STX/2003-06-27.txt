All distributions are subject to the approval of Seagate's board of directors and are subject to certain contractual restrictions.
 
Seagate also disclosed that it anticipates that its investment in property and equipment to increase to approximately $700 million in fiscal year 2004. This increase over the Company's historic levels of approximately $600 million annually is a result of its planned investment to expand its media production facility in Singapore during that year. Seagate expects its investment in subsequent years to return to budgeted levels of up to approximately $600 million per year. The Company plans to finance these investments from existing cash balances and cash flow from operations.
 
In updating its financial guidance, Seagate noted that its fourth fiscal quarter historically experiences the highest rate of price erosion in the fiscal year, and the Company expects the pricing environment in the quarter ended June 27, 2003 to be within historical norms. Seagate's fourth fiscal quarter also historically experiences the largest quarterly decline in unit shipment demand and the lowest level of aggregate units shipped in the fiscal year, particularly with respect to personal storage products. The Company's experience for the quarter ended June 27, 2003 with respect to unit sales of personal storage products is consistent with this trend, although it has enjoyed higher levels of enterprise unit sales than was anticipated. In light of the Company's experience to date, it expects revenues for the quarter ended June 27, 2003 of $1.53 billion to $1.56 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.33.
