"I'm very proud of the financial and operational achievements we've made in what is traditionally the most challenging quarter for the industry," said Steve Luczo, Seagate chairman and chief executive officer. "Our fourth quarter results and year-on-year growth provide strong evidence that our strategy and business model are growing value for shareholders, and reflect the continuing dedication and contribution of our employees.
 
"A key element of our strategy is to be at the forefront of profitably developing and supplying Seagate products to every major hard drive market. Our enterprise business continued to perform well with increased demand for our 6
th
generation Cheetah 10K and 3
rd
generation Cheetah 15K disc drives. Our Barracuda ATA products maintained Seagate market leadership in both the desktop and consumer markets with a majority of those drives during the quarter being shipped on our 80GB/platter platform. In June 2003, we entered the notebook market with the introduction of our Momentus product. The introduction of Momentus provides further evidence of Seagate's unique ability to deliver products to new markets utilizing common technology, design and manufacturing platforms.
 
"We remain excited about the growth opportunities for Seagate, particularly in the notebook and consumer markets. We will continue to drive profitability by investing in our technology, our people, and processes to deliver the most reliable, industry-leading products that meet our customers' requirements."
