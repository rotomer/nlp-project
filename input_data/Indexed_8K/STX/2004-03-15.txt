Item 5. Other Events and Required FD Disclosure.
 
As of January 2, 2004, the Company's balance sheet for accrued income taxes included $125 million for potential tax indemnification amounts due to VERITAS Software Corporation ("VERITAS") pursuant to the Indemnification Agreement entered into between Seagate Technology, Inc. ("Seagate Delaware"), New SAC and VERITAS in connection with the purchase of the operating assets of Seagate Delaware by New SAC in November 2000. The Internal Revenue Service has completed its review of Seagate Delaware's federal tax returns for the periods prior to the acquisition date of the operating assets, and on March 15, 2004, VERITAS received written confirmation from the Internal Revenue Service that the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had completed its review and had taken no exception to the Internal Revenue Service's conclusions. These conclusions result in no additional tax being assessed on VERITAS. The Company will record the full $125 million indemnification amount as an income tax benefit in the current quarter ending on April 2, 2004 and a corresponding increase to net income after tax. There will be no cash impact to the Company resulting from this settlement.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
