Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling the Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with paragraph (a) of Section 7.
 
(b) The Selling Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i) the Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and (ii) the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Selling Shareholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Selling Shareholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Shares, or any person controlling the Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with paragraph (a) of Section 7. The liability of the Selling Shareholder under the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by the Selling Shareholder from the sale of Shares in the Public Offering.
 
(c) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Shareholder, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict (based upon the advice of outside counsel to the indemnified party). It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriter and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Selling Shareholder and all persons, if any, who control the Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriter and such control persons and affiliates of the Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by Goldman, Sachs & Co. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Shareholder and such control persons of the Selling Shareholder, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
Shareholder. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 9(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Shareholder and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter from the resale of the shares by the Underwriter to the public. The relative fault of the Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Selling Shareholder or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The liability of the Selling Shareholder under the contribution agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by the Selling Shareholder from the sale of Shares in the Public Offering.
 
(f) The Selling Shareholder and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims,
pro rata
 
damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Selling Shareholder contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, any person controlling the Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter, the Selling Shareholder or any person controlling the Selling Shareholder, or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
10. . The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.

11. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

EXHIBIT A
 
 
1. Upon the payment and transfer contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter will acquire a security entitlement with respect to the Shares and no action based on an adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriter.
 
2. The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain Income Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
 
3. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company is an "investment company" within the meaning of, and subject to regulation under, the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-117517) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"), the Company's prospectus dated September 20, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 20, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, or the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2004, the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 28, 2004 and the description of the Company's Common Shares in the Company's Registration Statement on Form 8-A filed on December 6, 2002 (collectively, the "Incorporated Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and we take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 6 above.
In connection with, and under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Shares, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, representatives of Maples and Calder and your counsel in the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and also reviewed certain records and documents furnished to us by the Company, as well as the documents delivered to you at the closing. Certain of such records and documents were governed by Cayman Islands law and, accordingly, we necessarily relied upon directors, officers and employees of the Company, counsel to the Company in such jurisdiction and other persons in evaluating such corporate records and documents. Based upon our review of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, our reviews made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, our participation in the conferences referred to above, our review of the records and documents as described above, as well as our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder:
 
 
 
EXHIBIT B
 
 
1. Each of the Company and the Selling Shareholder is a company duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands and has full corporate power and legal right to own its property, to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus (as defined below), to execute and deliver the Documents to be executed by it and to perform the provisions of the Documents to be performed on its part.
 
2. The Documents to which each of the Company and the Selling Shareholder are a party have been duly authorized and (when signed by a Director) executed and when delivered by each of the Company and the Selling Shareholder, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Selling Shareholder enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.
 
3. The execution, delivery and performance of the Documents to which the Company or the Selling Shareholder are a party, the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby and the compliance by the Company or the Selling Shareholder with the terms and provisions thereof do not:
 
(a) contravene any law or regulation of the Cayman Islands applicable to the Company; or
 
(b) contravene the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company or the Selling Shareholder, respectively.
 
4. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Documents to which the Company or the Selling Shareholder are a party nor the consummation or performance of any of the transactions contemplated thereby by the Company or the Selling Shareholder, requires the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, or the registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of any Cayman Islands governmental or judicial authority or agency.
 
5. The law chosen in each of the Documents to govern its interpretation would be upheld as a valid choice of law in any action on that document in the courts of the Cayman Islands.
 
6. There are no stamp duties (other than the stamp duties mentioned in Schedule 2 hereto), income taxes, withholdings, levies, registration taxes, or other duties or similar taxes or charges now imposed, or which under the present laws of the Cayman Islands could in the future become imposed, in connection with the enforcement or admissibility in evidence of the Documents or on any payment to be made by the Company or the Selling Shareholder or any other person pursuant to the Documents.
 
7. None of the parties to the Documents (other than the Company and the Selling Shareholder) is or will be deemed to be resident, domiciled or carrying on business in the Cayman Islands by reason only of the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Documents to which any of them is party.
8. The statements relating to legal matters, documents or proceedings included in (a) the Prospectus under the captions "Risk FactorsControl by our Sponsor Group," "Risk FactorsLimited Protection of Shareholder Interests," "Risk FactorsAnti-Takeover Provisions Could Discourage or Prevent an Acquisition of Us," "Risk FactorsEnforcement of Civil Liabilities," "Enforcement of Civil Liabilities," "Description of Share Capital" and "Certain Income Tax Considerations" and (b) the Registration Statement in Item 15, in each case fairly and accurately summarize in all material respects such matters, documents or proceedings.
 
9. The sale of Shares by the Selling Shareholder will not be subject to any pre-emptive or similar rights.
 
10. A judgment obtained in a foreign court will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands without any re-examination of the merits:
 
(a) at common law, by an action commenced on the foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, where the judgment is final and in respect of which the foreign court had jurisdiction over the defendant according to Cayman Islands conflict of law rules and which is conclusive, for a liquidated sum not in respect of penalties or taxes or a fine or similar fiscal or revenue obligations, and which was neither obtained in a manner, nor is of a kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands; or
 
(b) by statute, by registration in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands and execution as if it were a judgment of the Grand Court, where the judgment is a judgment of a superior court of any state of the Commonwealth of Australia which is final and conclusive for a sum of money not in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine, penalty or revenue obligation and which remains enforceable by execution in that jurisdiction.
 
11. It is not necessary or advisable under the laws of the Cayman Islands that any of the Documents or any document relating thereto be registered or recorded in any public office or elsewhere in the Cayman Islands in order to ensure the validity, effectiveness or enforceability of any of the Documents.
 
12. The Company has executed an effective submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the various jurisdictions specified in the Documents.
 
13. The Company is subject to civil and commercial law with respect to its obligations under the Documents and neither the Company nor any of its assets is entitled to immunity from suit or enforcement of a judgment on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise in the courts of the Cayman Islands in proceedings against the Company in respect of any obligations under the Documents, which obligations constitute private and commercial acts rather than governmental or public acts.
 
14. Due to the effects of Hurricane Ivan as at the date of this Opinion it has not been possible to examine the Cause List and Register of Writs and Other Originating Process kept at the Clerk of Courts Office, George Town, Grand Cayman which would disclose any actions, suits or proceedings pending against the Company before any court in the Cayman Islands. So far as we are aware (having made enquiry of the board of directors of the Company and based on our examination of the
 
records of the Company referred to in Schedule 1) no steps have been, or are being, taken to compulsorily wind up the Company and no resolution to voluntarily wind up the Company has been adopted by its members.
 
15. A judgment of a court in the Cayman Islands may be expressed in a currency other than Cayman Islands dollars.
 
16. Statements as to Cayman Islands law made in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus are true and accurate in all material respects.
 
17. Legal title to the Shares is transferred by way of an instrument of transfer of shares in any usual or common form or such other form as the Directors may, in their absolute discretion, approve is executed by or on behalf of the transferor accompanied by the certificate (if any) of the Shares to which it relates (and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer) is delivered to the Company and then approved by the Directors for registration. The transfer becomes effective by the name of the transferee being entered into the Register of Members in respect of the shares transferred and a corresponding entry being made in relation to the transferor.

4. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any U.S. federal or California governmental agency or body or, to our knowledge, any U.S. federal or California court is required for the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter.
 
5.

The statements in the Prospectus under "Underwriter," insofar as such statements constitute a summary of the Underwriting Agreement, fairly present the information called for with respect to the Underwriting Agreement and fairly summarize the matters presented therein.
 
We have participated in conferences with certain officers and representatives of the Company, the Underwriter, counsel for the Company and the independent certified public accountants of the Company, at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that, (i) as of the effective date, the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which we express no belief) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) as of its issue date or as of the date hereof, the Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical data derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which we express no belief), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, we confirm that each of the Registration Statement, at the time it was declared effective by the Commission under the Securities Act, and the Prospectus, at the time it was transmitted for filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (other than the financial statements and related schedules and the financial and statistical information derived from such financial statements or schedules, as to which we express no belief) complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
