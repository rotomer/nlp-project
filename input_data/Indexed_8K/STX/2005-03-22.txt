Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On March 16, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors, acting by unanimous written consent, exercised its discretionary authority under the terms of our executive bonus plan to reduce the previously established maximum payments which may be made to our executive officers under that plan for fiscal year 2005 ending on July 1, 2005. The Compensation Committee took this action following a scheduled review of the anticipated payouts under the plan for the 2005 fiscal year in order to maintain projected payouts in line with our historical practice and industry comparables. The Compensation Committee determined that under no circumstances will payments under the plan fail to be non-deductible to us under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as a result of this action.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
