Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On August 31, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Seagate Technology (the "Company") approved the annual incentive bonus plan (i.e., cash bonus) funding targets for fiscal year 2006 ("FY 2006"), the annual performance metrics for FY 2006 for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and increases to the annual base salaries of certain executive officers. Any changes to an executive officer's annual base salary shall be effective as of September 1, 2005.
 
FY 2006 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan Funding & Performance Metrics
 
The Compensation Committee authorized the performance metrics and funding targets to be used for calculating annual bonus awards to each of the Company's executive officers for FY 2006 under the Seagate Technology Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"). The maximum funding level under this Plan for FY 2006 is 200% of the target funding level. The funding of the Plan is determined based on the Company's performance with respect to an earnings per share goal. The actual funding amount may be increased by an additional 10% if the Company achieves certain corporate quality goals relating to minimizing defective parts and product returns. The funded amount is allocated among eligible participants in the Plan based upon their base salary and their target bonus expressed as a percentage of base salary. An individual would receive his or her target bonus in the event that this Plan is funded at the target funding level. Separately, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to award a supplemental bonus outside of the Plan based on outstanding individual performance. The FY 2006 target bonus levels for the Company's senior executive officers (William Watkins, David Wickersham, Charles Pope, Brian Dexheimer, and William Hudson), who will be included as the Named Executive Officers in the Company's fiscal year 2005 ("FY 2005") proxy statement, are shown in the table below.
 
FY 2006 Increases to Base Salary
 
The following table sets forth the annual base salaries for FY 2005 and FY 2006 and the FY 2006 target bonus levels (expressed as a percentage of the individual's FY 2006 base salary, as further described above) for the Named Executive Officers. Please note that any changes to base salaries for FY 2006 became effective on September 1, 2005 and any salary increases for FY 2005 occurred during the course of FY 2005. Consequently, the FY 2005 base salary shown in the table below may be a higher amount than the actual salary earned from July 2004 through June 2005. The actual salary earned for FY 2005 will be reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the Company's FY 2005 proxy statement.
