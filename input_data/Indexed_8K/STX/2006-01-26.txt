The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, including Rule 415 thereunder, a registration statement (No. 333-122149) on Form S-3, including a prospectus, for the registration of the Shares. The term "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended to the date of this Agreement. The term "Base Prospectus" means the prospectus included in the Registration Statement. If the Company has filed or files an abbreviated registration statement to register additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 462(b) (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement") under the Securities Act, then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement.

The terms "supplement" and "amendment" or "amend" as used in this Agreement shall include all documents filed subsequent to the date of the Base Prospectus, as the case may be, by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each Selling Shareholder, each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter and such Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of such Underwriter or such Selling Shareholder within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter or such Selling Shareholder, as the case may be, furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter or such Selling Shareholder expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution.
 
(b) Each of the Selling Shareholders, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Underwriter, each person,
 
if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of such Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, and (ii) the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Selling Shareholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Shareholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. The liability of each Selling Shareholder under the indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph shall be several and not joint and shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such Selling Shareholder from the sale of Shares in the Public Offering.
 
(c) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Selling Shareholder, the directors of the Company, the officers of the Company who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or each Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(d) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict (based upon the advice of outside counsel to the indemnified party). It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriters and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section or (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for each Selling Shareholder and all persons, if any, who control such Selling Shareholder within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of the Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for any Selling Shareholder and such control persons of such Selling Shareholder,
 
such firm shall be designated in writing by such Selling Shareholder. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(e) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 9(e)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(e)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by any Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by such Selling Shareholder and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the
 
Underwriters from the resale of the Shares by the Underwriters to the public. The relative fault of any Selling Shareholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such Selling Shareholder or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The liability of any Selling Shareholder under the contribution agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds received by such Selling Shareholder from the sale of Shares in the Public Offering.
 
(f) Each of the Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(e). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(g) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Selling Shareholders contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, any Selling Shareholder or any person controlling any Selling Shareholder, or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
10. Notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by any Underwriter, the Company and each Selling Shareholder acknowledge and agree that in connection with the offering: (a) there exists no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company or any Selling Shareholder, on the one hand, and any Underwriter, on the other; (b) the relationship between the Company and the Selling Shareholders, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, is entirely and solely commercial, based on arms-length negotiations, and no Underwriter is acting as an advisor, expert or otherwise, to either the Company or to any Selling Shareholder; (c) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and each of the Selling Shareholders acknowledge that the Underwriters may have financial interests in connection with the offering in addition to the difference between the price to the public and the purchase price paid to the Selling Shareholders by the Underwriters for the Shares, and none of the Underwriters has no obligation to disclose, or account to the Company or any of the Selling Shareholders for, any of such additional financial interests. The Company and each of the Selling Shareholders hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or any Selling Shareholder may have against any Underwriter with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering contemplated by this Agreement.
No Fiduciary Duty.
 
11. The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination.
 
12. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters.
 
If, on the Closing Date any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of any Selling Shareholder to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement or because of any termination pursuant to subsection (ii) of paragraph 11 hereof, or if for any reason any Selling Shareholder shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, such Selling Shareholder will reimburse the Underwriter or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
13. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts.
 
14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

In addition to the numbered opinions set forth above, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP shall deliver a letter addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Closing Date to the effect set forth in the two succeeding paragraphs:
 
We have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement on Form S3 (File No. 333122149) filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 thereto became effective under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"), the Company's prospectus dated December 1, 2005, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated January 24, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, or any of the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and incorporated by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and we take no responsibility therefor, except as and to the extent set forth in paragraph 2 above.
 
In connection with, and under the circumstances applicable to the offering of the Shares, we participated in conferences with certain officers and employees of the Company, representatives of Ernst & Young LLP, representatives of Maples and Calder and your counsel in the course of the preparation by the Company of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and also reviewed certain records and documents furnished to us by the Company, as well as the documents delivered to you at the closing. Certain of such records and documents were governed by Cayman Islands law and, accordingly, we necessarily relied upon directors, officers and employees of the Company, counsel to the Company in such jurisdiction and other persons in evaluating such corporate records and documents. Based upon our review of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, our reviews made in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, our participation in the conferences referred to above, our review of the records and documents as described above, as well as our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder:
 
(i) we advise you that each of the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of January 24, 2006, appeared, on its face, to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no view with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and
 
(ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, as of January 24, 2006, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents), as of January 24, 2006 or as of the Closing Date, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial or statistical data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents.

EXHIBIT G
 
 
We have reviewed the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-122149) and Amendment No. 1 thereto (including the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents")) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the registration of securities (the "Shelf Securities") to be issued from time to time by the Company and have participated in the preparation of the prospectus supplement dated January 24, 2006 relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). In addition, we have examined evidence that the registration statement as so amended was declared effective under the Act on March 15, 2005. The registration statement as amended at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, including the Incorporated Documents, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the related prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents) dated March 15, 2005 relating to the Shelf Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities is hereinafter referred to as the "Basic Prospectus." The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus".
 
We have considered the statements included in the Prospectus under the caption "Underwriters" insofar as they summarize provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the addendum thereto. In our opinion, such statements fairly summarize these provisions in all material respects.
 
We have not ourselves checked the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, or otherwise verified, the information furnished with respect to other matters in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. We have generally reviewed and discussed with your representatives and with certain officers and employees of, and counsel and independent public accountants for, the Company the information furnished, whether or not subject to our check and verification. On the basis of such consideration, review and discussion, but without independent check or verification except as stated above, (i) in our opinion, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and (ii) nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that (a) the Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein at the time the Registration Statement became effective contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (b) the Prospectus as of its date or as of the date hereof contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits
 
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In expressing the foregoing opinion and belief, we have not been called to pass upon, and we express no opinion or belief as to, the financial statements or financial schedules or other financial or statistical data included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not passing upon the adequacy or accuracy of the derivation or compilation from the Company's accounting records or other sources of the financial or statistical data included in the Registration Statement or Prospectus.
