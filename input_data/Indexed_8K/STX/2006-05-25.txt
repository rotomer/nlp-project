Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 17, 2006, at the special meeting of the stockholders of Seagate Technology ("Seagate") and the annual meeting of Maxtor Corporation ("Maxtor"), both Seagate's and Maxtor's stockholders adopted the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of December 20, 2005, by and among Seagate and Maxtor and MD Merger Corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Seagate. Subsequent to the special and annual meetings, on May 19, 2006, Maxtor merged with and into Seagate.
On May 19, 2006, Seagate entered into (i) a First Supplemental Indenture (the "2005 Supplemental Indenture") with Maxtor and U.S. Bank National Association amending and supplementing the Indenture dated as of August 15, 2005 (the "2005 Prior Indenture" and as amended by the 2005 Supplemental Indenture, the "2005 Indenture"), providing for the issuance by Maxtor of its 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 15, 2012 (the "2005 Notes") and (ii) a First Supplemental Indenture (the "2003 Supplemental Indenture") with Maxtor and U.S. Bank National Association amending and supplementing the Indenture dated as of May 7, 2003 (the "2003 Prior Indenture" and as amended by the 2003 Supplemental Indenture, the "2003 Indenture"), providing for the issuance by Maxtor of its 6.80% Convertible Senior Notes due April 30, 2010 (the "2003 Notes"). As of April 1, 2006, $326,000,000 principal amount of 2005 Notes was outstanding and $135,729,000 principal amount of 2003 Notes was outstanding.
Pursuant to the 2005 Supplemental Indenture and the 2003 Supplemental Indenture, Seagate agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee all of Maxtor's obligations under the 2005 Notes, the 2005 Indenture, the 2003 Notes and the 2003 Indenture, including all payments of principal and interest.
Interest on the 2005 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each February 15 and August 15. The 2005 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at Seagate's option on or after August 20, 2010 at 100.68% of the principal amount or on or after August 15, 2011 at 100.34% of the principal amount, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Interest on the 2003 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 30 and October 30. The 2003 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at Seagate's option on or after May 5, 2008, at 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days the sale price of the Seagate common shares shall have exceeded 130% of the conversion price in effect on the last day of such 30-day period.
The holders of the 2005 Notes and the 2003 Notes may require Seagate to repurchase all or a portion of the relevant series of Notes for 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes. Repayment of amounts due under the Notes of each series will be accelerated in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency, and may be accelerated by the trustee or holders of 25% of the Notes' principal value immediately upon default of payment of principal or after thirty days upon failure to pay interest when due or upon Seagate's default on its conversion or repurchase obligations, failure of Seagate to give timely notice of a fundamental change, failure of Seagate to comply with any of its other agreements in the Notes or indenture, or upon cross-default by Seagate or a designated subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture) for failure to make a payment at maturity or the acceleration of other debt of Seagate or a designated subsidiary, in either case exceeding $50 million (in the case of the 2005 Notes) or $25 million (in the case of the 2003 Notes).
 
The 2005 Supplemental Indenture provides that the 2005 Notes shall be convertible into 56.6503 Seagate common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2005 Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $17.65 per Seagate common share. The 2005 Notes are subject to the following conditions to conversion: (1) the closing sale price of Seagate's common shares exceeding 110% of the conversion price for a specified period; (2) the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2005 Notes being below 100% of the conversion value of the Notes during a specified period; (3) certain corporate transactions, events or fundamental changes occurring; or (4) Seagate calling the 2005 Notes for redemption. The 2005 Notes are currently convertible into Seagate common shares as a result of meeting the conversion conditions under the terms of the indenture. The conversion period will end on July 1, 2006 unless Seagate's common stock trades at a price in excess of 110% of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days during the last 30 trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. If this condition is met, the conversion period will extend for another fiscal quarter. Pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Indenture, Seagate will be required to deliver cash to holders upon any conversion in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the principal amount of the notes tendered for conversion and (b) the aggregate value of the conversion rate for the 2005 Notes multiplied by the average sale price of the Seagate common shares for the 10 consecutive trading days commencing on the trading day next succeeding the conversion date (the "conversion value"). If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of 2005 Notes converted, Seagate may, at its discretion, pay the excess in cash or in its common shares, using the sales price of its common shares during the same 10 consecutive trading day period.
The 2003 Supplemental Indenture provides that the 2003 Notes shall be convertible into 30.1733 Seagate common shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2003 Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $33.14 per Seagate common share. The 2003 Notes are not subject to conditions to conversion. Pursuant to the terms of the 2003 Indenture, Seagate may (but is not obligated to) settle any conversions in cash, common shares, or a combination thereof.
The 2005 Notes are also subject to the provisions of a Resale Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") entered into by Maxtor with the initial purchasers of the 2005 Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, Maxtor agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the 2005 Notes, at the cost of Maxtor, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 90 days after the original issuance of the 2005 Notes and use its best efforts to cause to become effective within 180 days after the original issuance of the 2005 Notes, a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the 2005 Notes and the Seagate common shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes. In addition, Maxtor agreed to pay liquidated damages in the form of additional interest if it fails to register the 2005 Notes within, and to keep the shelf registration statement effective during the specified time periods. Maxtor is obligated to use its best efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earliest of (a) two years after the last date of original issuance of any of the 2005 Notes, (b) the date when the holders of the 2005 Notes and the Seagate common shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are able to sell all such securities immediately pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act or (c) the date when all of the 2005 Notes and the Seagate common shares issuable upon conversion of the 2005 Notes are disposed of pursuant to the shelf registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Seagate agreed to use its best efforts to maintain an effective registration statement with respect to the Seagate common shares issuable upon conversion of the 2005 Notes pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement.
Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
On May 17, 2006, at the special meeting of the stockholders of Seagate and the annual meeting of the stockholders of Maxtor, both Seagate's and Maxtor's stockholders adopted the Merger Agreement described above. Subsequent to the special meeting, on May 19, 2006, Maxtor merged with and into Seagate.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Maxtor common stock was exchanged for 0.37 common shares of Seagate stock. Seagate issued approximately 98 million shares to former Maxtor stockholders, giving the former shareholders of Maxtor an approximate 17% stake in Seagate. Based on the closing price of $24.95 per share of Seagate's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on May 19, 2006, the last trading day before the closing of the Merger, the aggregate value of the consideration paid to former Maxtor stockholders in connection with the Merger is expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. For purposes of accounting, the equity consideration was measured based on Seagate's stock price of $20.02. See Note 1 of Exhibit 99.4. With the close of the transaction, Maxtor, which traded under the symbol "MXO", ceased to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
The information set forth above under Item 1.01, entry into a material definitive agreement, is hereby incorporated by reference.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
Effective as of the closing of the Merger on May 19, 2006, James Coulter resigned as a director of Seagate. Mr. Coulter's resignation was not as a result of any disagreements with Seagate.
 
Effective as of the closing of the Merger on May 19, 2006, Dr. C.S. Park, who previously served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Maxtor, was appointed to the board of directors of Seagate. Dr. Park was appointed to the Seagate board pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. As of the date of this filing, it has not been determined whether Dr. Park will serve on any of the committees of Seagate's board of directors. Seagate will file an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K if, in the future, Dr. Park is appointed to any of the committees of Seagate's board of directors. Upon his appointment to the Seagate board, Dr. Park received an initial grant of options to purchase 25,000 shares of Seagate stock (in lieu of the initial option grant for 100,000 shares customarily awarded to newly-appointed non-employee directors) pursuant to Seagate's 2004 Stock Compensation Plan. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, Dr. Park will receive compensation for his service as a Seagate director on the terms applicable to all Seagate non-employee directors, as described in Seagate's current report on Form 8-K filed on December 22, 2005. There are no transactions between Dr. Park and Seagate requiring disclosure pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. A description of the material terms of Dr. Park's interest in the merger transaction is set forth on pages 62 to 66 of Seagate's Amendment No. 1 to Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-132420), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2005.

Amendments to the Security.
3.1 .
Section 8
(a) The first four paragraphs under the heading "" in Section 8 of the form of Security are hereby amended in their entirety to read as follows:
Conversion Upon Specified Corporate Transactions
. If Parent elects to:
Conversions Upon Certain Distributions
(a) distribute to all Holders of Common Stock rights that are exercisable for not more than 45 days entitling them to purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of the distribution, other distributions pursuant to a stockholder rights plan unless such plan is triggered, or
(b) distribute to all Holders of Common Stock the Company's or Parent's assets, debt securities or certain rights to purchase its securities (other than Common Stock), which distribution has a per share value as determined by the Board of Directors in its good faith judgment, which shall be conclusive, exceeding 15% of the Sale Price of a share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of the distribution,
the Company must notify the Holders of the Securities at least 20 days prior to the ex-dividend date for such distribution. Once the Company has given such notice, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion at any time until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the "ex-dividend" date or the Company's announcement that such distribution will not take place, even if the Securities are not otherwise convertible at such time. No Holder may exercise this right to convert if the Holder otherwise may participate in the distribution without conversion. The "ex-dividend" date is the first date upon which a sale of the Common Stock does not automatically transfer the right to receive the relevant distribution from the seller of the Common Stock to its buyer.
(b) The two paragraphs under the heading " in Section 8 of the form of Security are hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
Conversion upon Specified Events"
. If Parent is party to any transaction or event (including any consolidation, merger or binding share exchange, but excluding changes resulting from a subdivision or combination) pursuant to which substantially all shares of its Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, a Holder may surrender Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date that is 15 days prior to the anticipated Effective Date of the transaction until the earlier of 15 days after the actual date of such transaction or the date that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, announces that such transaction will not take place; provided, however, if such transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, a Holder may only surrender Securities for conversion at any time from and after the date the Company or Parent, as the case may be, provides the Company Notice relating to such Fundamental Change through the Repurchase Date specified in such Company Notice. The Company or Parent, as the case may be, will notify Holders and the Trustee as promptly as practicable following the date it publicly announces such transaction (but in no event less than 15 days prior to the effective time of such transaction unless such transaction also constitutes a Fundamental Change, in which case such notice will be provided no later than the date the Company or Parent, as the case may be, provides the Company Notice relating to such Fundamental Change).
Conversions Upon Specified Events
 
At the effective time, settlement of the Securities and the Conversion Value and the Net Amount will be based on the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property of Parent or another person that the Holder would have received had the Holder converted its Security immediately prior to the transaction, unless Parent has elected to adjust the conversion rate for a Public Acquirer Change of Control as described in the Indenture. If a Holder converts its Securities in accordance with the previous paragraph and is entitled to an adjustment for Additional Shares as described in Section 10.05 of the Indenture, conversion of the Securities will settle after the effective time of such transaction. In addition, if Holders convert their Securities at any time following the effective time of the transaction, the Net Amount will be paid based on the kind and amount of such cash, securities or other property.

EXHIBIT 99.4
Seagate acquired all of the outstanding common shares and options to purchase common shares of Maxtor in a stock for stock transaction announced on December 21, 2005 and consummated on May 19, 2006. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of Seagate Technology ("Seagate") and Maxtor Corporation ("Maxtor") after giving effect to the acquisition of Maxtor by Seagate (the "Merger") using the purchase method of accounting and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2006 and the fiscal year ended July 1, 2005 are presented as if the acquisition had occurred on July 3, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the acquisition had occurred on March 31, 2006. You should read this information in conjunction with the:
 
 
 
 
 
The pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Merger had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include the effects of:
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Seagate's management, with the assistance of a third party valuation firm, has estimated the preliminary fair value of the intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of long-term debt and unearned stock compensation were based on market prices as of May 19, 2006. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration issued and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Since these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the Merger, the actual amounts recorded for the Merger may differ materially from the information presented. These allocations are subject to change pending further review of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the impact of potential restructuring activities and actual transaction costs. Additionally, the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be materially impacted by the results of Maxtor's operations up to the closing date of the Merger on May 19, 2006.
The valuation associated with unearned compensation related to stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units held by Maxtor employees reflected herein was calculated at the closing date of the Merger and does not consider employee terminations that may occur as a result of restructuring activities, which may significantly affect the amount, timing and recognition of the unearned compensation. Based on the fair value of Seagate common stock at May 19, 2006, the amount of the compensation charge Seagate would record associated with Maxtor employees would be approximately $29 million in the first year after the closing of the Merger with a remaining $46 million to be recorded over the second and third years after the closing of the Merger. However, the timing of the compensation charge may be significantly affected by the effect of employee terminations as a result of restructuring activities, the effect of which was not considered herein.
Seagate and Maxtor have different fiscal year ends which end on the Friday closest to June 30 and the last Saturday in December, respectively. As such, Maxtor's historical results have been aligned to more closely conform to those of Seagate. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made to Maxtor's historical financial statements to conform to the presentation used in Seagate's historical financial statements. Such reclassifications had no effect on Maxtor's previously reported net loss or loss from continuing operations.

1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
On December 20, 2005, Seagate and Maxtor entered into a definitive Merger agreement and announced the merger on December 21, 2005. The transaction was consummated on May 19, 2006 and Maxtor became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seagate. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total estimated purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion is comprised of Seagate common shares and assumed stock options and restricted stock units.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented to give effect to Seagate's acquisition of Maxtor as if the transaction had been consummated on March 31, 2006. The statement of operations is presented as if the transaction had been consummated on July 3, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet provides for the issuance of approximately 98 million Seagate common shares, based upon a fixed exchange ratio of 0.37 Seagate common shares for each outstanding share of Maxtor common stock as of May 19, 2006. Under the purchase method of accounting, the fair value of the total consideration was measured using an average of Seagate's closing share prices beginning two days before and ending two days after December 21, 2005, the date by which the acquisition was agreed to and announced. Based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.37 Seagate common shares for each outstanding share of Maxtor common stock and the total number of Maxtor options and restricted stock outstanding at May 19, 2006, Seagate assumed Maxtor options to purchase an equivalent of approximately 7.1 million Seagate common shares at a weighted average exercise price of $16.26 per share and restricted stock to purchase an equivalent of approximately 1.5 million Seagate common shares.
The fair value of options assumed was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and a stock price of $20.02, which represents the average closing price of Seagate common shares from two trading days before to two trading days after the December 21, 2005 announcement date.
The total estimated equity purchase price of the Merger is as follows (in millions):
 
 
Preliminary Estimated Purchase Price Allocation
The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price to Maxtor's tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values. The fair values of long-term debt and unearned stock compensation were based on market prices May 19, 2006. The valuation of these tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities are subject to updated valuations and further review by management, which may result in material adjustments. Adjustments to these estimates may be included in the final allocation of the purchase price of Maxtor, if the adjustment is determined within the purchase price allocation period (up to twelve months from the closing date). The excess of the purchase price over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill. The total purchase price of $2.070 billion does not include the effect of restructuring (see Note 4) and has been allocated as follows (in millions):
 
Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
We have estimated the fair value of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Some of these estimates are subject to change, particularly those estimates relating to deferred taxes and Merger-related restructuring costs (see Note 4). These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to updated valuations and further review by management, which may result in material adjustments. Furthermore, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be affected and materially changed by the results of Maxtor's operations up to the closing date of the Merger. The estimates related to deferred taxes are also subject to change. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect adjustments to liabilities that will result from expected restructuring activities after the Merger closes, as management, with approval from the Board of Directors, is continuing to assess and formulate the restructuring plan and the timing and financial impact cannot yet be fully determined (see Note 4).
 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the fixed assets acquired from Maxtor and their estimated useful lives (dollars in millions):
 
Identifiable intangible assets
We have estimated the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, using the income approach. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to updated valuations and further review by management, which may result in material adjustments. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their weighted average estimated useful lives (dollars in millions):
 
In-process research and development
In-process research and development ("IPRD") represents Maxtor research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use when acquired. Using the income approach to value the IPRD, Seagate determined that $32 million of the purchase price represents purchased in-process technology. Due to its non-recurring nature, the IPRD expense has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The IPRD costs will be expensed in Seagate's consolidated financial statements in the period in which the transaction closes.
 
2. LONG-TERM DEBT
Upon the closing of the Merger, Seagate assumed Maxtor's outstanding debt, including Maxtor's senior convertible notes. The senior notes will remain outstanding and convertible at the option of the holder, subject to their terms and conditions as set forth below (assuming that no other event occurs which would cause any adjustment to the conversion feature of such notes in accordance with their terms). In addition, upon the closing of the Merger, Seagate and Maxtor entered into a supplemental indenture whereby Seagate agreed to unconditionally guarantee the notes on a senior unsecured basis. In the event of conversion,
 
 
Both the 2.375% convertible senior notes due 2012 and the 6.8% convertible senior notes due 2010 were determined to have a fair market value substantially in excess of par value (as defined as premium in excess of 10% of the par value). In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 14, both the 2.375% and 6.8% senior notes were recorded at par value plus the lesser of the full amount of premium or premium that when amortized over the life of the note would result in interest expense no less than zero. The premium in excess of that when amortized over the life of the note would result in interest expense of less than zero was allocated to additional paid-in capital. All other debt was recorded at fair market value. See Note 3, (o).

4. RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO POST-MERGER SEAGATE ACTIVITIES
As part of combining the two companies, Seagate expects to incur significant restructuring costs during the year commencing with the closing of the Merger. These costs will be recognized as assumed liabilities in accordance with EITF Issue No 95-3, with a resulting increase in goodwill. The restructuring costs will be primarily comprised of severance and relocation payments associated with Maxtor employees and costs to vacate certain Maxtor facilities that existed prior to the closing of the Merger. Seagate may also incur costs associated with canceling or reducing Maxtor's existing purchase commitments for materials, equipment and services. These charges and related impact are not reflected in the pro forma financial statements, as management, with approval from the Board of Directors, is continuing to assess and formulate the restructuring plan and the timing and financial impact cannot yet be fully determined.

5. TAX DISCLOSURES
Upon the combination of the two companies, Seagate expects that the companies' respective U.S. entities would be taxed in the U.S. on a consolidated basis. The use of Maxtor's U.S. losses to offset Seagate's U.S. income would have eliminated Seagate's U.S. tax liabilities for the periods covered. To account for this Seagate decreased the pro forma combined provision for income taxes by $18 million and $7 million for the year ended July 1, 2005 and the nine months ended March 31, 2006, respectively.
At the closing of the Merger, Seagate expects to record a valuation allowance against substantially all of its U.S. deferred tax assets due to anticipated U.S. losses Maxtor is expected to incur subsequent to the merger. Due to the non-recurring nature of this increase in the valuation allowance, the $56 million provision for income taxes related to the increase in the valuation allowance has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. The provision for income taxes will be expensed in Seagate's consolidated financial statements in the period in which the Merger closes.
6. CERTAIN NON-RECURRING ITEMS
At the time of the Merger agreement, Seagate agreed to a Maxtor retention program that included cash retention bonuses to be paid to certain Maxtor employees. These bonuses will aggregate up to $100 million of which 20% vested on the closing date and the remaining 80% will vest six months thereafter. The accompanying pro forma financial statements do not include the impact of these retention bonuses due to their non-recurring nature.
