Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
FY 2006 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan Payments
On August 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee authorized the payment of an annual bonus to each of our executive officers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 ("FY 2006") under our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan ("Plan"). Based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of our financial and operational performance and the performance of each named executive officer, the committee awarded each of our named executive officers a bonus payment under the Plan equal to 200% of the target bonus previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 7, 2005. An additional bonus payment to David Wickersham of $187,500 was authorized by the Compensation Committee outside of the Plan pursuant to its discretionary authority, and as such, the total bonus payment awarded to Mr. Wickersham for FY 2006 was $2,000,000 ($1,812,500 of which will be paid pursuant to the terms of the Plan). Acting within its discretionary authority, the Compensation Committee awarded a bonus of $250,000 to Stephen J. Luczo for FY 2006. As an executive director, Mr. Luczo does not receive any other director compensation.
FY 2007 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan Funding & Performance Metrics
On August 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee also authorized the performance metrics and funding targets to be used for calculating annual bonus awards to each of the Company's executive officers for the fiscal year ending June 29, 2007 ("FY 2007") under the Plan. The maximum funding level under this Plan for FY 2007 is 200% of the target funding level. The funding of the Plan is determined based on the Company's performance with respect to an earnings per share goal. The actual funding amount may be increased by an additional 10% if the Company achieves certain corporate quality goals relating to minimizing defective parts and product returns. The funded amount is allocated among eligible participants in the Plan based upon their base salary and their target bonus expressed as a percentage of base salary. For FY 2007, the Compensation Committee decided to retain the same target bonus levels, expressed as a percentage of base salary, for the Company's senior executive officers (William Watkins, David Wickersham, Charles Pope, Brian Dexheimer, and William Hudson), who will be included as the Named Executive Officers in the Company's FY 2006 proxy statement, as were in effect for FY 2006. The target bonus levels for FY 2006 were disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 7, 2005. Each individual would receive his or her target bonus in the event that this Plan is funded at the target funding level. Separately, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to award a supplemental bonus outside of the Plan based on outstanding individual performance.
