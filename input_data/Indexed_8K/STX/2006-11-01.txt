Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Agreement with Stephen J. Luczo
On October 26, 2006, Seagate Technology entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") with Stephen J. Luczo, the Chairman of its Board of Directors, pursuant to which Mr. Luczo's employment as an executive of Seagate and any subsidiary of Seagate terminated effective as of October 26, 2006. Under the Agreement, Mr. Luczo will continue to serve as the Chairman of Seagate's Board of Directors in a non-executive capacity. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Luczo will be entitled to receive equity awards and directors' fees on the same basis as other non-employee members of Seagate's Board of Directors. In addition, Mr. Luczo will be entitled to receive an additional annual retainer fee in the amount of $150,000, payable in quarterly installments, for his services as Chairman. The Agreement has retroactive effect back to the beginning of Seagate's current fiscal year that began on July 1, 2006. Accordingly, Mr. Luczo will be entitled to receive a one-time catch-up payment equal to the directors' fees that would have been paid for the current fiscal year had Mr. Luczo's service as non-executive Chairman commenced on July 1, 2006 and will not be entitled to any bonus compensation for the current fiscal year or any subsequent fiscal year for which he would have been eligible had his employment continued. On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors also awarded Mr. Luczo an option to purchase 100,000 Seagate common shares, pursuant to the 2004 Stock Compensation Plan. Mr. Luczo shall continue to be provided an office at Seagate's corporate headquarters along with administrative support to the extent reasonably necessary to allow him to perform his duties as Chairman.
Non-Employee Director Compensation
On October 26, 2006, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of Seagate Technology approved changes to the compensation offered to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors, effective immediately.
The current board membership annual retainers and the current committee chair and membership annual retainers will be maintained at their current levels, however, in addition to those annual retainers, the Board member serving as the Chairman of the Board of Directors will receive an annual cash retainer of $150,000, payable in quarterly installments.
The revised Seagate Technology Non-Employee Board Member Compensation, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, replaces in its entirety the Seagate Technology Approved Fiscal Year 2006/2007 Independent Board Member Compensation, dated April 27, 2006 that was attached as Exhibit 10.25 to Seagate's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 11, 2006.
Amendment to 2004 Stock Compensation Plan
At the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on October 26, 2006, the shareholders of Seagate Technology approved an amendment to the Seagate Technology 2004 Stock Compensation Plan that increases the number of Seagate's common shares available for awards under the 2004 Stock Compensation Plan from 27,500,000 shares to 63,500,000 shares, representing an increase of 36,000,000 shares.
