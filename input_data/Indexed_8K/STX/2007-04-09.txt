Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 April 9, 2007  Seagate Technology (NYSE: STX) today provided an update on its expected results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 30, 2007. Revenue for the fiscal third quarter is now expected to be approximately $2.8 billion, compared to prior guidance of $2.9-3.0 billion, and GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins did not achieve the company's expectations.
SCOTTS VALLEY, CA
Primary factors impacting revenue and profitability, which became evident toward the end of March, were a lower than expected industry demand for 3.5-inch ATA disc drives and a more aggressive than planned pricing environment for high capacity 3.5-inch ATA disc drives.
The company believes that its market share, both in total and within each market currently served, is virtually unchanged from the previous quarter. Further, Seagate's inventories on-hand in the distribution channel are under five weeks. Overall, the company's results continue to be healthy and are reflective of its leadership position in an industry where consumers and applications are using, creating and sharing digital content at an accelerating pace.
