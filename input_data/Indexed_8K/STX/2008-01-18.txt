These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to the company's future operating and financial performance, including expected revenue, net income and diluted earnings per share (presented on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP adjusted basis), price and product competition, customer demand for our products, and general market conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to Seagate as of the date of this press release. Current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors may be beyond the company's control. In particular, such risks and uncertainties include the impact of the variable demand and the aggressive pricing environment for disc drives; dependence on Seagate's ability to successfully qualify, manufacture and sell its disc drive products in increasing volumes on a cost-effective basis and with acceptable quality, particularly the new disc drive products with lower cost structures; the impact of competitive product announcements and possible excess industry supply with respect to particular disc drive products; and market conditions and alternative cash imperatives which could impact our ability to repurchase stock.

Quarterly Results
On January 17, 2008, Seagate reported revenue of $3.4 billion, GAAP net income of $403 million, and diluted net income per share of $0.73 for the quarter ended December 28, 2007. These financial results include approximately $31 million in accounting charges, other costs and related tax effects associated with recent acquisitions as well as a net gain from asset sales of $15 million. These results compare to revenue of $3.0 billion, net income of $140 million and diluted net income per share of $0.23 in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the quarter ended December 28, 2007 also includes a charge of approximately $27 million dollars associated with on-going restructuring charges.
For the six months ended December 28, 2007, Seagate reported revenue of $6.7 billion, GAAP net income of $758 million, and diluted net income per share of $1.37. These financial results include approximately $61 million in accounting charges, other costs and related tax effects associated with recent acquisitions as well as a net gain from asset sales of $15 million. These results compare to revenue of $5.8 billion, net income of $159 million and diluted net income per share of $0.27 in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the six months ended December 28, 2007 also includes a charge of approximately $32 million dollars associated with on-going restructuring charges.
Cash and Uses of Cash
Cash flow from operations was $724 million for the December 2007 quarter and approximately $1.5 billion for the six months ended December 28, 2007.
We made capital investments of $212 million during the December 2007 quarter. Based on the current customer requirements and planned equipment utilization, we expect our fiscal year 2008 capital investment to be unchanged at approximately $900 million.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities ended the quarter at approximately $1.8 billion, up $252 million from the previous quarter. During the December quarter, Seagate returned approximately $300 million of cash to its shareholders through the payment of approximately $50 million in quarterly dividends and approximately $250 million of share repurchases.
Inventory
Reported inventory as of December 28, 2007 was $830 million, an increase of $67 million from the September 2007 quarter. Inventory turnover decreased to approximately 12 turns primarily due to an increase of $76 million in finished goods. This increase was partially offset by a $9 million reduction in work in process and raw materials.
Dividend and Stock Repurchases
The company has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on or before February 15, 2008 to all common shareholders of record as of February 1, 2008.
During the quarter ended December 28, 2007, the company repurchased approximately 9.3 million of its common shares related to its share repurchase plan. The average price of the shares delivered to the company in the December quarter was $27.00. The company has authorization to purchase approximately $474 million of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program.
