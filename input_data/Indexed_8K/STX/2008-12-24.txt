On December 22, 2008, Seagate Technology (the "Company") concluded that it will be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Company's goodwill, largely as a result of the adverse impact of the current macroeconomic business environment on the Company's long-term financial outlook. In connection with the evaluation of goodwill, the Company is also evaluating its long-lived assets, principally, property, equipment and leasehold improvements and certain other intangible assets for impairment. The Company expects to record a material non-cash charge(s) in the current fiscal quarter ending January 2, 2009, for the impairment of goodwill, and potentially, of other long-lived assets. The impairment(s) will not result in any current or future cash expenditures.
The Company expects that the impairment charge(s) will be material, but at the time of this filing, it is unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of amounts of the impairment charge(s). The Company will file an amended report on Form 8-K/A under this Item 2.06 promptly and in any event within four business days after it makes a determination of such an estimate or range of estimates.
