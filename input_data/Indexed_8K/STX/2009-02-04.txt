Item 5.02(e)
Compensation Recovery Policy
On January 29, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Seagate Technology (the "Company") adopted the Seagate Technology Compensation Recovery for Fraud or Misconduct Policy (the "Compensation Recovery Policy") which provides standards for recovering compensation from an executive officer where such compensation was based on incorrectly reported financial results due to the fraud or willful misconduct of such executive officer. The executive officer's repayment obligation applies to any bonus paid, stock grant issued and/or vested or stock option exercised during the period (the "Covered Period") commencing with the later of the effective date of the Compensation Recovery Policy or the date that is four years prior to the beginning of the fiscal year in which a restatement is announced and ending on the date recovery is sought, but only to the extent the compensation was awarded after the effective date of the policy.
Under the Compensation Recovery Policy, a recovery event is triggered if the Company issues a restatement of financial results and the independent members of the Board determine in good faith that the fraud or misconduct of an executive officer was a significant contributing factor to such restatement. In such event, the Board will seek the recovery of a cash bonus paid, or performance-based stock grant that vested, during the Covered Period (in either case, having a value of at least $100,000) to the extent it would not have been paid or vested, as applicable, based on the restated financial results. Additionally, if the executive officer either (i) sold any shares of stock acquired upon the exercise of stock options or (ii) sold any shares of stock attributable to non-performance-based stock grants during the Covered Period, the Board will seek to recover the proceeds of any such sales to the extent the proceeds in either case exceed $100,000 in the aggregate. The Board will provide the executive officer with a statement calculating the amount to be repaid to the Company.
