Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
Overview
As previously disclosed on April 6, 2009, Seagate Technology ("Seagate" or the "Company") and its subsidiary Seagate Technology HDD Holdings ("Seagate HDD") entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Amended Credit Agreement") by and among the Company and Seagate HDD, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), Morgan Stanley Bank N.A., as syndication agent, and BNP Paribas, Keybank National Association, Wachovia Bank, National Association and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as co-documentation agents.

In connection with the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Agreement, Seagate HDD, the Company and certain other material subsidiaries of the Company (the Company and such subsidiaries, collectively, the "Initial Loan Guarantors") entered into the U.S. Guarantee Agreement with the Administrative Agent, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference, pursuant to which Seagate HDD's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement became guaranteed by the Initial Loan Guarantors. In addition, the Company, Seagate HDD and/or certain of the Initial Loan Guarantors entered into, among others, the following agreements with the Administrative Agent:
 
 
 
 
 
The agreements listed above (collectively the "Loan Security Agreements"), or in the case of the Equitable Share Mortgages, a form thereof, are filed as Exhibits 10.2 through 10.6 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Security
The Amended Credit Agreement provides that, subject to the provisions below, Seagate HDD's and the other Loan Parties' (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement must be secured by first-priority liens granted by Seagate HDD, the Initial Loan Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in the United States of America (including any State thereof and the District of Columbia), the Cayman Islands, Northern Ireland, Singapore and The Netherlands (such Initial Loan Guarantors, the "Initial Loan Grantors," and such jurisdictions collectively referred to herein as the "Collateral Jurisdictions"), and future material Loan Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in the Collateral Jurisdictions (such future guarantors, together with the Initial Loan Grantors, the "Loan Grantors") on substantially all assets of Seagate HDD and the Loan Grantors (whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired) and subject to certain permitted liens, including without limitation:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing:
 
 
As required by the Amended Credit Agreement, on the Effective Date, pursuant to the Loan Security Agreements, the Loan Parties' obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement were secured by first-priority liens granted by Seagate HDD and the Initial Loan Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in the Cayman Islands and the United States of America (including any State thereof and the District of Columbia) on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, subject to certain permitted liens. Pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, Seagate HDD has a 90-day period from the Effective Date (which period may be extended by the Administrative Agent by up to 60 days) to secure the Loan Parties' obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement with first priority liens granted by the Initial Loan Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in The Netherlands, Northern Ireland and Singapore on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, subject to certain permitted liens.
The above description of security is qualified in its entirety by the Loan Security Agreements, filed as Exhibits 10.2 through 10.6 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Senior Secured Second-Priority Notes due 2014
Overview
On May 1, 2009 (the "Closing Date"), Seagate Technology International (the "Issuer"), an exempted limited liability company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and an indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $430 million in aggregate principal amount of 10.00% Senior Secured Second-Priority Notes due 2014 (the "Notes"), which mature on May 1, 2014, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of May 1, 2009 (the "Indenture"), among the Issuer, the Company, the other guarantors party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
Interest on the Notes will be payable in cash. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on November 1, 2009, to holders of record of the Notes on April 15 or October 15 immediately preceding the interest payment date.
 
Indenture and Notes
The following is a brief description of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes. The above description of the Indenture and the Notes contained herein is qualified in its entirety by the Indenture and the form of 10.00% Senior Secured Second-Priority Note due 2014 (included in the Indenture), filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Guaranties
The obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, including any repurchase obligation resulting from a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a general, secured basis, by the Company and each of its existing and future, direct or indirect, wholly owned material subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that is a borrower under, or guarantees, the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Such guarantees are collectively referred to herein as the "Note Guaranties" and each, a "Note Guaranty." The Company and such subsidiary guarantors are collectively referred to herein as the "Guarantors," and the Guarantors that guaranteed the Notes as of the Closing Date are collectively referred to herein as the "Initial Guarantors").
Each Note Guaranty is limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantors' obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of state or foreign law.
The Note Guaranty of a Guarantor (other than the Company) will automatically terminate and be released upon:
(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indenture)) otherwise permitted by the Indenture;
(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Guarantor of obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement or such other guarantee that resulted in the creation of such guarantee except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee, that (a) the aggregate amount of borrowings and available commitments under the senior secured credit facility, after giving effect to such release, is at least $200 million (the "Minimum Size Credit Facility"), (b) the aggregate fair market value of collateral owned by Guarantors released pursuant to this clause (2) on and after May 1, 2009 (in each case measured at the date of release and as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the Company) after giving effect to any such release does not exceed 30% of the aggregate fair market value of the collateral immediately prior to such release and (c) the collateral owned by Guarantors released pursuant to this clause (2) may not consist of substantially all of the collateral relating to any facility, line of business or division that generated, in the four quarters immediately prior to the proposed release thereof for which financial reports have been provided as required under the Indenture, more than 15% of the EBITDA (as defined in the Indenture) of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries;
provided
(3) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of such Guarantor as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" (as such term is defined in the Indenture); or
(4) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in the Indenture.
Ranking
The Notes are general secured obligations of the Issuer and rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future debt of the Issuer that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and in right of payment with all existing and future debt of the Issuer that is not so subordinated, effectively senior to all unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt and effectively junior to any obligations of the Issuer that are either (1) secured by a lien on the collateral that is senior or prior to the second-priority liens securing the Notes, including the first-priority liens securing obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, and, potentially, certain permitted liens under the Indenture, or (2) secured by assets that are not part of the collateral securing the Notes, in each case to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
pari passu
 
The Note Guaranties are general secured obligations of the Guarantors and rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future debt of the Guarantors that is, by its terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guaranties and in right of payment with all existing and future debt of the Guarantors that is not so subordinated, effectively senior to all unsecured debt of the Guarantors to the extent of the value of the collateral and effectively junior to any obligations of any Guarantor that are either (1) secured by a lien on the collateral that is senior or prior to the second-priority liens securing the Note Guaranties, including the first-priority liens securing obligations of the Guarantors under the Amended Credit Agreement, and, potentially, certain permitted liens under the Indenture, or (2) secured by assets that are not part of the collateral securing the Notes, in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
pari passu
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have not guaranteed and will not guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders, if any, of those subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company, the Issuer and the other Guarantors, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guaranty therefore is effectively subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred and minority stockholders, if any, of subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Issuer and the Guarantors).
Release of Liens
The second-priority liens (described under "Security" below) securing the Note Guaranty of any Guarantor will be automatically released when such Guarantor's Note Guaranty is released in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In addition, the second-priority liens securing the Notes will be automatically released:
(1) upon discharge or defeasance of the Notes as set forth in the Indenture;
(2) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes issued under the Indenture;
(3) with the consent of the requisite holders of the Notes in accordance with the provisions under the Indenture, including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, Notes;
(4) in connection with any disposition of collateral to any person other than the Company, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any consolidation, merger or sale of assets transaction, where the recipient is required to become the obligor on the Notes or a Guarantor) that is permitted by the Indenture (with respect to the lien on such collateral);
(5) upon the sale or disposition of any collateral pursuant to the exercise of any rights and remedies by the Administrative Agent with respect to any collateral securing the first-priority lien obligations or the commencement or prosecution of enforcement by the holders of first-priority lien obligations of any of the rights and remedies under the documents governing the first-priority lien obligations or applicable law, including without limitation the exercise of any rights of set-off or recoupment; and
(6) other than in connection with an enforcement action, upon the release or discharge of the first-priority liens securing obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement or any guarantees thereof on any collateral (with respect to the lien on such collateral); that (a) the senior secured credit facility is a Minimum Size Credit Facility, (b) the aggregate fair market value of collateral released pursuant to this clause (6) on and after May 1, 2009 (in each case measured at the date of release and as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the Company) after giving effect to any such release does not exceed 30% of the aggregate fair market value of the collateral immediately prior to such release and (b) the collateral released pursuant to this clause (6) may not consist of substantially all of the collateral relating to any facility, line of business or division that generated, in the four quarters immediately prior to the proposed release thereof for which financial reports have been provided as required under the Indenture, more than 15% of EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
provided
 
Optional Redemption
At any time and from time to time prior to May 1, 2013, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the greater of (1) 1.0% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of such Note on May 1, 2013 (as stated in the next paragraph below), plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such Note through May 1, 2013 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate as of such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over (b) the principal amount of such Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
At any time and from time to time on or after May 1, 2013, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium equal to one-half the annual coupon thereon and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
In addition, before May 1, 2012, the Issuer may, at its option on one or more occasions, redeem Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings by the Company, at a redemption price equal to 110% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); , that after giving effect to any such redemption (1) at least 65% of such aggregate principal amount of Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (other than Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or its affiliates) and (2) each such redemption occurs within 90 days after the date of the related equity offering by the Company.
provided, however
Repurchase of Notes upon a Change of Control
Not later than 30 days following a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture), the Company or the Issuer must make an offer to purchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
Other Covenants
The Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the Company's ability and the ability of its Restricted Subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The obligations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with certain of these restrictions will be suspended and cease to have any further effect from and after the first date when the corporate family rating of the Company is Investment Grade (as defined in the Indenture); that if the corporate family rating of the Company ceases to be Investment Grade, then, from and after such time, the obligation of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with the suspended covenants shall be reinstated.
provided
Events of Default
The Indenture also provides for customary events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.
Security
The Indenture provides that, subject to the provisions below, the Notes must be secured by second-priority liens granted by the Issuer, the Initial Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in the Collateral Jurisdictions (such Initial Guarantors, the "Initial Notes Grantors"), and future material Guarantors organized, or with material assets located, in the Collateral Jurisdictions (such future Guarantors, together with the Initial Notes Grantors, the "Notes Grantors") on substantially all assets of the Issuer and the Notes Grantors (whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired) and subject to certain permitted liens, including without limitation:
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing:
 
 
that the Issuer and the Guarantors are required to execute such local law documentation, and pledge such assets to the extent that the Issuer and the Guarantors execute such documentation or pledge such assets for the benefit of the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement.
provided
Upon an enforcement event or insolvency proceeding, proceeds from the collateral will be applied first to satisfy obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and certain other first-priority obligations, and then to satisfy obligations on the Notes.
Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes on the Closing Date, the Issuer, certain of the Initial Guarantors and the Trustee, in its capacity as the collateral agent (the "Collateral Agent") entered into, among others, the following security agreements (collectively, the "Notes Security Agreements") providing for second-priority liens securing the Notes:
 
 
 
 
As required by the Indenture, pursuant to the Notes Security Agreements, the Issuer's obligations under the Notes are secured by second-priority liens granted by the Issuer and the Initial Notes Grantors organized, or with material assets located, in the Cayman Islands and the United States of America (including any State thereof and the District of Columbia) on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets, subject to certain permitted liens. Second-priority liens over additional assets shall not be required to be granted until such time as such assets are required to have become collateral security under the Amended Credit Agreement (taking into account any waivers or extensions granted by the Administrative Agent thereunder); that the senior secured credit facility is a Minimum Size Credit Facility. If the senior secured credit facility is not a Minimum Size Credit Facility, then required grants of second-priority liens shall be required to be made within the time period specified in the Indenture.

The Collateral Agent is not permitted to enforce the security interests even if any event of default under the Indenture has occurred and the Notes have been accelerated, with limited exceptions. The holders of the first-priority liens will receive all proceeds from any realization on the collateral or from the collateral or proceeds thereof in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, until the obligations secured by the first-priority liens are paid in full.

The principal amount of any Debt Incurred to refinance other Debt, if Incurred in a different currency from the Debt being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Debt is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Guarantors
Administrative Agent
Reference is made to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 3, 2009 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""), among the Borrower, Intermediate Holdings, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the "") and the Administrative Agent. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
Lenders
The Lenders have agreed to make Loans to the Borrower, and the Issuing Banks have agreed to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement. Each of Intermediate Holdings and each Subsidiary acknowledges that it will derive substantial benefit from the making of the Loans by the Lenders and the issuance of Letters of Credit by the Issuing Banks. The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit are conditioned on, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Guarantors of a Guarantee Agreement in the form hereof. As consideration therefor and in order to induce the Lenders to make Loans and the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit, the Guarantors are willing to execute this Agreement.
Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
SECTION 1. . Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the Obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation.
Guarantee
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, no Obligation of any U.S. Loan Party shall be required to be Guaranteed by any CFC Subsidiary or any Qualified CFC Holding Company, in each case of any U.S. Subsidiary.
SECTION 2. . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the Borrower or any other Guarantor under the provisions of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise, (b) any rescission, waiver (except the effect of any waiver obtained pursuant to Section 12(b)), amendment or modification of, or any release from any terms or provisions of any other Loan Document, any other Guarantee or any other agreement (in each case pursuant to the terms thereof), including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement, or (c) the failure to perfect any security interest in, or release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party.
Obligations Not Waived
SECTION 3. . Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each of the other Secured Parties to (a) take and hold security for the payment of its guarantee hereunder and the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, (b) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as they in their sole discretion may determine and (c) release or substitute any one or more endorsees, other Guarantors or other obligors.
Security
SECTION 4. . Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any of the security held for payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the Borrower or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment
SECTION 5. . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Obligations, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, by any waiver or
No Discharge or Diminishment of Guarantee
 
modification of any provision of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations, or the failure to perfect any security interest in, or the release of, any of the security held by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, or by any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations).
SECTION 6. . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower, other than the final payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations (or, in the case of an action seeking payment of less than all the Loan Document Obligations, payment in full in cash of the portion of the Loan Document Obligations sought in such action). The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with the Borrower or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against the Borrower or any other Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Pursuant to applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or guarantor, as the case may be, or any security.
Defenses of Borrower Waived
SECTION 7. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party as designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligations. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party as provided above, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or such other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.
Agreement to Pay; Subordination
 
SECTION 8. . Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each Loan Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties will have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Information
SECTION 9. . Each Guarantor represents and warrants as to itself that all representations and warranties relating to it contained in the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects.
Representations and Warranties
SECTION 10. . The guarantees made hereunder (a) shall terminate when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full in cash, the Commitments have expired or been terminated, the principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable under the Loan Documents shall have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated (or otherwise provided for in a manner satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank) and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed and (b) shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Secured Party or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any Guarantor or otherwise. In the event that any Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary (as such term is used in the Credit Agreement) pursuant to a transaction permitted under the Credit Agreement, such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. Upon the release of a Guarantor from its obligations under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10, and at the sole expense of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor may reasonably request to evidence such termination or release.
Termination
SECTION 11. . Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Guarantors that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent, and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Collateral Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any such attempted assignment without such consent shall be void). This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.
Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments
 
SECTION 12. . (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder and of the other Secured Parties under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
Waivers; Amendment
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates and the Administrative Agent, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 13. . THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Notices

(a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Guarantors herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by the Secured Parties or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect until all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full in cash, the Commitments have expired or been terminated, the principal of and interest on each Loan and all fees payable under any Loan Document shall have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated (or otherwise provided for in a manner satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank) and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed.
Survival of Agreement; Severability
 
(b) In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
SECTION 16. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 11. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or Adobe .pdf transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(c) Each Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will, for each work covered by a material Copyright that it continues to publish, reproduce, display, adopt or distribute, provide appropriate copyright notice as necessary and sufficient to establish and preserve its maximum rights under applicable copyright laws pursuant to which each such Copyright is issued.

(h) Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor shall use its best efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals from the licensor of each Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License to effect the assignment of all of such Grantor's right, title and interest thereunder to the Administrative Agent or its designee, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall determine that any such assignment would result in the permanent destruction of the value or validity of such License or the Intellectual Property that is the subject of such License; , , that nothing in this sentence shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to make any such determination, and no action taken or permitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party with respect to such determination shall give rise to any defense, counterclaim or offset in favor of any Grantor or to any claim or action against the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party.
provided

simultaneous notice to the Borrower of its intent to begin taking actions under this Section 5.02; , , that any failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Administrative Agent's right, power or authority to take such actions. It is understood and agreed that the appointment of the Administrative Agent as the agent and attorney-in-fact of the Grantors for the purposes set forth above is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable. The provisions of this Section shall in no event relieve any Grantor of any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or impose any obligation on the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party to proceed in any particular manner with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof, or in any way limit the exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party of any other or further right that it may have on the date of this Agreement or hereafter, whether hereunder, under any other Loan Document, by law or otherwise.
provided
however
SECTION 6.01. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver each item of Collateral to the Administrative Agent on demand, and it is agreed that the Administrative Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Collateral by the applicable Grantors to the Administrative Agent, or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, any such Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall determine, except to the extent such assignment, transfer, conveyance or grant of a license or sublicense would result in the permanent destruction of the validity or value of the Intellectual Property that is the subject of such license and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the UCC or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate.

Remedies upon Default
 
Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Except as provided below, the Administrative Agent shall give prior or simultaneous notice to the Borrower of its intent to begin taking actions under this Section 6.01; , , that any failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Administrative Agent's right, power or authority to take such actions.

however
The Administrative Agent shall give the Grantors 10 days' written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agent's intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6.01, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor, except that any remaining proceeds thereof shall be delivered to the Grantors to the extent required by Section 6.02. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full in cash. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein
 
conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
SECTION 6.02. . The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:

SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
THIRD, to the Grantors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 6.03. . For the purpose of enabling the Administrative Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Article at such time as the Administrative Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Administrative Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantors) to use, license or sub-license any of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property (and all embodiments or fixations thereof and related documentation, registrations and franchises, and all additions, improvements and accessions to, and books and records describing or used in connection therewith) now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, except to the extent that the granting of such license would

The use of such license by the Administrative Agent shall be exercised, at the option of the Administrative Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, that any license, sub-license or other transaction entered into by the Administrative Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.

SECTION 5. . (a) Unless and until an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:
Voting Rights; Dividends and Interest, etc
(i) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and/or other consensual rights and powers inuring to an owner of Pledged Securities or any part thereof for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; , , that such Pledgor will not be entitled to exercise any such right if the result thereof could, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, materially impair the Collateral, or could materially and adversely affect the rights inuring to a holder, of the Pledged Securities or the rights and remedies of any of the Secured Parties under this Agreement or the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document or the ability of the Secured Parties to exercise the same.
provided

(ii) The Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to each Pledgor, or cause to be executed and delivered to each Pledgor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and to receive the cash dividends it is entitled to receive pursuant to subparagraph (iii) below.
(iii) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, interest and principal paid on the Pledged Securities to the extent and only to the extent that such cash dividends, interest and principal are permitted by, and otherwise paid in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and applicable laws. All noncash dividends, interest and principal, and all dividends, interest and principal paid or payable in cash or otherwise in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other than distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect of the Pledged Securities, whether paid or payable in cash or otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding capital stock of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Collateral, and, if received by any Pledgor, shall not be commingled by such Pledgor with any of its other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and shall be forthwith delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).
 
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of any Pledgor to dividends, interest or principal that such Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent, which shall, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (b), have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest or principal. All dividends, interest or principal received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith delivered to the Administrative Agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). Any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be retained by the Administrative Agent in an account to be established by the Administrative Agent upon receipt of such money or other property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 7. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the Administrative Agent shall promptly repay to each Pledgor all cash dividends, interest or principal (without interest), that such Pledgor would otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(iii) above and that remain in such account.
(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of any Pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 5, and the obligations of the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Administrative Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers, , unless otherwise directed by the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an Event of Default to permit the Pledgors to exercise such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, each Pledgor will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(i) above.
provided that
SECTION 6. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to applicable regulatory and legal requirements, the Administrative Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Administrative Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Pledgors hereby waive all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal any Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
Remedies upon Default
 
The Administrative Agent shall give a Pledgor 10 days' prior written notice (which each Pledgor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Administrative Agent's intention to make any sale of such Pledgor's Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Administrative Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Administrative Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the sale price is paid in full by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free from any right of redemption, stay or appraisal on the part of any Pledgor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to it from such Pledgor as a credit against the purchase price, and it may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such Pledgor therefor, except that any remaining proceeds thereof shall be delivered to the Pledgors to the extent required by Section 7. For purposes hereof, (a) a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof, (b) the Administrative Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and (c) such Pledgor shall not be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Administrative Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Administrative Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Collateral and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
 
SECTION 7. . The Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds of Sale
FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other Loan Document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Pledgor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties pro rata in accordance with the amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
THIRD, to the Pledgors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
The Administrative Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Administrative Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Administrative Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Administrative Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 8. . (a) Each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to pay upon demand to the Administrative Agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, other charges and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts or agents, that the Administrative Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder or (iv) the failure by such Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof applicable to it.
Reimbursement of Administrative Agent
(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, incurred by or asserted against any of them arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating hereto or to the Collateral, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
provided
 
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. The provisions of this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section 8 shall be payable on written demand therefor and shall bear interest at the rate payable under Section 2.12(c)(ii) of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 9. . Each Pledgor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent the attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, with full power of substitution either in the Administrative Agent's name or in the name of such Pledgor, to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of any Collateral, to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other instruments for the payment of money payable to the Pledgor representing any interest or dividend or other distribution payable in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof or on account thereof and to give full discharge for the same, to settle, compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim or proceeding with respect thereto, and to sell, assign, endorse, pledge, transfer and to make any agreement respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same; , , that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Administrative Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Administrative Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Administrative Agent shall give prior or simultaneous notice to the Borrower of its intent to begin taking actions under this Section 9; , , that any failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Administrative Agent's, right, power or authority to take such actions. The Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 10. . (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
Waivers; Amendment
 
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent hereunder and of the other Secured Parties under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Pledgor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Pledgor in any case shall entitle such Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor or Pledgors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement.
SECTION 11. . In view of the position of the Pledgors in relation to the Pledged Securities, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "") with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Securities permitted hereunder. Each Pledgor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Administrative Agent if the Administrative Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Securities could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Administrative Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Securities under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Pledgor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Administrative Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Pledged Securities, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Pledged Securities for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale, in either case in accordance with a valid exemption from registration under the Federal Securities Laws. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Administrative Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Securities at a price that the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might

have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this Section 11 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Administrative Agent sells.
SECTION 12. [Intentionally Omitted]
SECTION 13. . All rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder, the grant of a security interest in the Collateral and all obligations of each Pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (c) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to or departure from any guaranty, for all or any of the Obligations or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Pledgor in respect of the Obligations or in respect of this Agreement (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations).
Security Interest Absolute
SECTION 14. . (a) This Agreement and the security interests granted hereby shall terminate when all the Loan Document Obligations have been paid in full in cash, the Commitments have expired or been terminated, the principal and interest on each Loan and all fees payable under the Loan Documents shall have been paid in full, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated (or otherwise provided for in a manner satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank) and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed.
Termination or Release
(b) In the event that a Pledgor ceases to be a Subsidiary (as such term is used in the Credit Agreement) pursuant to a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents, such Pledgor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement and the Collateral of such Pledgor shall be released without further action.
(c) Upon any sale or other transfer by any Pledgor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement to any Person that is not a Pledgor, or, upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement, the security interest in such Collateral shall be automatically released.
(d) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 14, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Pledgor, at such Pledgor's expense, all documents that such Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 14 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
 
SECTION 15. Intentionally Omitted]
[
SECTION 16. . All communications and notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Subsidiary Pledgor shall be given to it at its address or telecopy number set forth on Schedule I hereto, with a copy to the Borrower.
Notices
SECTION 17. . Each Pledgor agrees to do such further acts and things, and to execute and deliver such additional conveyances, assignments, agreements and instruments, as the Administrative Agent may at any time reasonably request in connection with the administration and enforcement of this Agreement or with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or in order better to assure and confirm unto the Administrative Agent its rights and remedies hereunder.
Further Assurances
SECTION 18. . Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Pledgor that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of each party thereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall become effective as to any Pledgor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Pledgor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Pledgor and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Pledgor, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Pledgor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such attempted assignment shall be void), except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Pledgor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Pledgor without the approval of any other Pledgor and without affecting the obligations of any other Pledgor hereunder.
Binding Effect; Several Agreement; Assignments
SECTION 19. . (a) All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by each Pledgor herein and in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties and each Pledgor and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making by the Lenders of the Loans and the issuance of Letters of Credit by the Issuing Banks and, regardless of any investigation made by the Secured Parties or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect until this Agreement shall terminate pursuant to the first sentence of Section 14.
Survival of Agreement; Severability
 
(b) In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
SECTION 20. . THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
GOVERNING LAW
SECTION 21. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective as provided in Section 18. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or Adobe .pdf transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(b) Each Pledgor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 23.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
SECTION 25. . Pursuant to Section 5.12 of the Credit Agreement and the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement, (a) each U.S. Loan Party that is formed or acquired after the Second Restatement Effective Date and (b) each other Loan Party that is formed or acquired after the Second Restatement Effective Date that owns Equity Interests in a Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of the United States of America (including any State thereof and the District of Columbia) that would constitute Collateral if such Subsidiary Loan Party were a party hereto, in each case is required to enter into this Agreement as a Subsidiary Pledgor upon becoming a Subsidiary Loan Party.

Credit Agreement
Lenders
U.S. Guarantee Agreement
The Lenders have agreed to make Loans to the Borrower, and the Issuing Banks have agreed to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, pursuant to, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions specified in, the Credit Agreement. The Guarantors have guaranteed the Obligations pursuant to the U.S. Guarantee Agreement. Certain Guarantors have granted Liens on and security interests in certain of their assets to secure such guarantees pursuant to (a) the U.S. Pledge Agreement and (b) the U.S. Security Agreement, and certain other Guarantors have granted Liens on and security interests in certain of their assets to secure such guarantees pursuant to certain other Security Documents. The obligations of the Lenders to make Loans and of the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit are conditioned on, among other things, the execution and delivery by the Borrower and the Guarantors of an agreement in the form hereof.
Accordingly, the Borrower, each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent agree as follows:
SECTION 1. In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 3), the Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under the U.S. Guarantee Agreement, the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy a claim of any Secured Party, the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.

SECTION 2. Each Guarantor (a "") agrees (subject to Section 3) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under the U.S. Guarantee Agreement or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy a claim of any Secured Party and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrower as provided in Section 1, the Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 12, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 2 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section 1 to the extent of such payment.
Contribution and Subrogation.
Contributing Guarantor

SECTION 3. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of each of the Guarantors under Sections 1 and 2 and all other rights of each of the Guarantors in respect of indemnity, contribution or subrogation from any other Loan Party under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Loan Document Obligations that are then due and payable whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. No failure on the part of the Borrower or any other Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 1 and 2 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.

In the event that a Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary (as such term is used in the Credit Agreement) pursuant to a transaction permitted under the Loan Documents or, such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under this Agreement without further action. Upon release of a Guarantor from its obligations under this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4, and at the sole expense of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor may reasonably

request to evidence such termination or release. This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Secured Party or any Guarantor upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any Guarantor or otherwise.
SECTION 5. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
GOVERNING LAW.
SECTION 6. (a) No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Guarantor to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy by the Administrative Agent or any Guarantor preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Grantor, and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that such Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Except as provided below, the Collateral Agent shall give prior or simultaneous notice to the Issuer of its intent to begin taking actions under this Section 6.01; , , that any failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Collateral Agent's right, power or authority to take such actions.
provided
however
The Collateral Agent shall give the Grantors 10 days' written notice (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6.01, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any Obligation then due and payable to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to any Grantor therefor, except that any remaining proceeds thereof shall be delivered to the Grantors to the extent required by Section 6.02. For purposes hereof, subject, in each case, to the Intercreditor Agreement, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such
 
agreement and no Grantor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full in cash. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
SECTION 6.02. . Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds of Sale
FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other Indenture Document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Indenture Document on behalf of any Grantor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Indenture Document; and
SECOND, in the order set forth in Section 6.10 of the Indenture.
The Collateral Agent shall have, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 6.03. . For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Article at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to the Grantors) to use, license or sub-license any of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property (and all embodiments or fixations thereof and related documentation, registrations and franchises, and all additions, improvements and accessions to, and books and records describing or used in connection therewith) now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, except to the extent that the granting of such license would (i) result in the permanent destruction of the validity or value of such Intellectual Property or (ii) violate the terms of any licensing agreements relating to such Intellectual
Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property
 
Property existing on the later of the date hereof and the date on which such Intellectual Property is acquired by a Grantor, that such Grantor and the Company have each used commercially reasonable efforts to remove or prevent the inclusion of such restrictions from the relevant license or sublicense, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. The use of such license by the Collateral Agent shall be exercised, at the option of the Collateral Agent, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, that any license, sub-license or other transaction entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Grantors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.

The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Grantor hereunder.

provided
however
(ii) If the Collateral Agent is the Perfection Agent at that time, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to each Pledgor, or cause to be executed and delivered to each Pledgor, all such proxies, powers of attorney and other instruments as such Pledgor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Pledgor to exercise the voting and/or consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and to receive the cash dividends it is entitled to receive pursuant to subparagraph (iii) below.
(iii) Each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, interest and principal paid on the Pledged Securities to the extent and only to the extent that such cash dividends, interest and principal are permitted by, and otherwise paid in accordance with, the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the other Indenture Documents and applicable laws. All noncash dividends, interest and principal, and all dividends, interest and principal paid or payable in cash or otherwise in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution, return of capital, capital surplus or paid-in surplus, and all other distributions (other than distributions referred to in the preceding sentence) made on or in respect of the Pledged Securities, whether paid or payable in cash or otherwise, whether resulting from a subdivision, combination or reclassification of the outstanding capital stock of the issuer of any Pledged Securities or received in exchange for Pledged Securities or any part thereof, or in redemption thereof, or as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such issuer may be a party or otherwise, shall be and become part of the Collateral, and, if received by any Pledgor, shall not be commingled by such Pledgor with any of its other funds or property but shall be held separate and apart therefrom, shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Collateral Agent and shall be forthwith delivered to the Perfection Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).
(b) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of any Pledgor to dividends, interest or principal that such Pledgor is authorized to receive pursuant to paragraph (a)(iii) above shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Perfection Agent, which shall, subject to the provisions
 
of this paragraph (b) and the Intercreditor Agreement, have the sole and exclusive right and authority to receive and retain such dividends, interest or principal. All dividends, interest or principal received by the Pledgor contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Perfection Agent, shall be segregated from other property or funds of such Pledgor and shall be forthwith delivered to the Perfection Agent upon demand in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). Except to the extent otherwise required by the Intercreditor Agreement, any and all money and other property paid over to or received by the Perfection Agent pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) shall be retained by the Perfection Agent in an account to be established by the Perfection Agent upon receipt of such money or other property and shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of Section 7. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, the Collateral Agent shall promptly repay to each Pledgor, but only to the extent received by the Collateral Agent as Perfection Agent, all cash dividends, interest or principal (without interest), that such Pledgor would otherwise be permitted to retain pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(iii) above and that remain in such account.
(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of any Pledgor to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 5, and the obligations of the Collateral Agent under paragraph (a)(ii) of this Section 5, shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, become vested in the Collateral Agent, which shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to exercise such voting and consensual rights and powers, that, unless otherwise directed by the Noteholders, the Collateral Agent shall have the right from time to time following and during the continuance of an Event of Default to permit the Pledgors to exercise such rights. After all Events of Default have been cured or waived, each Pledgor will have the right to exercise the voting and consensual rights and powers that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a)(i) above.
provided
SECTION 6. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to applicable regulatory and legal requirements and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of any Pledgor, and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Pledgors hereby waive all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal any Pledgor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
Remedies upon Default
 
The Collateral Agent shall give a Pledgor 10 days' prior written notice (which each Pledgor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of such Pledgor's Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid in full by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 6, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free from any right of redemption, stay or appraisal on the part of any Pledgor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any Secured Obligation then due and payable to it from such Pledgor as a credit against the purchase price, and it may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to such Pledgor therefor, except that any remaining proceeds thereof shall be delivered to the Pledgors to the extent required by Section 7. For purposes hereof, subject in each case to the Intercreditor Agreement, (a) a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof, (b) the Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and (c) such Pledgor shall not be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Secured Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose upon the Collateral and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver.
 
SECTION 7. . Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall apply the proceeds of any collection or sale of the Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds of Sale
FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such hereunder or under any other Indenture Document) in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the reasonable fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Indenture Document on behalf of any Pledgor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Indenture Document; and
SECOND, in the order set forth in Section 6.10 of the Indenture.
The Collateral Agent shall have, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of the Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 8. . (a) Each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to pay upon demand to the Collateral Agent the amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees, other charges and disbursements of its counsel and of any experts or agents, that the Collateral Agent may incur in connection with (i) the administration of this Agreement, (ii) the custody or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, (iii) the exercise, enforcement or protection of any of the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder or (iv) the failure by such Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof applicable to it.
Reimbursement of Collateral Agent
(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Indenture Documents, each Pledgor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the other Indemnitees against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel, incurred by or asserted against any of them arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating hereto or to the Collateral, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
provided
 
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. The provisions of this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Indenture Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Indenture Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section 8 shall be payable on written demand therefor and shall bear interest at the rate per annum publicly announced by the Collateral Agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office on the date such written demand is made.
SECTION 9. . Each Pledgor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent the attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agent's name or in the name of such Pledgor, to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of any Collateral, to endorse checks, drafts, orders and other instruments for the payment of money payable to the Pledgor representing any interest or dividend or other distribution payable in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof or on account thereof and to give full discharge for the same, to settle, compromise, prosecute or defend any action, claim or proceeding with respect thereto, and to sell, assign, endorse, pledge, transfer and to make any agreement respecting, or otherwise deal with, the same; , , that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent shall give prior or simultaneous notice to the Issuer of its intent to begin taking actions under this Section 9; , , that any failure to give such notice shall in no way affect the Collateral Agent's, right, power or authority to take such actions. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Pledgor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

SECTION 10. . (a) No failure or delay of the Collateral Agent in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
Waivers; Amendment
 
the Collateral Agent hereunder and of the other Secured Parties under the other Indenture Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provisions of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Pledgor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Pledgor in any case shall entitle such Pledgor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to a written agreement entered into between the Collateral Agent and the Pledgor or Pledgors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification relates, subject to any consent required in accordance with Article 9 of the Indenture.
SECTION 11. . In view of the position of the Pledgors in relation to the Pledged Securities, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "") with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Securities permitted hereunder. Each Pledgor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Collateral Agent if the Collateral Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Securities, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Securities could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Collateral Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Securities under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Pledgor recognizes that in light of such restrictions and limitations the Collateral Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Pledged Securities, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Pledged Securities for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Securities or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale, in either case in accordance with a valid exemption from registration under the Federal Securities Laws. Each Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Securities at a price that the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of this
Securities Act, etc

Section 11 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Collateral Agent sells.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to impose any duty on the First Priority Representative (or any third party acting on its behalf) with respect to such Common Collateral or provide the Second Priority Representative or any other Second Priority Secured Party with any rights with respect to such Common Collateral beyond those specified in this Agreement and the Second Priority
 
Security Documents, that as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of the First Priority Obligations Payment Date, the First Priority Representative shall (i) deliver to the Second Priority Representative, at the Borrower's sole cost and expense, the Common Collateral in its possession or control together with any necessary endorsements to the extent required by the Second Priority Documents or (ii) direct and deliver such Common Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise directs; , , that the provisions of this Agreement are intended solely to govern the respective Lien priorities as between the First Priority Secured Parties and the Second Priority Secured Parties and shall not impose on the First Priority Secured Parties any obligations in respect of the disposition of any Common Collateral (or any proceeds thereof) that would conflict with prior perfected Liens or any claims thereon in favor of any other Person that is not a Secured Party. The Loan Parties shall take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by the Second Priority Representative to effectuate the transfer of the Common Collateral upon the occurrence of the First Priority Obligations Payment Date to the Second Priority Representative contemplated hereby.

Such notice from the Second Priority Representative shall be irrevocable. If the Second Priority Representative does not exercise such right within 30 days after the first date on which a Purchase Event occurs, the First Priority Representative and the First Priority Creditors shall have no further obligations pursuant to this Section 5.12 for such Purchase Event and may take any further actions in their sole discretion in accordance with this Agreement and the other First Priority Documents.
