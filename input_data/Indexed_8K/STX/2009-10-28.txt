On October 26, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") revised the funding targets to be used for calculating annual bonus awards to each of the executive officers of Seagate Technology ("Seagate" or the "Company") for fiscal year 2010 under Seagate's Executive Officer Performance Bonus Plan (EPB).  As part of the Company's management of overall operating expenses, the Compensation Committee revised downward the funding of the EPB from the levels originally approved by the Compensation Committee on July 29, 2009 and disclosed on the Company's Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2009.  Specifically, the maximum funding level under the EPB for fiscal year 2010 is approximately 135% (reduced from 200%) of the target funding level.  Additionally, the overall reduction in funding levels will result in a reduction of approximately 50% of bonus funding with respect to the previously disclosed target bonus levels for the Company's senior executive officers (Stephen J. Luczo, Patrick O'Malley, Robert W. Whitmore, William D. Mosley and D. Kurt Richarz), who were included as the Named Executive Officers in the Company's fiscal year 2009 proxy statement.
 
 
On October 28, 2009, at the Company's 2009 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, the Company's shareholders approved an increase in the common shares available for purchase under Seagate Technology's Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the amount of 10 million shares.
 
In addition, in light of the recent increase in the Company's share price since the announcement of a proposed employee stock option exchange program (the "Exchange Program") and other considerations, the Company decided not to move forward with the Exchange Program at this time, and the Exchange Program proposal accordingly was not submitted for shareholder approval.
