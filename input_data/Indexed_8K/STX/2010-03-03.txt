At any time on or after the Enforcement Date the power of sale and all other powers conferred on mortgagees by law (including by the Act) shall be exercisable immediately without any requirement:

for the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 100(1) of the Act; or

The Administrative Agent shall not be obliged to obtain the consent of the Chargor or an order for possession under Sections 97 or 98 of the Act in order to enter into possession of the Security Assets or any part thereof.  The rights of the Administrative Agent under this clause are without prejudice to and in addition to any right of possession (express or implied) to which it is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by virtue of this Deed, operation of law, contract or otherwise).

During the Security Period the Administrative Agent may:
 
(a)
                                 
refrain from applying or enforcing any other monies, security or rights held or received by the Administrative Agent (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of the Secured Obligations, or apply and enforce the same in such manner
and order as it sees fit (whether against the Secured Obligations or otherwise) and the Chargor shall not be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

26.7
                        
If this Security is enforced at a time when no amount is due under theLoan Documents but at a time when amounts may or will become due, the Administrative Agent (or the Receiver) may pay the proceeds of any recoveries effected by it into such number of interest-bearing suspense accounts as it considers appropriate.
 
26.8

be subrogated to any rights, security or monies held, received or receivable by any Secured Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf);
 
(b)
                                
be entitled to any right of contribution or indemnity in respect of any payment made or monies received on account of the Chargor's liability under this clause.

26.12
                  
The Chargor waives any present or future right of set-off it may have in respect of its Secured Obligations (including sums payable by the Chargor under this Deed).

combine or consolidate all or any of the Chargor's then existing accounts wheresoever located (including accounts in the name of the Secured Parties or of the Chargor jointly with others) whether such accounts are current, deposit, loan or of any other nature whatsoever, whether they are subject to notice or not and whether they are denominated in euro or in any other currency; and/or

the full amount of the Secured Obligations in each currency in which they are for the time being denominated provided that if and to the extent that the Chargor shall not pay such amount in such currency the
Collateral Agent
may accept payment of all or part of such amount in any other currency and/or require the Chargor, in substitution for its liability to pay such amount in such currency, to pay an amount in euro which is equivalent to the amount of such currency remaining unpaid (and in either case the provisions of clause

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time after the Enforcement Date or if a demand is made for the payment of the Secured Obligations, the power of sale and any other power conferred on a mortgagee by law as varied or extended by this Deed will become immediately exercisable.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time after the Enforcement Date or if a demand is made for the payment of the Secured Obligations,
the power of sale and all other powers conferred on mortgagees by law (including by the Act) shall be exercisable immediately without any requirement:

The rights of the Collateral Agent under this clause are without prejudice to and in addition to any right of possession (express or implied) to which it is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by virtue of this Deed, operation of law, contract or otherwise).

18.6

refrain from applying or enforcing any other monies, security or rights held or received by the Collateral Agent (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of the Secured Obligations, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against the Secured Obligations or otherwise) and the Chargor shall not be entitled to the benefit of the same; and

The Chargor shall hold in trust for and shall immediately pay or transfer to the Collateral Agent for the Secured Parties or in accordance with any directions given by the Collateral Agent under this clause any payment or distribution or benefit of security received by it contrary to this clause.

taking any action permitted by this Deed; or

(a)
                                 
combine or consolidate all or any of the Chargor's then existing accounts wheresoever located (including accounts in the name of the Secured Parties or of the Chargor jointly with others) whether such accounts are current, deposit, loan or of any other nature whatsoever, whether they are subject to notice or not and whether they are denominated in euro or in any other currency; and/or
 
(b)
                                
after the occurrence of an Event of Default set-off or transfer any sum standing to the credit of any one or more such accounts in or towards the satisfaction of any Secured Obligations of the Chargor, any amount or other obligation owing by the Collateral Agent to the Chargor, whether such liabilities be present, future, actual or contingent, primary or collateral, several or joint or matured or not.
 
Where such combination, set-off or transfer requires the conversion of one currency into another, such conversion shall be calculated at the then prevailing spot rate of exchange of the relevant Secured Party (as conclusively determined by that Secured Party) for purchasing the currency required with the other currency.

(b)
                                
If a Secured Party does not open a new account, it will nevertheless be deemed to have done so at the time when it received or was deemed to have received notice of that charge or other interest.

As from that time all payments made to that Secured Party will be credited or will be deemed to be credited to the new account and will not operate to reduce any Secured Obligation.
 
28.2
        
Without prejudice to any right of set-off any Secured Party may have under this Deed, any Indenture Document or otherwise, if any time deposit matures on any account the Chargor has with any Secured Party within the Security Period when:

this Security has become enforceable; and
 
(b)
          
no Secured Obligation is due and payable,
 
that time deposit will automatically be renewed for any further maturity which that Secured Party in its absolute discretion considers appropriate unless that Secured Party otherwise agrees in writing.
 
28.3
        
(a)

(a)
          
any reconstruction, reorganisation or change in the constitution of any Secured Party;

the acquisition of all or any part of the undertaking of any Secured Party by any other person; or

The rights, powers and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers and remedies provided by law and may be exercised from time to time and as often as the Administrative Agent may deem expedient; and
(d)

Any settlement or discharge under this Mortgage between the Administrative Agent and the Mortgagor shall be conditional upon no security or payment to the Administrative Agent by the Company or the Mortgagor or any other person (including, without limitation, any Other Guarantor) being avoided or set aside or ordered to be refunded or reduced by virtue of any provision or enactment relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or liquidation for the time being in force and, if such condition is not satisfied, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to enforce this Mortgage as if such settlement or discharge had not been made, provided that such settlement or discharge shall become unconditional six months and one day after the date of such settlement or discharge.
 
6.3
                                
The rights of the Administrative Agent under this Mortgage and the security hereby constituted shall not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this provision, might operate to impair, affect or discharge such rights and security, in whole or in part, including without limitation, and whether or not known to or discoverable by the Company, the Mortgagor, the Administrative Agent or any other person:

(c)
                                 
cause or permit anything to be done which may depreciate, jeopardise or otherwise prejudice the value of the security hereby given.
 
6.7
                              
The Mortgagor hereby covenants that during the Security Period it will remain the legal and beneficial owner of the Mortgaged Property (subject to the Security Interests hereby created) and that it will not (other than as permitted by the Loan Documents):

The Mortgagor shall ensure that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, use its voting rights to permit the Company to amend its memorandum or articles of association in a way which could be expected to adversely affect the interests of the Administrative Agent or any of the Secured Parties.
 
6.10

Provision

ARTICLE 1
 
Section 1.01.           . 
Supplemental Indenture
This Supplemental Indenture is supplemental to, and is entered into in accordance with Section 10.01 of the Indenture, and except as expressly modified, amended and supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, all the terms, conditions and provisions of the Indenture are in all respects ratified and confirmed and shall remain in full force and effect.

Definitions
 
"" shall mean the guarantee by HDD, as authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Supplemental Indenture, which guarantee is set forth in Article 3 of this Supplemental Indenture.
HDD Guarantee
 
Section 2.01.           .  Pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Indenture, the Successor Company, as purchaser of substantially all of the properties and assets of HDD, expressly assumes all of the obligations of HDD under the Notes and the Indenture.
Assumption of Obligations under Indenture and Notes

Pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Indenture, the Successor Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, HDD as the issuer under the Indenture with the same effect as if the Successor Company had been named as "the Company" in the Indenture, and thereafter, HDD shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the Notes.
Successor Company Substituted
Section 3.01.           .  HDD hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns:
Additional Guarantee of HDD
 
(a) the full and punctual payment of principal of, premium (if any) on and interest on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Successor Company under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and the Notes; and

HDD Guaranteed Obligations
 
HDD further agrees that the HDD Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from HDD and that HDD will remain bound under this Article 3 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any HDD Guaranteed Obligation.
 
HDD waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Successor Company of any of the HDD Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment.  HDD waives notice of any default under the Notes or the HDD Guaranteed Obligations.  The obligations of HDD hereunder or under the Indenture shall not be affected by:
 
(i) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Successor Company or any other Person under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture or the Notes or any other agreement or otherwise;
 
(ii) any extension or renewal of any thereof;

(vi) except as set forth in Section 3.05 of this Supplemental Indenture, any change in the ownership of HDD.
 
HDD further agrees that the HDD Guarantee herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right
 
to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the HDD Guaranteed Obligations.
 
Except as expressly set forth in Section 9.02 of the Indenture, the obligations of HDD hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the HDD Guaranteed Obligations, this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture, the Notes or otherwise.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of HDD herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture, the Notes or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of HDD or would otherwise operate as a discharge of HDD as a matter of law or equity.
 
HDD further agrees that the HDD Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or premium (if any) on or interest on any HDD Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Successor Company or otherwise.
 
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against HDD by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Successor Company to pay the principal of or premium (if any) on or interest on any HDD Guaranteed Obligation or to perform or comply with any other HDD Guaranteed Obligation, HDD hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such HDD Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such HDD Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary HDD Guaranteed Obligations of the Successor Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
 
HDD further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the HDD Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of the HDD Guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the HDD Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such HDD Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such HDD Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by HDD for the purposes of this Section 3.01.
 
HDD also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 3.01.
 
Section 3.02.           .  This Article 3 shall be binding upon HDD and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Supplemental Indenture, the Indenture and in the Notes shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture.
Successors and Assigns
 
Section 3.03.           .  Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 3 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege.  The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 3 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver
 
Section 3.04.           .  No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 3, nor the consent to any departure by HDD therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  No notice to or demand on HDD in any case shall entitle HDD to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Modification
 
Section 3.05.           .  If HDD and the Successor Company merge with each other or consolidate together in a transaction permitted by Sections 4.01 and 4.02 of the Indenture, then the HDD Guarantee shall automatically be terminated upon the consummation of such merger or consolidation and shall no longer have any effect from such time without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.  At the request of HDD or the Successor Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such termination.
Release of Company Guarantor and Termination of Company Guarantee
 
Section 3.06.           .  HDD hereby agrees that the HDD Guarantee set forth in Section 3.01 of this Supplemental Indenture shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the absence of the endorsement of any notation of such Company Guarantee on the Notes.

Effective Date
