Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
As previously disclosed on February 1, 2010, Seagate Technology ("Seagate" or the "Company") decided to move its place of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Ireland pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the "Scheme of Arrangement") under Cayman Islands law, which, upon effectiveness, will result in a newly formed Irish public limited company ("Seagate-Ireland") serving as the publicly traded parent of the Seagate group of companies.
 
On April 14, 2010, Seagate held a special court-ordered meeting of its common shareholders (the "Special Scheme Meeting") and an extraordinary general meeting of its common shareholders (the "Extraordinary General Meeting") as described in the proxy statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 5, 2010 (the "Proxy Statement"). A quorum was present at both the Special Scheme Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting as required by the Company's memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law. The following is a brief description of each matter voted upon at each of the Special Scheme Meeting and the Extraordinary General Meeting and a statement of the number of votes cast for or against and the number of abstentions with respect to each matter.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereto duly authorized.
