On June 25, 2010, Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc. ("STUS"), a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Seagate Technology, gave notice to holders of its 5.75% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due March 2012 (the "5.75% Notes") and its 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due August 2012 (the "2.375% Notes") that it will call for redemption the entire $33,159,000 outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Notes and the entire $326,000,000 outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.375% Notes.  The 5.75% Notes will be redeemed for cash on July 27, 2010 at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The 2.375% Notes will be redeemed for cash on August 20, 2010 at a redemption price equal to 100.68% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
 
On and after the applicable redemption date, the 5.75% Notes and the 2.375% Notes will no longer be deemed outstanding, interest will cease to accrue thereon, and all rights of the holders of the 5.75% Notes and the 2.375% Notes, other than the right to receive the applicable redemption price, will cease.
