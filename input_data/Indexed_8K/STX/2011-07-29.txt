On July 27, 2011, John W. Thompson informed the Board of Directors that he will not stand for reelection at the Company's 2011 Annual General Meeting on October 26, 2011.  Mr. Thompson will continue to serve as a director and member of the Compensation Committee through October 26, 2011.

Executive Officer Performance Bonus Plan:  FY2012 Funding Levels
 
On July 27, 2011, the Compensation Committee authorized the performance metrics and funding targets to be used for calculating annual bonus awards to each of the Company's executive officers for fiscal year 2012 under the Executive Officer Performance Bonus Plan ("EPB"). The maximum funding level under the EPB for fiscal year 2012 is 200% of the target funding level. The funding of the EPB is determined based on the Company's performance with respect to the following goals for fiscal year 2012: revenues and operating margin (defined as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and bonus, divided by revenues), multiplied by a weighted quality multiplier. The quality multiplier was retained as part of the funding mechanism for fiscal year 2012 because quality is considered to be a critical part of the Seagate's overall business performance.
 
The funded amount is allocated among eligible participants in the EPB based upon their base salary and their target bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary. The fiscal year 2012 target bonus levels, expressed as a percentage of base salary, for the Company's senior executive officers (Stephen J. Luczo, Patrick J. O'Malley, Albert A. Pimentel, William D. Mosley and Robert W. Whitmore) who will be included as the Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") in the Company's fiscal year 2011 proxy statement, are shown in the table below.
Each NEO is eligible to receive an annual bonus in the event that the EPB is funded for fiscal year 2012. Any bonus awarded to an NEO for fiscal year 2012 shall be subject to the Company's Compensation Recovery for Fraud or Misconduct Policy, which provides standards for recovering compensation from an executive officer where such compensation was based on incorrectly reported financial results due to the fraud or willful misconduct of such executive officer.
 
The salary levels for the NEOs for the 2012 fiscal year remain unchanged from current levels, as shown in the table above.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereto duly authorized.
