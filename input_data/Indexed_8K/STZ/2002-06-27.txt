ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS . Constellation Brands, Inc. released the following information on June 26, 2002: . CONSTELLATION'S FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 21 PERCENT ON 9 PERCENT NET SALES GROWTH FAIRPORT, NEW YORK, June 26, 2002 - Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ and STZ.B) today reported net income of $37 million for the first quarter ended May 31, 2002, an increase of 33 percent on a comparable basis (excluding amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for both periods) over net income for the first quarter ended May 31, 2001. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.40 compared to $0.33 for the same period a year ago, an increase of 21 percent on a comparable basis. Diluted earnings per share for the prior year first quarter before adoption of SFAS 142 were $0.28. Richard Sands, Constellation Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, said, "As investors have confidently come to expect from us, we delivered excellent results. We achieved 9% sales growth and a strong 21% earnings per share increase this quarter, demonstrating how we leverage top line performance into bottom line results." Sands added, "In an uncertain economic and investment environment, we take pride in producing at the highest level within a stable industry." ADOPTION OF SFAS 142 AND EITF NO. 01-09 The financial information in this press release reflects the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." In order to help investors better evaluate year over year performance, the Company has included financial information on a "comparable" basis, as if the adoption of SFAS 142 had occurred in the prior year. Unless otherwise noted, discussions in this release were prepared on a comparable basis. Also, beginning March 1, 2002, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-09, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of a Vendor's Products." As a result, the Company has reclassified certain promotional expenditures paid to distributors, retailers or consumers as a reduction of revenue and non-cash consideration as an increase to cost of product sold. The Company previously reported these expenses as selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior-period financial information has been reclassified to comply with this guidance. This reclassification does not affect operating income or net income. Additional historical financial information, adjusted to show effect of EITF 01-09, can be found on the Company's web site: www.cbrands.com. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Net sales reached $649 million for the three months ended May 31, 2002 ("First Quarter 2003"), a nine percent increase over the three months ended May 31, 2001 ("First Quarter 2002"). Net sales growth was driven primarily by increases in imported beer, the U.K. wholesale business and Ravenswood, which was acquired in July 2001. Excluding Ravenswood, net sales for First Quarter 2003 grew seven percent, in-line with the Company's internal growth targets. Gross profit for First Quarter 2003 was $175 million compared to $153 million in the prior year period. The improvement in gross profit was primarily related to increased imported beer sales, though partially offset by higher average imported beer costs; as well as sales of Ravenswood and a favorable mix of spirit sales towards higher margin products, particularly tequila. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $89 million for First Quarter 2003 versus $76 million for First Quarter 2002. The increase was due primarily to higher advertising costs for the imported beer portfolio and higher personnel costs to support the Company's growth. First Quarter 2003 selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of net sales, were 13.8 percent, compared to 12.8 percent for the same period a year ago. The increase resulted from higher average advertising and promotional costs and higher general operating expenses. Operating income increased $10 million to reach $86 million for First Quarter 2003, an increase of 13 percent. Equity income from Pacific Wine Partners, an equally owned joint venture with BRL Hardy, which commenced operations August 2001, was $3 million for First Quarter 2003. Led by Australian import Banrock Station and Blackstone from California, Pacific Wine Partners' shipments improved 57 percent versus the prior year, which was before Pacific Wine Partner's formation. Net interest expense for First Quarter 2003 declined $3 million to $27 million as a result of lower average borrowing rates and lower average debt levels. As a result of the above factors, net income and diluted earnings per share for First Quarter 2003 were $37 million and $0.40, compared to net income and diluted earnings per share of $28 million and $0.33, respectively, reported for First Quarter 2002. IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS RESULTS Imported beer and spirits net sales for First Quarter 2003 were $270 million, an increase of 12 percent versus First Quarter 2002. The increase resulted from 14 percent growth in imported beer sales and five percent growth in spirits. Imported beer growth resulted from both volume gains and a price increase on the Company's Mexican brands, which took effect March 1, 2002. Spirits net sales growth resulted primarily from a favorable mix towards higher priced products, particularly tequila. Operating income grew to $54 million in First Quarter 2003, an increase of 18 percent versus the comparable quarter last year. The growth in operating income was primarily the result of increased beer sales and a favorable mix of higher margin spirit products partially offset by increased advertising spending, particularly on imported beer, and general operating expenses. POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE RESULTS Net sales were $163 million for popular and premium wine for First Quarter 2003, a decline of two percent over First Quarter 2002. Branded sales increased slightly but were more than offset by declines in nonbranded sales, particularly concentrate and bulk wine sales. Operating income was down slightly as increased profits from branded sales were more than offset by lower profits from nonbranded sales. U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE RESULTS Net sales for First Quarter 2003 increased to $187 million, an increase of 11 percent compared to net sales reported for First Quarter 2002. Wholesale sales improved 15 percent as the business continues to gain market share by adding new accounts and increasing average delivery sizes. Branded sales grew three percent on strong table wine sales and ready-to-drink brands, K Ice and fcuk SPIRIT, partially offset by declines in cider sales. Operating income for First Quarter 2003 was relatively flat at $10 million as increased profit from the wholesale business was offset by increased investment behind several key wine and ready-to-drink brands and lower cider sales. FINE WINE RESULTS Fine wine net sales for First Quarter 2003 increased 40 percent to reach $35 million. The increase was due to the addition of Ravenswood. Excluding Ravenswood, fine wine sales declined eight percent on lower volume following on the heels of a robust Fourth Quarter 2002 (+32 percent). Fine wine depletions, shipments from distributors to retailers, excluding Ravenswood continued to grow in the mid teens for the quarter. As a result of the higher net sales, operating income increased 44 percent, reaching $12 million.
