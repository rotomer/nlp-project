ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Constellation Brands, Inc. released the following information on January 13, 2003: CONSTELLATION CONFIRMS DISCUSSIONS WITH AUSTRALIAN WINE PRODUCER BRL HARDY Fairport, New York, January 13, 2003 - Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ and STZ.B) today confirmed it is in discussions regarding a possible acquisition or merger with Australia's largest wine producer BRL Hardy (ASX: BRL). The two companies currently operate a successful joint venture, Pacific Wine Partners, which markets BRL Hardy wines in the U.S. Constellation Chairman and CEO Richard Sands said, "Discussions with BRL Hardy regarding a possible transaction are taking place, but we have not yet reached agreement on a structure or transaction value." Mr. Sands said, "Bringing together Constellation and BRL Hardy would create the world's largest wine business, with leading positions in the world's key wine markets. We would have a broader and more powerful wine portfolio to market worldwide, encompassing all price points and emphasizing the fastest growing category - 'New World' wines from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Chile. It would accelerate our overall growth rates, adding to Constellation's track record of generating excellent results and delivering shareholder value.
