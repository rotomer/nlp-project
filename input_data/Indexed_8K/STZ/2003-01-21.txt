- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. SCHEME CONSIDERATION 5.1 FORMS OF SCHEME CONSIDERATION (a) Subject to clause 5.1(b), the Scheme Consideration in respect of each Scheme Share is either: (i) a cash amount of A$10.50 (the "CASH CONSIDERATION"); or (ii) the number of New Constellation Shares calculated in accordance with clause 5.2 (the "SCRIP CONSIDERATION"). Each Scheme Shareholder is entitled to receive either Cash Consideration or Scrip Consideration in respect of each Scheme Share held by that Scheme Shareholder. The allocation of each Scheme Shareholder's entitlement to Scheme Consideration as between Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration will be determined in accordance with clause 5.3. (b) If the US Listing Conditions are not satisfied by the date which is 5 Business Days before the Scheme Meeting or the Australian Listing Condition is not satisfied by 8.00 am on the Second Court Date then, in accordance with the terms of the Share Scheme, all Scheme Shareholders will receive Cash Consideration whether or not they have elected to receive Scrip Consideration. 5.2 CALCULATION OF SCRIP CONSIDERATION Subject to clause 5.5 the Scrip Consideration is the number of New Constellation Shares for each Scheme Share given by the following formula: C x 10.50 N = ---------- where: P N is the number of New Constellation Shares to be issued as consideration for each Scheme Share; P is the Constellation Share Price in US$ provided that: (a) if the Constellation Share Price is below US$22.50, P is 22.50; and (b) if the Constellation Share Price is above US$27.50, P is 27.50; C is the average of the closing US$/A$ exchange rate as quoted by Bloomberg measured at midnight New York time for each full trading day in the Price Setting Period. 5.3 FORM OF SCHEME CONSIDERATION Subject to clause 5.1(b) the, form of Scheme Consideration to be paid to Scheme Shareholders will be determined in accordance with the following provisions of this clause 5.3: (a) each Scheme Shareholder who does not make an Election will receive Cash Consideration in respect of all of that Scheme Shareholder's Scheme Shares; (b) each Scheme Shareholder who makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Cash Consideration will receive that part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Cash Consideration;
(c) subject to clause 5.6, each Scheme Shareholder who makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration will receive: (i) such part of the Scheme Consideration to which that Scheme Shareholder is entitled as is ascertained in accordance with clause 5.4 in the form of Scrip Consideration; and (ii) the balance of the Scheme Consideration to which that Scheme Shareholder is entitled in the form of Cash Consideration. 5.4 ALLOCATION OF SCRIP CONSIDERATION (a) If the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation pursuant to Elections to receive Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration (a "SCRIP ELECTION") if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full is less than or equal to the Scrip Consideration Cap then each Scheme Shareholder who has made a Scrip Election in respect of some or all of that Scheme Shareholder's Scheme Shares will receive Scrip Consideration in respect of all of the Scheme Shares in respect of which the Scrip Election is made. (b) If the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation pursuant to Scrip Elections if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full exceeds the Scrip Consideration Cap then each Scheme Shareholder who has made a Scrip Election will receive Scrip Consideration in respect of such number of the Scheme Shares in respect of which the Scrip Election is made as is given by the following formula C x E S = ----- A where: S is the number of Scheme Shares in respect of which Scrip Consideration will be received by the Scheme Shareholder. C is the number of New Constellation Shares comprising the Scrip Consideration Cap. E is the number of Scheme Shares in respect of which a Scrip Election was made by the Scheme Shareholder. A is the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation to Scheme Shareholders if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full. 5.5 CONSTELLATION CDIS Where an Eligible Scheme Shareholder is entitled to Scrip Consideration in accordance with clause 5.3: (a) the number of New Constellation Shares which would otherwise be required to be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder will not be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder and will instead be issued to the Depositary to hold on trust for the Eligible Scheme Shareholder; and (b) Constellation Sub will cause to be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder10 Constellation CDIs for each New
Constellation Share to which the Eligible Scheme Shareholder would be entitled under clause 5.2. 5.6 FOREIGN SCHEME SHAREHOLDERS If a Foreign Scheme Shareholder makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration then: (a) the New Constellation Shares which would otherwise be required to be issued to the Foreign Scheme Shareholder will not be issued to the Foreign Scheme Shareholder and will instead be issued to a nominee appointed by Constellation; (b) Constellation will cause the nominee to offer for sale on the open market within 5 Business Days after the Implementation Date all of the New Constellation Shares issued to the nominee under this clause 5.6 in such manner, at such price and on such other terms as the nominee shall determine and to remit to Constellation the proceeds of sale (after deducting brokerage, taxes and other costs of sale) (the "PROCEEDS") ; and (c) Constellation will pay to each Foreign Shareholder such fraction of the Proceeds as is equal to the number of New Constellation Shares which would have been issued to the Foreign Shareholder but for the application of this clause 5.6 divided by the total number of New Constellation Shares issued to the nominee under this clause 5.6. 5.7 FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS If a fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share arises from the calculation of the Scheme Consideration in respect of a Scheme Shareholder, then any such fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of New Constellation Shares, as the case may be, and all fractional entitlements will be paid in the form of Cash Consideration. Any Cash Consideration payable under this clause 5.7 will be calculated by multiplying the fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share by the Constellation Share Price converted into Australian dollars using the exchange rate referred to in clause 5.2. 5.8 CURRENCY OF CASH CONSIDERATION All Cash Consideration payable to Scheme Shareholders other than any payments made pursuant to clause 5.6 must be paid by cheque drawn in Australian dollars. 5.9 JOINT HOLDERS In the case of Scheme Shares held in joint names: (a) any cheque required to be paid to Scheme Shareholders shall be payable to the joint holders and be forwarded to the holder whose name appears first in the Register on the Record Date; and (b) any stock certificates and uncertificated holding statements for Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs to be issued to Scheme Shareholders shall be issued in the names of the joint holders and forwarded to the holder whose name appears first in the Register as at the Record Date.

5. FIDUCIARY DUTIES If at any time during the No Solicitation Period BRL Hardy receives a bona fide Third Party Proposal which was not solicited by BRL Hardy and was not otherwise brought about as a result of any breach by BRL Hardy of its obligations under this Letter and the Board acting in good faith: (a) determines after consultation with its financial and legal advisers that such Third Party Proposal is a Superior Proposal or is a proposal made in good faith in order to bring about a Superior Proposal and which is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal by the party making the Third Party Proposal; (b) obtains a written opinion from Queen's Counsel or Senior Counsel practising in the field of corporate law in Australia to the effect that the directors of BRL Hardy must cause BRL Hardy to undertake any act or acts with respect to such Third Party Proposal which would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of this letter in order to discharge properly their fiduciary or statutory duties or to avoid a contravention of the law; and (c) provides a copy of the opinion referred to in (b) above to Constellation's Australian counsel under arrangements which preserve the legal professional privilege attaching to that opinion; then, subject to complying with its obligations under the paragraph 6 of this Letter, BRL Hardy may undertake the act or acts referred to in paragraph (b) above with respect to such unsolicited Third Party Proposal. If BRL Hardy either (i) receives from any Person in connection with a Third Party Proposal or (ii) pursuant to and in compliance with this Letter provides to any Person in connection with a Third Party Proposal, any correspondence, information or other written material ("Third Party Material"), BRL Hardy shall as promptly as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof provide to Constellation a copy of any such Third Party Material which has not previously been provided to Constellation. 6. RIGHT TO MATCH (a) If at any time during the No Solicitation Period, BRL Hardy receives a Superior Proposal from any Person, then prior to the Board approving or recommending such Superior Proposal or entering into any agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, BRL Hardy shall give Constellation notice in writing of its intention to do so, which notice must state that the BRL Hardy Board has resolved, subject only to compliance with this paragraph 6(a), to approve such Superior Proposal or an agreement providing for such Superior Proposal, specify the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, identify the Person making such Superior Proposal and be accompanied by a written copy of such Superior Proposal and any proposed agreement providing for such Superior Proposal. (b) Constellation shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time during the period of 3 Business Days following receipt by Constellation of the notice referred to in paragraph 6(a), to offer to amend the terms of the Transaction (a "Counterproposal"). (c) If Constellation makes a Counterproposal within the period referred to in paragraph 6(b) then during the 3 Business Days following receipt of the Counterproposal (the "Review Period") BRL Hardy and the Board shall review in good faith the Counterproposal. If the Board determines that BRL Hardy's acceptance of the Counterproposal would result in the Superior Proposal referred to in paragraph 6(a) ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal, then BRL Hardy and Constellation must enter into an amended agreement in relation to the Transaction reflecting the Counterproposal. (d) If Constellation does not make a Counterproposal or if at the end of the Review Period the Board, acting in good faith, determines after consultation with its financial and legal advisors that, after taking the Counterproposal into account, the Superior Proposal referred to in clause paragraph 6(a) remains a Superior Proposal and is required to be pursued by BRL Hardy in order for the Board to discharge properly their fiduciary or statutory duties or to avoid a contravention of the law, then BRL Hardy must announce through the Australian Stock Exchange that the BRL Hardy Board recommends the Superior Proposal to BRL Hardy shareholders and on making such announcement shall be entitled to pursue the Superior Proposal.
