Dear Shareholder and Option holder,
 
On 17 January 2003 your Board announced the proposal to merge BRL Hardy with Constellation Brands, our partner in the successful US based Pacific Wine Partners joint venture, since mid 2001.
 
The merger will result in the creation of a leading international wine and beverages company, with strong market positions in the key markets of Australia, North America and the United Kingdom.
 
Under the merger proposal, BRL Hardy shareholders can choose to receive the following forms of consideration in exchange for their BRL Hardy shares:
 
cash of $10.50 per share;
 -      
Constellation Scrip; or
 -      
a combination of cash and Constellation Scrip.
 -      
 
Details of the precise number of Constellation Scrip that BRL Hardy shareholders can elect to receive under the merger proposal are set out in this Scheme Booklet.
 
The merger consideration represents a premium of 37% to BRL Hardy's closing share price on the day prior to announcement that the parties were in merger discussions and a 52% premium to the volume weighted average price of BRL Hardy shares for the two months up to that date.
 
Under the proposal, BRL Hardy option holders will receive cash consideration for the cancellation of their BRL Hardy options.
 
After considering the proposal in detail, the Directors of BRL Hardy have formed the view that the proposal is in the best interests of shareholders and in the best interests of option holders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors of BRL Hardy unanimously recommend that, in the absence of a higher offer, BRL Hardy shareholders and option holders vote in favour of the proposal.
 
The reasons behind the Directors' recommendation are set out in the Scheme Booklet. The Board has appointed an independent expert, Deloitte Corporate Finance, to review the proposal. The independent expert concluded that, in the absence of a higher offer, the merger proposal is in the best interests of shareholders and in the best interests of option holders as a whole.
 
The merger will be implemented via Schemes of Arrangement and requires the approval of BRL Hardy shareholders and option holders and the Supreme Court of South Australia. The Schemes of Arrangement will be considered at meetings of BRL Hardy shareholders and BRL Hardy option holders to be held at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street Adelaide, South Australia, on 20 March 2003.
 
Each director of BRL Hardy intends to vote all BRL Hardy shares and BRL Hardy options controlled by that director in favour of the relevant resolutions.
 
This Scheme Booklet which follows sets out the full details of the merger proposal. I encourage you to read it carefully and to vote on the important resolutions to be considered at the Meetings.
 
If you have any queries about the merger proposal, please call the BRL Hardy toll free information line on 1300 666 724.

Dear Shareholder and Option Holder
 
Proposed Merger of BRL Hardy and Constellation
 
On 17 January 2003, the respective boards of directors of BRL Hardy and Constellation announced their intention to merge through Schemes of Arrangement.
 
If approved, the merger will create the world's largest wine company by sales. The merger will provide the ability to capture growth for both companies at a faster rate in growing New World wine markets. The merger will enhance Constellation's position as a leading global diversified beverage alcohol company.
 
Constellation is offering for BRL shares either cash of $10.50 per BRL share, or a number of Constellation shares, determined based on the volume weighted average Constellation share price and the US$/A$ exchange rate during a price setting period before the merger becomes effective. The Constellation shares will also be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in the form of CHESS Depositary interests () for those shareholders wishing to trade their holdings on the Australian market. Full details of the offer are set out in this Scheme Booklet.
"CDIs"
 
By accepting Constellation shares as consideration in this merger, you can also participate in the benefits of combining two highly successful growth companies, and the exciting future of the world's leading wine company. Following the merger:
 
Constellation will benefit from the bringing together of two complementary businesses that share a common growth orientation and operating philosophies.
 - 
            
 
Constellation will enhance its revenue growth potential in the UK, Europe and other strategic international markets.
 - 
            
 
Constellation will gain significant scale, with more than US$3.2 billion in group sales, of which wine sales will represent US$1.7 billion.
 - 
            
 
In wine, Constellation will emerge with the number 1 position by volume in the United Kingdom, with 8 of the top 20 off-premise brands. Constellation will also hold the number 1 position by volume in Australia, and will strengthen its number 2 position by volume in the United States.
 - 
            
 
Constellation will continue to benefit from a broad portfolio across categories, with strong businesses in imported beer and spirits in the United States and as the number one independent drinks wholesaler in the UK.
 - 
            
 
Constellation's aggregated portfolio will have an even broader range of products and a greater geographic reach.
 - 
            
 
We are extremely excited about the opportunity to merge our two companies and to build on the successful partnership which started with the establishment of the Pacific Wine Partners joint venture in 2001.
 
For BRL shareholders electing to accept consideration in full, or part, through Constellation shares, we look forward to welcoming you as a shareholder in Constellation.

at a glance
 
This summary provides an overview of the Merger proposal. You should read this Scheme Booklet in full before making any voting decisions.
 
 
 
Background
 
On 17 January 2003, BRL Hardy announced a proposal to merge with Constellation, BRL Hardy's U.S. joint venture partner, by way of schemes of arrangement. The merged group will be the world's largest wine company by sales, and will enjoy strong positions in the United States, Europe and Australia.
 
Merger Consideration
 
Under the Merger proposal, BRL Shareholders can elect to receive in exchange for their BRL Shares, either:
 
Cash Consideration, being $10.50 per BRL Share;
 - 
   
 
Scrip Consideration, being a number of Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs per BRL Share determined as set out in Section 1.2 of this Scheme Booklet; or
 - 
   
 
a combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration.
 - 
   
 
Option Holders will receive cash as set out in Section 8.3 of this Scheme Booklet, in exchange for the cancellation of their Options.
 
If the total number of Constellation Shares which Constellation would otherwise be required to issue to satisfy Elections from BRL Hardy Shareholders for Scrip Consideration exceeds 15,000,000 shares, then the number of Constellation Shares each such BRL Shareholder is entitled to receive will be scaled back on a pro rata basis and such BRL Shareholders will receive Cash Consideration with respect to such BRL Shares subjected to such scale-back. For further details refer to Section 1.2.
 
Implementation and Timetable
 
The Share Scheme is to be implemented by a scheme of arrangement, which will be voted on by BRL Shareholders at a meeting to be held at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003, commencing at 10.00 am.
 
The Option Scheme is to be implemented by a scheme of arrangement, which will be voted on by Option Holders at a meeting to be held at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003 commencing at 11.00 am or at such later time as the General Meeting concludes or is adjourned.
 
Each Scheme also requires Court approval, which is expected to be sought on 27 March 2003 if the Schemes are approved by BRL Shareholders and Option Holders.
 
Trading on the ASX
 
If the Merger proposal is implemented, Constellation will cause Constellation CDIs representing Constellation Shares to be listed for trading on the ASX. Constellation CDIs are expected to commence trading on the ASX on a deferred settlement basis on 7 April 2003.
The Merger - Your Questions Answered
 
This section provides summary answers to some basic questions that BRL Shareholders may have. It should be read in conjunction with the whole Scheme Booklet. Option Holders should refer to Sections 8 and 9 for a summary of the Option Scheme which should also be read in conjunction with the entire Scheme Booklet.
 
Q & A
 
Questions about the Merger consideration
 
Q1
What will I receive if the Merger is approved?
 
A
You are being offered the following choice of consideration in exchange for your BRL Shares:
Cash Consideration, being $10.50 per BRL Share;
 - 
   
 
Scrip Consideration, being a number of Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs per BRL Share determined as set out in Section 1.2 of this Scheme Booklet; or
 - 
   
 
a combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration.
 - 
   
 
 
Q2
When do I have to make an Election?
 
A
You will need to make an Election on your Election Form which must be returned to the BRL Share Registry before 5.00pm (Adelaide time) on 4 April 2003.
 
 
Q3
What form of consideration will I receive if I do not make an Election?
 
A
If you do not make an Election you will be paid Cash Consideration for your BRL Shares.
 
 
Q4
If I elect to receive Scrip Consideration, does this mean that I will receive Constellation Shares?
 
A
If you make an Election to receive Scrip Consideration and your address on the Register is in Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore or the United Kingdom you will receive Constellation CDIs traded in Australia on the ASX.
 
If you make an Election to receive Scrip Consideration and your address on the Register is in the United States, you will receive Constellation Shares traded on the NYSE.
 
If you make an Election to receive Scrip Consideration and your address on the Register is in any other country, you will not be entitled to receive any Scrip Consideration and you will instead receive in cash the proceeds of sale of the Constellation Shares which you elected to receive (less any applicable brokerage, taxes and any other costs of sale).
Q5
What is a Constellation CDI?
 
A
Constellation CDIs are CHESS Depositary Interests () in Constellation Shares. CDIs are beneficial interests in securities traded on the ASX under the electronic transfer and settlement system operated by the ASX. CDIs are issued to enable the electronic transfer and settlement on the ASX of shares issued by foreign companies such as Constellation. CDI holders receive all the economic benefits of actual ownership of the underlying shares.
"CDIs"
 
 
Q6
How many Constellation Shares does one Constellation CDI represent?
 
A
It is currently expected that the ratio of Constellation CDIs to underlying Constellation Shares will be 10 to 1. For example, if you elect to receive Scrip Consideration and you are otherwise entitled to receive 100 Constellation Shares for your BRL Shares you will receive 1,000 Constellation CDIs. This ratio will, however, be subject to the ASX's approval upon the listing of Constellation CDIs.
 
 
Q7
If I receive Constellation CDIs, can I trade them other than on the ASX?
 
A
If you wish, you can trade the underlying Constellation Shares which your Constellation CDIs represent on the NYSE. To do this, you must first convert the Constellation CDIs into shares simply by notifying Constellation's Australian share registry who will arrange for the Constellation CDIs to be converted into the underlying Constellation Shares.
 
 
Q8
Is there a limit on the amount of Scrip Consideration I can receive?
 
A
The maximum number of shares Constellation will issue to BRL Shareholders who elect to receive Scrip Consideration under the Share Scheme is 15,000,000 Constellation Shares (referred to in this Scheme Booklet as the ).
"Scrip Consideration Cap"
 
Accordingly, if you elect to receive Scrip Consideration for all or a specified number of your BRL Shares and the total number of Constellation Shares which would be required to be issued to satisfy this and all other Elections for Scrip Consideration exceeds the Scrip Consideration Cap, the number of Constellation Shares you are entitled to receive will be scaled back on a pro rata basis and you will receive Cash Consideration with respect to such scaled back BRL Shares.
 
This is illustrated by the example below:
 
Suppose you elect to receive Scrip Consideration for your total holding of 1,000 BRL Shares and the total number of Constellation Shares which would be required to be issued to satisfy all Elections for Scrip Consideration in full was 18,750,000, the scale back provisions would apply.
 
The number of BRL Shares for which you would receive Scrip Consideration would be calculated as 15,000,000  18,750,000 x 1,000 = 800 BRL Shares. You would receive Cash Consideration for the remaining 200 BRL Shares.
 
For further details see Section 1.2.
 
 
Q9
What happens if the Constellation CDIs cannot be traded on the ASX?
 
A
In the event that the Constellation CDIs are not listed by ASX, then all consideration payable under the Share Scheme will be paid in the form of Cash Consideration. Constellation has no reason to believe that the Constellation CDIs will not be listed by ASX.
Q10
If I elect to receive Scrip Consideration, can I expect to receive cash dividends declared from Constellation?
 
A
While you will be entitled to receive any dividends declared by Constellation in the future, you should note that:
 
Constellation has not paid a cash dividend since its initial public offering in 1973;
 - 
   
 
Constellation currently has a policy of not paying cash dividends but instead retaining all of its earnings to finance the development and expansion of its business;
 - 
   
 
Constellation does not currently intend to change its dividend policy; and
 - 
   
 
Constellation's existing and new senior credit facilities and bridging facility and its indentures for its senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit the payment of cash dividends (see Section 3.6(c) for more details).
 - 
   
 
If Constellation does pay dividends in the future, they will not be franked for Australian tax purposes.
 
 
Q11
How will fractional shares be treated?
 
A
If, pursuant to the Merger, you become entitled to a fraction of a Constellation Share, the number of Constellation Shares to which you are entitled will be rounded down to the next lowest whole number, and you will receive cash in lieu of all fractional shares to which you are entitled. For further details see clause 5.7 of the Share Scheme at Section 13.
 
 
Q12
Will I have to pay brokerage fees or stamp duty?
 
A
You will not have to pay brokerage or stamp duty in connection with the Merger.
 
Q13
When will I receive my consideration?
 
A
Cheques in respect of any Cash Consideration due to you will be despatched to you within 5 Business Days after the Implementation Date.
 
Holding statements in respect of any Constellation CDIs due to you will be despatched within the same period although you will be entitled to trade the Constellation CDIs to which you are entitled before that time on a deferred settlement basis (see Section 7 for details about Constellation CDIs).
 
 
Q14
If the Merger is implemented will this be a taxable transaction for Australian tax purposes?
 
A
The exchange of your BRL Shares pursuant to this Merger may be a taxable transaction to you. However, Australian resident BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration pursuant to the Merger should be entitled to receive CGT rollover relief with respect to that Scrip Consideration.
 
BRL Shareholders who elect to receive cash or who receive cash due to a pro rata scale back (refer section 1.2(c)) may be eligible to apply a discount to any capital gain which arises on the transfer of BRL Shares pursuant to this Merger.
 
Further details of the tax implications of the transaction are set out in Section 10 of this Scheme Booklet. BRL Shareholders should seek their own independent professional advice in relation to the precise tax consequences in respect of their own particular circumstances.
Questions about voting
 
Q15

BRL Shareholders who together hold at least 75% of the total number of BRL Shares voted at the Share Scheme Meeting.
 - 
   
 
Q19
Should I vote?
 
A
You do not have to vote. However, the BRL Board believes that the Share Scheme is important to all BRL Shareholders and urges you to read this Scheme Booklet carefully and vote in favour of the Share Scheme.
 
 
Q20
What happens if I do not vote, or if I vote against the Share Scheme proposal?
 
A
If you are a BRL Shareholder as at 10.00 pm on the Record Date and the Share Scheme proposal is implemented your BRL Shares will be transferred pursuant to the Share Scheme and you will be entitled to receive the Share Scheme Consideration notwithstanding that you did not vote or voted against the Share Scheme.

Q21

Other questions
 
 
Q22
What if the Share Scheme is not implemented on or before 30 April 2003?
 
A
If the Share Scheme is not implemented on or before 30 April 2003, either Constellation or BRL Hardy may terminate the Implementation Deed. If this occurs the Merger will not proceed.
 
 
Q23
What is the purpose of the General Meeting?
 
A
The General Meeting for BRL Shareholders is to consider and, if thought fit, to approve the financial assistance BRL Hardy is proposing to provide to Constellation in connection with the Share Scheme. The Directors believe that by agreeing to pay for the cancellation of the Options and the Non-Executive Options, and by agreeing to borrow funds from Constellation to do so and incurring an obligation to repay and to pay interest on the funds so borrowed, BRL Hardy is financially assisting Constellation to acquire BRL Shares under the Share Scheme. Such assistance will be in breach of the Corporations Act unless sanctioned by a special resolution of BRL Shareholders passed at a general meeting. For further details see Section 2.13.
 
 
Q24
If the Share Scheme is implemented will I receive a final dividend in respect of BRL Hardy's financial period ended 31 December 2002?
 
A
It is a condition of the Implementation Deed that BRL Hardy does not declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution of its profits, or assets. Therefore, if the Share Scheme is implemented, BRL Shareholders will not receive a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 31 December 2002.
 
 
Q25
Have any major shareholders indicated their intentions?
 
A
The Responsible Entity of IWIF, the largest shareholder of BRLHardy, has resolved, subject to unit holder approval and to no higher offer being received, to vote in favour of the Share Scheme. Their decision is also subject to final details of the Merger being released.

The Schemes have not been proposed by BRL Hardy or Constellation for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Corporations Act. Among the reasons for which the Schemes have been proposed are to facilitate:
 
the offering of Constellation Shares subject to the Scrip Consideration Cap and the mechanism for the allocation of the Constellation Shares if the Scrip Consideration Cap is exceeded;
(i)
                 
 
the ability of Constellation to rely on an exemption under Section 3(a)(10) under the U.S. Securities Act from the requirement to register Constellation Shares to be issued under the Share Scheme under the U.S. Securities Act. This exemption would not be available if the transaction were structured other than as a court approved scheme of arrangement; and

the cancellation of the Options in accordance with the Option Scheme.
(iii)
           
 
If the Supreme Court of South Australia approves the Share Scheme, its approval will constitute the basis for the Constellation Shares to be issued without the need for registration under the U.S. Securities Act, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act. The Court does not take any responsibility for the contents of the Explanatory Statement included in this Scheme Booklet.
 
A copy of this Scheme Booklet has been lodged with the ASX. Neither the ASX nor any of its officers takes any responsibility for the contents of this Scheme Booklet.

The Constellation Shares to be issued pursuant to the Share Scheme have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Constellation Shares issued pursuant to the Share Scheme will be issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided in Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act based on the approval of the Share Scheme by the Court.
 
If the Court approves the Share Scheme, its approval will constitute the basis for the Constellation Shares to be issued without registration under the U.S. Securities Act, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act.
 
The transaction is subject to the disclosure requirements of Australia. This document has been prepared in accordance with Australian requirements and style, which differ from the requirements and style in the United States for disclosure documents prepared for business combination transactions. Financial information included in this document has been prepared in accordance with Australian accounting standards (unless otherwise indicated) and may not be comparable to the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. accounting standards.
 
For BRL Shareholders who are subject to United States taxation, the exchange of BRL Shares will be fully taxable for United States tax purposes regardless of whether such holder receives the Scrip Consideration or the Cash Consideration. Each such holder is strongly urged to review the description of the tax consequences to the BRL Shareholders who are subject to United States taxation which is set forth in Section 10.2 of this Scheme Booklet and to consult their United States tax advisor as to the United States tax consequences of the transaction.
 
Resale of Constellation Shares under U.S. Federal Securities Laws
 
If at the time the Share Scheme is submitted to a vote of BRL Shareholders, you are an "affiliate" of BRL Hardy or Constellation, then under Rule 145 of the U.S. Securities Act you may not offer or sell or otherwise dispose of the Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs issued to you under the Share Scheme in the United States or to U.S. Persons unless that offer or sale or other disposition has been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or is made in conformity with Rule 145 under the U.S. Securities Act or pursuant to any other applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.  For these purposes, an "affiliate" includes the directors, executive officers and controlling stockholders of BRL Hardy or Constellation.

Section 
1
1              Key Features Of Scheme and Considerations for BRL Shareholders
 
This Section should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this Scheme Booklet.
 
1.1         
Overview
 
On 17 January 2003, BRL Hardy and Constellation announced a proposal to merge. Under the proposal:
Constellation Australia, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation, will acquire all of the BRL Shares by way of scheme of arrangement; and
 - 
                      
 
all of the Options will be cancelled by way of scheme of arrangement.
 - 
                      
 
The Share Scheme is subject to a number of conditions including:
 
approval of the Share Scheme by BRL Shareholders; and
 - 
                      
 
approval of the Share Scheme by the Court.
 - 
                      
 
The other conditions to the Share Scheme are discussed in Section 1.9 and are set out in full in the copy of the Implementation Deed which is set out in Section 12.
 
If the Share Scheme is implemented, BRL Hardy will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation and will be de-listed from the ASX.
 
The Option Scheme is subject to a number of conditions including:
 
approval of the Share Scheme, by the Court;
 - 
                      
 
approval of the Resolution, by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders; and
 - 
                      
 
approval of the Option Scheme, by the Court.
 - 
                      
 
1.2         
What you will receive
 
(a)     Overview
 
Under the Share Scheme, you are able to choose to receive the following consideration alternatives for your BRL Shares:
 
Cash Consideration of $10.50 per BRL Share;
 - 
                      
 
Scrip Consideration, being a number of Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs per BRL Share; or
 - 
                      
 
a combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration.
 - 
                      
 
To make your choice you should tick the appropriate box on the Election Form. If you elect to receive a combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration, you will need to specify the number of your BRL Shares in respect of which you wish to receive Scrip Consideration. You should also note the restrictions set out in paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) below.
 
(b)     Scrip Exchange Ratio
 
If you elect to receive Scrip Consideration in respect of all or a specified number of your BRL Shares, the number of Constellation Shares that you will be entitled to receive (subject to paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f)) for each of those BRL Shares () will depend upon two variables, being the Constellation VWAP and the Exchange Rate.
"Scrip Exchange Ratio"
 
The Constellation VWAP is an average share price of Constellation Shares traded on the NYSE over the ten day trading period ending prior to the Second Court Date. The Exchange Rate is an average US$/A$ exchange rate quoted by Bloomberg for the New York market over the same period. The actual Constellation VWAP and Exchange Rate will be announced by BRL Hardy to the ASX and posted on BRL Hardy's website at the conclusion of the ten day trading period.
 
The Scrip Exchange Ratio will be determined as follows:
 
 
Set out below is a "Ready Reckoner" which illustrates the application of the above method of calculating the Scrip Exchange Ratio.
 
The Ready Reckoner shows the fraction of a Constellation Share which would be issued based on each Constellation VWAP listed in the first column at each of the Exchange Rates listed in the top row.
 
Scrip Consideration - Ready Reckoner
(The Scrip Exchange Ratio or fraction of a Constellation Share you will be entitled to receive for each BRL Share held, is shown in gold)
 
 
 
 
The following are some examples shown in the Ready Reckoner:
 
if the Constellation VWAP is US$22.50 or lower and the Exchange Rate is $0.58, then the Scrip Exchange Ratio will be 0.2707
 - 
                      
Constellation Shares for every one BRL Hardy share held;
 
if the Constellation VWAP is exactly US$25.00 and the Exchange Rate is $0.60, then the Scrip Exchange Ratio will be 0.2520 Constellation Shares for every one BRL Hardy share held;
 - 
                      
 
if the Constellation VWAP is US$27.50 or higher and the Exchange Rate is $0.62, then the Scrip Exchange Ratio will be 0.2367 Constellation Shares for every one BRL Hardy share held.
 - 
                      
 
Your entitlement to Constellation Shares as determined above will be issued to you in the form of Constellation CDIs if your address on the Register is in Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore or the United Kingdom as at 10.00 pm on the Record Date. If so, you will be issued Constellation CDIs at the ratio of 10 Constellation CDIs for every one Constellation Share to which you are entitled (subject to confirmation by the ASX). Further details of Constellation CDIs are set out in Section 7.2.
 
If your address on the Register is in the United States as at 10.00pm on the Record Date, you will receive Constellation Shares.
 
(c)     Scale back
 
The maximum number of shares Constellation will issue to BRL Shareholders who elect to receive Scrip Consideration under the Share Scheme is 15,000,000 Constellation Shares (referred to in this Scheme Booklet as the "").
Scrip Consideration Cap
 
If the total number of Constellation Shares () which Constellation would otherwise be required to issue to satisfy Elections from BRL Shareholders for Scrip Consideration exceeds the Scrip Consideration Cap, then the number of BRL Hardy Shares with respect to which Elections to receive Scrip Consideration will be satisfied will be scaled back on a pro rata basis. The pro rata scale-back applicable to each BRL Shareholder will be determined by multiplying the number of BRL Shares in respect of which such BRL Shareholder made an Election to receive Scrip Consideration by the ratio of the Scrip Consideration Cap to the Total Scrip Election.
"Total Scrip Election"
 
This is illustrated by the example below:
 
Suppose you elect to receive Scrip Consideration for your total holding of 1,000 BRL Shares and the Total Scrip Election was 18.75 million, the scale back provisions would apply.
 
The number of BRL Shares for which you would receive Scrip Consideration would be calculated as 15,000,000  18,750,000 x 1,000 = 800 BRL Shares. You would receive Cash Consideration for the remaining 200 BRL Shares.
 
(d)     Fractional Entitlements
 
Entitlements to less than whole numbers of Constellation Shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and fractional entitlements will be paid in the form of cash (for further details see clause 5.7 of the Share Scheme in Section 13).
 
(e)     Foreign Scheme Shareholders
 
BRL Shareholders whose address in the Register as at 10.00 pm on the Record Date is a place outside Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States will be treated as Foreign Scheme Shareholders for the purpose of the Share Scheme.
 
If a Foreign Scheme Shareholder makes an Election to receive Scrip Consideration for all or a specified number of their BRL Shares then the Constellation Shares which would otherwise be required to be issued to the Foreign Scheme Shareholder will be issued to a nominee appointed by Constellation.  Constellation will cause the nominee to offer these Constellation Shares on the NYSE at such price and on such terms as the nominee shall determine and to remit to Constellation the proceeds of sale.  Constellation will then account to the Foreign Scheme Shareholders for the proceeds received after deduction of any applicable brokerage, taxes and other costs of sale.  Foreign Scheme Shareholders will receive the proceeds in U.S. dollars.  For further details see clause 5.6 of the Share Scheme in Section 13.
 
(f)
                
Failure to satisfy Australian Listing Conditions
 
If the Australian Listing Condition is not satisfied by 8.00 am on the Second Court Date then, in accordance with the terms of the Share Scheme, all Scheme Shareholders will receive Cash Consideration whether or not they have elected to receive Scrip Consideration.  Constellation has no reason to believe that the Constellation CDIs will not be listed by ASX.
 
(g)
             
Failure to elect
 
If an Election is not made by a BRL Shareholder prior to 5.00 pm on the Record Date, then that BRL Shareholder will be deemed to have elected to receive Cash Consideration in respect of all its BRL Shares.
 
(h)
             
Settlement date
 
Settlement of the Share Scheme Consideration, whether in Cash Consideration or Scrip Consideration, will be made within 5 Business Days after the Implementation Date.
 
Cash Consideration will be paid by cheque drawn in Australian dollars.
 
The full terms relating to the payment of the Share Scheme Consideration are contained in the Share Scheme set out in Section 13 and the Deed Poll set out in Section 14. Further information concerning Constellation CDIs and the rights attaching to the underlying Constellation Shares is set out in Section 7.
1.3
                              
Directors' Recommendation
 
Your Directors believe that the proposed Merger is in the best interests of BRL Shareholders and your Directors unanimously recommend that, in the absence of a higher offer, you vote in favour of the Share Scheme. The reasons for your Directors' recommendation are outlined below.
 
All Directors who hold BRL Shares intend to vote in favour of the Share Scheme.
 
Details of the interests of Directors are provided in Section 11.4.
 
1.4
                              
Reasons to vote in favour of the Share Scheme
 
(a)
              
Substantial premium to recent BRL Hardy share price
 
The $10.50 value of the Share Scheme Consideration represents a substantial premium to the price at which BRL Shares traded prior to the announcement that the parties were in discussions with respect to the Merger:
 - 
                      
 
A 37% premium to the closing share price of BRL Shares on 13 January 2003, the last day immediately prior to the announcement that the parties were in discussions with respect to the Merger; and
 - 
                     
 
A 52% premium to the volume weighted average share price of BRL Shares over the two months immediately prior to 13 January 2003.
 - 
                     
 
 
(b)
              
Independent Expert Opinion
 
Deloitte Corporate Finance Pty Limited was appointed by BRL Hardy to prepare an Independent Expert's Report in relation to the Schemes. It has concluded that, in the absence of a higher offer, the Share Scheme is in the best interests of BRL Shareholders as a whole. In reaching this conclusion, the Independent Expert has also made the following statements:
 
(page 88 of the Independent Expert's Report).
"the Cash Consideration represents a significant premium over and above the recent share market price of BRL Shares"
 
(page 88 of the Independent Expert's Report).
"the Cash Consideration is within our estimated fair market value range of a BRL Share on a control basis"
 
The Independent Expert has estimated the fair market value of a BRL Share to be in the range of $9.76 to $10.77 inclusive of a premium for control.
 
The Independent Expert's Report is set out in full in Section 19.
 
(c)
              
If the Merger is not approved, there is a risk that BRL Hardy's share price will fall
 
BRL Hardy's share price rose following the announcement of discussions with respect to the proposed Merger with Constellation. On 13 January 2003, the day prior to this announcement, the closing price of BRL Shares was $7.67. As at 7 February 2003 the BRL Hardy share price closed at $10.33.
 - 
                      
 
Your Directors believe there is a risk that the BRL Hardy share price will fall if the Merger is not approved.
 - 
                      
1.5
                              
Assessing the Choice of Consideration
 
Whilst your Directors unanimously recommend that, in the absence of a higher offer, you vote in favour of the Share Scheme, they make no recommendation as to the form of Share Scheme Consideration that you should elect to receive. In making your Election, you should take into account the factors outlined below and your own personal tax position and other circumstances. If in doubt you should consult your legal, financial or other professional adviser.
 
(a)
             
Factors relating to Cash Consideration
 
Benefits
(i)
                 
 
Receiving Cash Consideration will provide BRL Shareholders with the benefit of certainty of the value of the consideration received. In other words, BRL Shareholders who elect to receive Cash Consideration will receive $10.50 per BRL Share held as at the Record Date.
 
Other Considerations
(ii)
              
 
Receiving Cash Consideration could trigger an immediate CGT liability for some BRL Shareholders which could otherwise be deferred. Further details of the tax implications of the Share Scheme are set out in Section 10.
 
(b)
             
Factors relating to Scrip Consideration
 
Benefits
(i)
                 
 
Receiving Scrip Consideration will provide you with the following benefits:
 
Exposure to Constellation - BRL Shareholders will gain exposure to the assets, operations and growth prospects of Constellation, the largest single-source supplier of wine, spirits and imported beer in the United States.
 - 
                     
 
Continuing participation in the future of the Merged Group - BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration will not only retain exposure to the assets, operations and growth prospects of BRL Hardy, but will also be able to participate in:
 - 
                     
 
the creation of the world's largest wine company by sales; and
 - 
                      
 
the synergies between Constellation and BRL Hardy which are expected to be realised as a result of the Merger.
 - 
                      
 
Details of the profile of Constellation and the expected profile of the Merged Group are set out in Sections 3 and 5, respectively.
 
CGT rollover relief - the Share Scheme is expected to satisfy the general requirements of the CGT scrip for scrip rollover provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act. As a result, CGT rollover relief should be available to Australian resident BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration (but not in respect of any proportion of their holding for which they receive Cash Consideration, including as a result of their Election or the pro rata scale back referred to in Section 1.2(c) or if the Australian Listing Conditions is not satisfied). Further details of the tax implications of the Merger are set out in Section 10.
 - 
                     
 
ASX listing - BRL Shareholders who receive Constellation CDIs will be able to trade their Constellation CDIs on the ASX.
 - 
                     
 
Risks
(ii)
              
 
You should be aware of the following risks if you are considering electing to receive Scrip Consideration:
 
The increased level of gearing that BRL Shareholders will be exposed to should they receive Scrip Consideration (for further information see Sections 5 and 6).
 - 
                     
 
For BRL Shareholders who receive Constellation CDIs, Constellation CDIs are likely to have lower liquidity on the ASX as compared with the existing liquidity of BRL Shares on the ASX and Constellation Shares on the NYSE. However, Constellation CDIs can be converted into Constellation Shares and traded on the NYSE (for further information see Section 7.2(d)).
 - 
                     
Other considerations
(iii)
           
 
You should also consider the following if you are considering electing to receive Scrip Consideration:
 
Value of your consideration will fluctuate - -Unlike the Cash Consideration, the value of the Scrip Consideration that BRL Shareholders will receive will fluctuate with movements in the price of Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs. It follows that the value of the Scrip Consideration issued to BRL Shareholders could when issued, be lower or higher than the value it would have had as at the date of this Scheme Booklet.
 - 
                     
 
Dividend policy - BRL Hardy has historically paid fully franked dividends to its shareholders on a regular basis. In contrast, Constellation has a policy of not paying dividends to Constellation Shareholders but reinvesting earnings in the growth of the business and Constellation's existing and new senior credit facilities and bridging facility and its indentures for its senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit the payment of cash dividends (see Section 3.6(c) for more details). As a result, BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration are likely to experience a cessation in payment of dividends. If Constellation does pay dividends in the future, they will not be franked for Australian tax purposes and are likely to be subject to US withholding tax.
 - 
                     
 
Different business profile - BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration will be exposed to a different mix of businesses than they are currently exposed to through their shareholdings in BRL Hardy. In particular, whereas BRL Hardy is a pure wine business, Constellation's business encompasses production and marketing of wine, spirits and beer. This means that the risk and return characteristics of their investment will be different from that which is currently the case.
 - 
                     
 
Rights attaching to Constellation Shares -BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration will receive an entitlement to Constellation Shares. Constellation also has Constellation B Shares on issue which carry different rights from Constellation Shares (in particular, Constellation B Shares carry enhanced voting rights and enhanced rights to elect directors). A summary of Constellation's share capital and the differences between Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares is set out in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.
 - 
                     
 
Controlling shareholder group - Unlike BRL Hardy, Constellation has a controlling shareholder group (the Sands family). For further details, refer to Section 7.6.
 - 
                     
 
Diluted percentage holding - BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration in exchange for BRL Shares will receive a smaller percentage holding in Constellation than the percentage holding in BRL Hardy represented by the BRL Shares they exchange.
 -

Closing price on 7 February 2003 (latest recorded sale price before the Scheme Booklet was lodged for registration with ASIC);
 - 
                     
 
Highest and lowest recorded sale prices during the period 7 November 2002 to 7 February 2003;
 - 
                     
 
Closing price on 16 January 2003 (latest recorded sale price prior to announcement of the Merger); and
 - 
                     
 
Closing price on 10 January 2003 (latest recorded sale price prior to announcement that the parties were in discussions with respect to the Merger).

No assurance can be given that changes in Constellation's share price historically is indicative of future changes in Constellation's share price. Exchange rate movements may affect the value and/or the price of, and income (if any) from, Constellation Scrip.
 
Further information on historical share prices for Constellation Shares is set out in section 3.6.
 
1.6
                              
Relevant Considerations Against the Share Scheme
 
(a)
             
BRL Shareholders will no longer control BRL Hardy
 
BRL Shareholders will no longer be able to hold a direct interest in BRL Hardy and will no longer collectively control BRL Hardy.
 
(b)
             
Forms of Share Scheme Consideration may not be attractive
 
The forms of Share Scheme Consideration may not be attractive to you as a result of the risks and other considerations set out in Section 1.5(a)(ii) and Section 1.5(b)(ii) and (iii).
 
(c)
             
Loss of Dividends / Franking Credits
 
BRL Hardy has historically paid fully franked dividends on a regular basis. BRL Shareholders will no longer be entitled to receive these dividends after implementation of the Merger. Further, it is a condition of the Implementation Deed that BRL Hardy does not declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution of its profits or assets.
 
Therefore, if the Share Scheme is implemented, BRL Shareholders will not receive a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 31 December 2002.
 
As Constellation has a policy of not paying dividends and Constellation's existing and new senior credit facilities and Bridging Facility and its indentures for its senior notes and senior subordinated notes limit the payment of cash dividends (see Section 3.6(c) for more details), BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration are likely to experience a cessation in payment of dividends.
 
(d)
             
CGT consequences
 
The Share Scheme is expected to satisfy the general requirements of the CGT scrip for scrip rollover provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. As a result, CGT rollover relief should be available to Australian resident BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration (but not in respect of any proportion of their holding for which they receive Cash Consideration, including as a result of their Election or the pro rata scale back referred to in Section 1.2(c)) or if the Australian Listing Condition is not satisfied. Further details of the tax implications of the Merger are set out in Section 10.
 
If the Share Scheme does not proceed, there are no CGT consequences for BRL Shareholders while they continue to hold their BRL Shares, until they choose to dispose of those BRL Shares at which time a CGT taxable event may occur.
 
If the Share Scheme does proceed and CGT is payable, BRL Shareholders resident in Australia may be eligible to elect to apply a discount to any capital gain which arises on the transfer of their BRL Shares pursuant to the Share Scheme. Further information is contained in Section 10 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
Holders of BRL Shares should seek their own independent professional advice in relation to the precise tax consequences in respect of their own particular circumstances.
1.7
                              
Other Relevant Considerations
 
(a)
             
Implications of Voting "No"
 
If you vote "No", that does not mean that the Share Scheme will not be implemented. If the Share Scheme is approved by the necessary majority of BRL Shareholders and by the Court, you will be treated in the same manner as all other BRL Shareholders as at the Record Date and, accordingly, your BRL Shares will be transferred to Constellation Australia and, unless you have made an Election to receive Scrip Consideration, you will receive the Cash Consideration even though you may have voted against the Share Scheme.
 
(b)
             
No Solicitation and transaction compensation arrangements
 
Certain arrangements have been entered into between Constellation and BRL Hardy in relation to no solicitation and transaction compensation. Summaries of the relevant agreements are set out in Section 11.12.
 
(c)
             
IWIF's Intentions
 
The Responsible Entity of IWIF, the largest shareholder of BRLHardy, announced to the ASX on 6 February 2003, that it has resolved, subject to unitholder approval, to vote in favour of the Share Scheme. Their decision is also subject to no higher offer being received and final details of the Merger being released.
 
1.8
                              
Implications of Failure to Approve the Merger
 
(a)
             
No Payment of Consideration
 
Your Directors have recommended that BRL Shareholders approve the Share Scheme for the reasons set out earlier in this Section, in particular the value considerations outlined in Section 1.4(a).
 
Further, as mentioned in Section 1.4(c) above, your Directors believe there is a risk that the BRL Hardy share price will fall if the Share Scheme is not approved.
 
(b)
             
Continued ASX Listing and Intention for Ongoing Operations
 
If the Share Scheme does not proceed, BRL Hardy will remain listed on the ASX and it would be the BRL Board's intention to continue operating in line with its previously stated objectives. In these circumstances, BRL Shareholders who retain their shares will continue to share in any benefits and risks in relation to BRL Hardy's ongoing business.
 
1.9
                              
Conditions
 
The obligations of BRL Hardy and Constellation under the Implementation Deed, which relate to implementation of the Schemes, are conditional upon the Conditions contained in clause 4 of the Implementation Deed being satisfied or waived. A copy of the Implementation Deed appears in Section 12 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
As at the date of this Scheme Booklet:
 
all of the US Listing Conditions have been satisfied; and
(a)
             
 
none of the other Conditions has been satisfied or waived.
(b)
            
Share Scheme Implementation and Financial Assistance
 
 
 
Section
2
Share Scheme Implementation and Financial Assistance
2.            
 
2.1
                              
Overall effect of the Share Scheme
 
The Share Scheme, if implemented, will result in Constellation acquiring, by a transfer of shares, all Scheme Shares held by BRL Shareholders as at the Record Date.
 
The effect of the Share Scheme will be that BRL Hardy will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation and will be delisted from the ASX.
 
The explanation below does not deal with taxation effects or consequences of the Share Scheme, further details of which are set out in Section 10 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
2.2
                              
Classes of members affected by the Share Scheme
 
BRL Hardy only has one class of shares on issue -ordinary shares. There is only one class of ordinary shareholders who will be affected by the Share Scheme, namely BRL Shareholders.
 
The effect of the Share Scheme on BRL Shareholders is that each BRL Shareholder will cease to be a holder of, or have any interest in, BRL Shares in return for receiving the Share Scheme Consideration.
 
2.3
                              
Steps in implementing the Share Scheme
 
On 17 January 2003, Constellation and BRL Hardy entered into the Implementation Deed in relation to the Share Scheme (and the Option Scheme) under which BRL Hardy agreed to propose the Share Scheme. A copy of the Implementation Deed is included in Section 12 and a copy of the Share Scheme is included in Section 13.
(a)
             
 
On 6 February 2003, Constellation executed the Deed Poll pursuant to which Constellation agreed, subject to the Share Scheme becoming Effective, to procure that Constellation Australia provide to each Scheme Shareholder the Share Scheme Consideration to which such Scheme Shareholder is entitled under the terms of the Share Scheme. A copy of the Deed Poll is included in Section 14.
(b)
            
 
On 10 February 2003 the Court ordered that BRL Hardy convene a scheme meeting of BRL Shareholders at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003 commencing at 10.00 am (Adelaide time), for the purposes of approving the Share Scheme.
(c)
             
 
BRL Hardy will apply to the Court for an order approving the Share Scheme if:
(d)
            
 
the Share Scheme is approved by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders voting at the Share Scheme Meeting; and
 - 
                        
 
all other conditions to the Share Scheme refered to in clause 2.1 of the Share Scheme have been satisfied or waived.
 - 
                        
 
If the Court order referred to in paragraph (d) above is obtained, then BRL Hardy will lodge with ASIC an office copy of the Court order under section 411 of the Corporations Act approving the Share Scheme.
(e)
             
 
If the Share Scheme becomes Effective, then on the Implementation Date, all of the Scheme Shares will be transferred to Constellation Australia without the need for any further act by any Scheme Shareholder by BRL procuring the delivery of a transfer or transfers in respect of all of the Scheme Shares to the ASX Settlement and Transfer Corporation Pty Limited by a broker nominated in writing by Constellation Australia to effect a valid transfer of the Scheme Shares to Constellation Australia under section 1074D of the Corporations Act, or, if such procedure is not available for any reason, by:
(f)
               
 
BRL Hardy delivering to Constellation Australia a duly completed and executed share transfer form or forms to transfer all of the Scheme Shares to Constellation Australia;
 - 
                        
 
Constellation Australia executing and delivering to BRL Hardy the share transfer form or forms; and
 - 
                        
 
BRL Hardy entering the name of Constellation Australia in the Register as the holder of all of the Scheme Shares.
 - 
                        
 
If the Share Scheme becomes Effective then within 5 days after the Implementation Date Constellation Australia will pay to Scheme Shareholders the Share Scheme Consideration.
(g)
            
 
The Share Scheme will lapse and be of no further force or effect if the Implementation Deed is terminated.
(h)
            
 
2.4
                              
Termination of the Implementation Deed
 
The Share Scheme is conditional upon the Implementation Deed not having been terminated as at the Court Hearing Time.
The Implementation Deed may be terminated:
 
if certain of the Conditions are not capable of being satisfied, or are not reasonably capable of being satisfied, and have not previously been waived;
(a)
             
 
by Constellation giving notice to BRL Hardy in writing if:
(b)
            
 
BRL Hardy is in material breach in any respect of its obligations under the No Solicitation Agreement at any time before the Second Court Date;
(i)
                 
 
BRL Hardy is in material breach of its obligations under clause 8.1 of the Implementation Deed at any time before the Second Court Date and has not rectified that breach within 5 Business Days after it is given notice by Constellation requiring that breach to be rectified; or
(ii)
              
 
a majority of the BRL Board:
(iii)
           
 
withdraws or changes the recommendation of the Merger given by the BRL Board in accordance with the terms of the Implementation Deed; or
A.
              
 
recommends or supports, or enters into any agreement, arrangement or understanding to recommend or support a Third Party Proposal;
B.
                
 
by BRL Hardy giving notice to Constellation in writing if Constellation is in material breach of its obligations under clause 8.2 of the Implementation Deed at any time before the Second Court Date and has not rectified that breach within 5 Business Days after it is given notice by BRL Hardy requiring that breach to be rectified;
(c)
              
 
by either Constellation or BRL Hardy giving notice to the other in writing if:
(d)
             
 
the Implementation Date shall not have occurred on or prior to the 30 April 2003;
(i)
                
 
at the Scheme Meeting relating to the Share Scheme or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the Share Scheme is not approved by the necessary majority of the BRL Shareholders; or
(ii)
             
 
any court or Governmental Authority has issued any order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, or has refused to do anything necessary to permit the Merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and not appealable.
(iii)
          
 
2.5
                              
Court ordered meeting of BRL Shareholders
 
On 10 February 2003, the Court ordered that a meeting of BRL Shareholders be convened to consider the Share Scheme. This meeting is to be held on 20 March 2003 at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia commencing at 10.00 am (Adelaide time).
 
The notice convening this meeting is set out in Section 16 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
Each BRL Shareholder who is registered on the Register at 10.00 pm (Adelaide time) on 18 March 2003 is entitled to attend and vote, in person or by proxy or attorney or, in the case of a corporation which is a shareholder, by its representative appointed in accordance with the Corporations Act, at the Share Scheme Meeting.
 
For actions to be taken by BRL Shareholders who propose to attend and vote at the Share Scheme Meeting or to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on the shareholder's behalf, see page 12 above.
 
2.6
                              
Voting majority required
 
The voting majority to approve the Share Scheme requires votes in favour of the Share Scheme to be received from:
 
a majority in number (more than 50%) of BRL Shareholders present and voting at the Share Scheme Meeting (in person, by proxy, by attorney or, in the case of corporate BRL Shareholders, by corporate representative); and
(a)
             
 
(b) BRL Shareholders who together hold at least 75% of the total number of BRL Shares voted at the Share Scheme Meeting.
 
2.7
                              
Opposing the Share Scheme
 
The Corporations Act and the Corporations Rules 2000 of South Australia provide a procedure for BRL Shareholders to oppose the approval by the Court of the Share Scheme. If you are a BRL Shareholder and
wish to oppose the approval of the Share Scheme at the Second Court Hearing you may do so by filing with the Court and serving on BRL Hardy a notice of appearance in the prescribed form together with any affidavit on which you wish to rely at the hearing. The notice of appearance and affidavit must be served on BRL Hardy at least one day before the date fixed for the Second Court Hearing. That date is currently scheduled to occur on 27 March 2003. Any change to this date will be announced through the ASX and notified on BRL Hardy's website, www.brlhardy.com.au.
 
If a BRL Shareholder does not object in accordance with these procedures, such holder may not have a right to appear at the Second Court Hearing, although the Court in its discretion could, and likely would, permit such a holder to state objections to the Court if the holder made a personal appearance at the Second Court Hearing.
 
If there is an objection to the Share Scheme, and in such event the Second Court Hearing is continued or adjourned, then the date of the continued or adjourned hearing will be announced through the ASX and on BRL Hardy's website.
2.8         
Effective Date
 
The Share Scheme will become Effective on the date when an office copy of the order of the Court approving the Share Scheme is lodged with ASIC or such earlier date as the Court determines and specifies in the Court order.
 
BRL Hardy will notify the ASX upon the Share Scheme becoming Effective.
 
Once the Share Scheme becomes Effective, BRL Hardy and Constellation will become bound to implement and Constellation will procure that Constellation Australia implements the Share Scheme in accordance with its terms.
 
2.9         
Determination of persons entitled to Share Scheme Consideration
 
(a)
             
Dealings on or prior to Record Date
 
For the purpose of establishing who are Scheme Shareholders, dealings in BRL Shares will be recognised provided that:
 
in the case of dealings of the type to be effected using CHESS, the transferee is registered in the Register as a holder of the relevant BRL Shares by 10.00 pm on the Record Date; and
(i)
                 
 
in all other cases, registrable transfers or transmission applications in respect of those dealings are received at or before 10.00 pm on the Record Date at the place where the Register is kept.
(ii)
              
 
BRL Hardy must register transfers or transmission applications of the type referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) by 10.00 pm on the Record Date. BRL Hardy will not accept for registration or recognise for any purpose any transmission application or transfer in respect of BRL Shares received after 10.00 pm on the Record Date (other than a transfer of BRL Shares to Constellation Australia in the course of implementing the Share Scheme).
 
(b)
             
Dealings after Record Date
 
For the purpose of determining entitlements to the Share Scheme Consideration, BRL Hardy will, until the Share Scheme Consideration has been paid and issued in accordance with the Share Scheme, maintain the Register in accordance with the provisions of clause 7 of the Share Scheme and the Register in this form will solely determine entitlements to the Share Scheme Consideration. As from 10.00 pm on the Record Date, each entry current on the Register relating to Scheme Shares will cease to be of any effect other than as evidence of entitlement to the Share Scheme Consideration in respect of the Scheme Shares relating to that entry.
 
All certificates and statements of holding for Scheme Shares shall from 10.00 pm on the Record Date cease to have any effect as documents of title in respect of such Scheme Shares other than for the purpose of registering dealings in the Scheme Shares as referred to in Section 2.9(a).
 
(c)
             
Provision of Information
 
BRL Hardy must give to Constellation, no less than one Business Day prior to the Implementation Date, details of the names, registered addresses and holdings of Scheme Shares of every Scheme Shareholder as shown in the Share Register at 10.00 pm on the Record Date, such details to be provided in such form as Constellation may reasonably require.
2.10
                       
Provision of Share Scheme Consideration
 
Within 5 Business Days after the Implementation Date, cheques payable to Scheme Shareholders in respect of Cash Consideration, stock certificates in respect of Constellation Shares issued as Scrip Consideration and holding statements in respect of Constellation CDIs issued as Scrip Consideration (as the case may be) will be sent by prepaid post to each Scheme Shareholder at the person's address as shown on the Register.
 
In the case of joint holdings, any cheques payable to Scheme Shareholders and any stock certificates or holding statements will be forwarded to the address which stands first on the Register.
 
2.11
                       
Suspension of trading of BRL Shares
 
If the Court approves the Share Scheme, BRL Hardy will notify the ASX of the Court approval on the day of the Court hearing to approve the Share Scheme. It is expected that suspension of trading on the ASX in BRL Shares will occur from the close of business on that day.
 
If the Share Scheme becomes Effective, Constellation will cause BRL Hardy to apply for termination of official quotation of BRL Shares on the first Business Day after the Implementation Date.
 
2.12
                       
Stamp duty
 
No stamp duty is payable on the transfer of shares in a listed company.
 
2.13
                       
Financial assistance
 
(a)
             
General Meeting
 
BRL Hardy has convened a General Meeting to be held at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King Williams Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003 commencing at 10.30 am (Adelaide time), or as soon after that time as the Share Scheme Meeting has concluded or is adjourned, for the purpose of passing the Resolution.
 
The notice convening this meeting is set out in Section 17 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
For actions to be taken by BRL Shareholders who propose to attend and vote at the General Meeting or to appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf, see page 12 above.
 
(b)
             
Corporations Act provisions
 
Section 260A(1) of the Corporations Act relevantly provides that a company may financially assist a person to acquire shares in that company if the assistance is approved by shareholders by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by the person acquiring the shares or by their associates, or by a resolution agreed to at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders.
 
Section 260B(4) of the Corporations Act requires that a notice convening a general meeting of members to consider a resolution to approve the giving of financial assistance to a person to acquire shares in a company must include a statement setting out all the information known to the company that is material to the decision on how to vote on the resolution.
 
(c)
             
Particulars of financial assistance
 
Options issued to the employees of BRL Hardy under its Employee Option Plan and NonExecutive Options issued to non-executive directors under the Non-Executive Option Plan give the holders of those options the right to acquire BRL Shares at future points in time at a certain exercise price. These options therefore represent a contingent right to own BRL Shares in the future.
 
On 17 January 2003, Constellation and BRL Hardy entered into the Implementation Deed in relation to the Merger and under which Constellation and BRL Hardy agreed that:
 
BRL Hardy will propose the Option Scheme, which if implemented will result in the cancellation of all Options in return for the payment by BRL Hardy of the Option Scheme Consideration;
(i)
                 
 
BRL Hardy will within one month from the date of the Implementation Deed, make an offer to each holder of Non-Executive Options to cancel the Non-Executive Options held by that person in consideration for the payment by BRL Hardy of $2.42 per Non-Executive Option cancelled;
(ii)
              
subject to the Option Scheme becoming Effective, Constellation Australia will make available to BRL Hardy a credit facility on arms length commercial terms to enable BRL Hardy to fund the Option Scheme Consideration and the consideration payable to each holder of Non-Executive Options for the cancellation of those Non-Executive Options.
(iii)
           
 
All of these arrangements are conditional upon the Share Scheme becoming effective which would then result in all of the BRL Shares being transferred to Constellation Australia. Furthermore, the cancellation of the Options and the Non-Executive Options will ensure that there are no outstanding rights for the issue of new shares in BRL Hardy. Accordingly the Directors believe that, by entering into these arrangements, BRL Hardy is financially assisting Constellation Australia to acquire BRL Shares under the Share Scheme.
 
The Directors believe that the provision of the proposed financial assistance will be of benefit to the Company because it will assist in the implementation of the Merger which the Directors and the Independent Expert believe, in the absence of a higher offer, is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders. Futhermore, the credit facility summarised in paragraph (iii) above (referred to in this Scheme Booklet as the "", is being provided to BRL Hardy on the basis that it will be converted to capital in BRL Hardy by Constellation Australia shortly after the Schemes have been implemented. The Directors believe that such loan arrangement will not be prejudicial to creditors of BRL Hardy. Accordingly, the Directors have proposed that the provision of such financial assistance by BRL Hardy be approved by BRL Shareholders in accordance with section 260B of the Corporations Act. If the Resolution is not passed by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders then the Option Scheme will not take effect.
Option Cancellation Loan
 
The Directors of BRL Hardy have unanimously recommended that BRL Shareholders approve the Resolution. All Directors who hold BRL Shares intend to vote in favour of the Resolution.
 
(d)
             
Voting on the resolution to approve the financial assistance
 
The resolution to approve the financial assistance is a special resolution which must be carried by a majority of 75% of the votes cast on the resolution by BRL Shareholders present at the General Meeting in person or by proxy.  Constellation and any person who is an associate of Constellation may not vote on the resolution.

Historical Development of Constellation
 
Constellation is a Delaware corporation incorporated on 4 December 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945. Since the founding of Constellation's business in 1945 as a producer and marketer of wine products, the business has grown through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Internal growth has been driven by leveraging Constellation's existing portfolio of leading brands, developing new products, new packaging and line extensions, and focusing on the faster growing sectors of the beverage alcohol industry. Since 1991, Constellation has completed a number of major acquisitions that have broadened its portfolio and increased market share, net sales and cash flow. In the past five years Constellation has acquired Ravenswood Winery, Inc., certain assets of Corus Brands, Inc. and the Turner Road Vintners Assets (as defined in Section 3.5(b) below) in 2001, Forth Wines Limited ("Forth Wines") in 2000, Franciscan Vineyards, Inc. ("Franciscan Estates"), Simi Winery, Inc. ("Simi") and the Black Velvet Assets (as defined in Section 3.5(b) below) in 1999, and Matthew Clark plc ("Matthew Clark") in 1998.
 
On 31 July 2001, Constellation and BRL Hardy completed the formation of Pacific Wine Partners, a joint venture owned equally by Constellation and BRL Hardy. On 16 October 2001, Constellation announced that Pacific Wine Partners completed the purchase of certain assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand.
 
The investment in Pacific Wine Partners is accounted for using the equity method. Accordingly, the results of operations of Pacific Wine Partners since 31 July 2001 have been included in the equity in earnings of joint venture line in the consolidated statements of income of Constellation. Leading brands in the Pacific Wine Partners portfolio include Banrock Station as well as Blackstone.

Constellation Operations
 
(a)

Its other wine-related products and services include bulk wine, cooking wine, grape juice and St. Regis Inglenook, a leading de-alcoholized line of wine in the United States.
 
Imported Beer and Spirits
 
The Imported Beer and Spirits segment imports and markets a diversified line of beer and produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line of distilled spirits. It is the third largest marketer of imported beer in the United States and distributes six of the top 25 imported beer brands in the United States: Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, Corona Light, Pacifico, St. Pauli Girl, and Negra Modelo. Corona Extra is the best selling imported beer in the United States.

The Imported Beer and Spirits segment also sells distilled spirits in bulk and provides contract production and bottling services for third parties.
 
U.K. Brands and Wholesale
 
The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment is a leading producer and marketer of wine, cider and bottled water. In addition, it is the leading independent on-premise drinks wholesaler throughout the United Kingdom. This segment also exports its branded products to approximately 45 countries from the United Kingdom.
 
The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's Stowells of Chelsea brand is the best selling branded table wine in the on-premise market and the third best selling in the off-premise market in the United Kingdom. This segment is the largest supplier of branded wine to the on-premise trade and a leading supplier to the off-premise trade in the United Kingdom. It maintains a leading market share position in fortified British wine through its QC and Stone's brand names and a strong market position in the wine style drinks category through Babycham, Country Manor and Arbor Mist.
 
The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment is the second largest producer and marketer of cider in the United Kingdom. This segment distributes its cider brands in both the on-premise and off-premise markets. Its leading cider brands include Blackthorn, the number two cider brand in the United Kingdom, Gaymer's Olde English, Diamond White and K. It also produces and markets Strathmore bottled water in the United Kingdom.
 
The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment is the leading independent beverage wholesaler to the on-premise trade in the United Kingdom and has one of the largest customer bases in the United Kingdom, with more than 16,000 on-premise accounts. Its wholesaling business involves the distribution of branded wine, distilled spirits, cider, beer and soft drinks.

(b)
             
Marketing and distribution
 
North America
 
Constellation's products are distributed and sold throughout North America through over 1,000 wholesalers, as well as through state and provincial alcoholic beverage control agencies. The Popular and Premium Wine, Imported Beer and Spirits and Fine Wine segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service organizations to develop and service their sales to wholesalers and state agencies.
 
Constellation believes that the organisation of its sales force into separate segments positions it to maintain a high degree of focus on each of its principal product categories. However, where appropriate, Constellation leverages its sales and marketing skills across the organisation, particularly in national accounts.
 
Constellation's marketing strategy places primary emphasis upon promotional programs directed at its broad national distribution network, and at the retailers served by that network. Constellation has extensive marketing programs for its brands including promotional programs on both a national basis and regional basis in accordance with the strength of the brands, point-of-sale materials, consumer media advertising, event sponsorship, market research, trade advertising and public relations.
 
United Kingdom
 
Constellation's U.K.-produced branded products are distributed throughout the United Kingdom by the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment. The products are packaged at one of three production facilities. Shipments of cider and wine are then made to the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's national distribution centre for branded products. All branded products are then distributed to either the on-premise or off-premise markets with some of the sales to on-premise customers made through the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's wholesale business.
 
This segment's wholesale products are distributed through 11 depots located throughout the United Kingdom. On-premise distribution channels include hotels, restaurants, pubs, wine bars and clubs. The off-premise distribution channels include grocers, convenience retail and cash-and-carry outlets.
 
The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment employs full-time, in-house marketing and sales organizations that separately target or service the off-premise customers and the on-premise market in the United Kingdom for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's branded products and the customers of its wholesale business.
 
(c)
             
Trademarks and distribution agreements
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of Constellation's business. Constellation sells its products under a number of trademarks, most of which Constellation owns. Throughout its segments, Constellation also has various licenses and distribution agreements, for the production and/or sale of its products, as well as for the sale of products of third parties. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations. Agreements include, among others, a long-term license agreement with Hiram Walker & Sons, Inc., which expires in 2116, for the Ten High, Crystal Palace, Northern Light and Imperial Spirits brands; and a long-term license agreement with the B. Manischewitz Company, which expires in 2042, for the Manischewitz brand of kosher wine.
 
All of Constellation's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products. These agreements have terms that vary and prohibit Constellation from importing other beer from other producers from the same country. Constellation's agreement to distribute Corona Extra and other Mexican beer brands exclusively throughout 25 primarily western U.S. states expires in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria, continued retention of certain Constellation personnel and other terms under the agreement, will be automatically renewed for additional terms of five years. Changes in control of Constellation or of its subsidiaries involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, changes in the position of the Chief Executive Officer of Barton Beers, Ltd., including by death or disability, or the termination of the employment of the President of Barton Incorporated, may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such changes, to terminate the agreement. The supplier's consent to such changes may not be unreasonably withheld. Constellation's agreement for the importation of St. Pauli Girl expires in December 2007. Prior to their expiration, these agreements may be terminated if Constellation fails to meet certain performance criteria.
 
Constellation believes it is currently in compliance with its material imported beer distribution agreements. From time to time, Constellation has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain performance criteria in its distribution agreements. Although there can be no assurance that Constellation's beer distribution agreements will be renewed, given Constellation's long-term relationships with its suppliers, Constellation expects that such agreements will be renewed prior to their expiration and does not believe that these agreements will be terminated.
 
(d)
             
Production
 
In the United States, Constellation's wine is produced from several varieties of wine grapes grown principally in California. The grapes are crushed at Constellation's wineries and stored as wine, grape juice or concentrate. Such grape products may be made into wine for sale under Constellation's brand names, sold to other companies for resale under their own labels, or shipped to customers in the form of juice, juice concentrate, unfinished wine, high-proof grape spirits or brandy.
Most of Constellation's wine is bottled and sold within 18 months after the grape crush. Constellation's inventories of wine, grape juice and concentrate are usually at their highest levels in November and December immediately after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and are substantially reduced prior to the subsequent year's crush.
 
The bourbon whiskeys, domestic blended whiskeys and light whiskeys marketed by Constellation are primarily produced and aged by Constellation at its distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky. Following the Black Velvet Assets acquisition, the majority of Constellation's Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at its Canadian distilleries in Lethbridge, Alberta, and Valleyfield, Quebec.
 
At its Albany, Georgia, facility, Constellation produces all of the neutral grain spirits and whiskeys it uses in the production of vodka, gin and blended whiskey it sells to customers in the state of Georgia. Constellation's requirements of scotch whisky, tequila, mezcal and the neutral grain spirits it uses in the production of gin and vodka for sale outside of Georgia, and other spirits products, are purchased from various suppliers.
 
Constellation operates three facilities in the United Kingdom that produce, bottle and package cider, wine and water. To produce Stowells of Chelsea, wine is imported in bulk from various countries such as Australia, Chile, Germany, France, Spain, South Africa and the United States, which is then packaged at Constellation's facility at Bristol and distributed under the Stowells of Chelsea brand name. The Bristol facility also produces fortified British wine and wine style drinks.
 
All cider production takes place at Constellation's facility at Shepton Mallet, where apples of many different varieties are purchased from U.K. growers and crushed. This juice, along with European-sourced concentrate, is then fermented into cider, blended and then packaged. The Strathmore brand of bottled water (which is available in still, sparkling, and flavoured varieties) is sourced and bottled in Forfar, Scotland.
 
Constellation operates one winery in Chile that crushes, vinifies, cellars and bottles wine.
 
(e)
             
Sources and availability of raw materials
 
The principal components in the production of Constellation's branded beverage alcohol products are packaging materials (primarily glass) and agricultural products, such as grapes and grain. Constellation utilizes glass and polyethylene terephthalate ("pet") bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of its products.
 
Glass bottle costs are one of the largest components of Constellation's cost of product sold. The glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. Constellation has traditionally obtained, and continues to obtain, its glass requirements from a limited number of producers.
 
Constellation has not experienced difficulty in satisfying its requirements with respect to any of the foregoing and considers its sources of supply to be adequate. However, the inability of any of Constellation's glass bottle suppliers to satisfy Constellation's requirements could adversely affect Constellation's operations.
 
Most of Constellation's annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year's harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October. Constellation believes that it has adequate sources of grape supplies to meet its sales expectations. However, in the event demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, Constellation could experience shortages.
 
Constellation purchases grapes from approximately 800 independent growers, principally in the San Joaquin Valley and Central and North Coast regions of California. Constellation enters into written purchase agreements with a majority of these growers on a year-to-year basis.
 
Constellation currently owns or leases approximately 6,500 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in California, New York and Chile. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of Constellation's total needs. Constellation continues to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement its grape supply.
 
The distilled spirits manufactured by Constellation require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits. Constellation fulfils its requirements through purchases from various sources through contractual arrangements and through purchases on the open market. Constellation believes that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.
 
In the United Kingdom, Constellation manufactures wine and cider from materials that are purchased either on a contracted basis or on the open market. In particular, supplies of cider apples are sourced through long-term supply arrangements with owners of apple orchards. There are adequate supplies of the various raw materials at this particular time.
 
(f)
               
Government regulation
 
Constellation's operations in the United States are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. These regulations cover, among other matters, sales promotion, advertising and public relations, labelling and packaging, changes in officers or directors, ownership or control, distribution methods and relationships, and requirements regarding brand registration and the posting of prices and price changes.
 
All of Constellation's operations and facilities are also subject to federal, state, foreign and local environmental laws and regulations and Constellation is required to obtain permits and licenses to operate its facilities.
In the United Kingdom, Constellation has secured a Customs and Excise License to carry on its excise trade. Licenses are required for all premises where wine is produced. Constellation also holds a license to act as an excise warehouse operator.
 
In Canada, Constellation's operations are also subject to extensive federal and provincial regulation. These regulations cover, among other matters, advertising and public relations, labelling and packaging, environmental matters and customs and duty requirements. Constellation is also required to obtain licenses and permits to operate its facilities.
 
(g)
            
Competition
 
The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. Constellation competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution. Constellation's beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, a presence in restaurants and marketing focus by Constellation's wholesalers.
 
Constellation competes with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which may have greater resources than Constellation. In the United States, the Popular and Premium Wine segment's principal competitors include E & J Gallo Winery and The Wine Group.

3.4
                              
Selected Financial Data
 
The following table sets forth Constellation's selected financial data as of and for each of the nine month periods ended 30 November 2002 and 2001, and as of the end of and for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended 28 February 2002.
 
The income statement data for the three fiscal years in the period ended 28 February 2002, and the balance sheet data as of 28 February 2002 and 2001, have been derived from Constellation's audited historical financial statements included in Annexure 1 to this Scheme Booklet, which financial statements were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP.  In May 2002, Constellation terminated its relationship with Arthur Andersen LLP and retained KPMG LLP as its independent public accountants.  The balance sheet data as of 29 February 2000, and the income statement data and the balance sheet data as of and for the fiscal years ended 28 February 1999 and 1998, have also been derived from Constellation's audited historical financial statements.  The income statement data and the balance sheet data as of and for the nine month periods ended 30 November 2002 and 2001 have been derived from Constellation's unaudited historical financial statements, portions of which are included in Annexure 1 to this Scheme Booklet.
 
Beginning 1 March 2002, Constellation adopted U.S. Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF No. 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of a Vendor's Products)." As a result, since 1 March 2002 Constellation has classified certain promotional expenditures paid to distributors, retailers or consumers as a reduction of revenue and non-cash consideration as an increase to cost of product sold. Constellation previously reported these expenses as selling, general and administrative expenses.
 
This reclassification, which does not affect operating income or net income, is reflected in the financial information for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 presented in the following table and in Constellation's interim consolidated financial statements for such period. In addition, the financial information for the nine months ended 30 November 2001 presented in the following table and in such interim consolidated financial statements has been reclassified to comply with this guidance.
Financial information for periods ended 28 February 2002 and previously will be reclassified to comply with this guidance commencing with Constellation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 28 February 2003 to be filed with the U.S. SEC by 29 May 2003. The reclassification for such prior periods, which is not reflected in the following table, will result in the following adjustments to Constellation's reported results.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
(a)     Introduction
 
Constellation is a leader in the production and marketing of beverage alcohol brands in North America and the United Kingdom. As the second largest supplier of wine, the second largest marketer of imported beer and the third largest supplier of distilled spirits, Constellation is the largest single-source supplier of these products in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Constellation is a leading producer and marketer of wine and cider and a leading independent drinks wholesaler.
 
Constellation reports its operating results in five segments: Popular and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine, cider, and bottled water, and wholesale wine, cider, distilled spirits, beer and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super-premium and ultra-premium wine); and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items).
 
The following discussion and analysis summarises the significant factors affecting (i) consolidated results of operations of Constellation for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 ("Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002"), compared to the nine months ended 30 November 2001 ("Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001"), (ii) consolidated results of operations of Constellation for the year ended 28 February 2002 ("Fiscal 2002"), compared to the year ended 28 February 2001 ("Fiscal 2001"), and (iii) aspects of Constellation's financial liquidity and capital resources as at 30 November 2002, for the Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 and for Fiscal 2002. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Constellation's Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Scheme Booklet as Annexure 1 herein.
 
As further discussed in the notes to Constellation's Consolidated Financial Statements and under the heading "Accounting Pronouncements" below in this Section 3, Constellation adopted SFAS No. 142 and EITF No. 01-09 on 1 March 2002.
 
During April 2002, the Board of Directors of Constellation approved a two-for-one stock split of both Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on 13 May 2002, to stockholders of record on 30 April 2002. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to give effect to the common stock split.
 
(b)     Recent Acquisitions and Joint Venture with BRL Hardy
 
Acquisition of Ravenswood Winery
 
On 2 July 2001, Constellation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. (the "Ravenswood Acquisition"), a leading premium wine producer based in Sonoma, California. On 30 June 2002, Ravenswood Winery, Inc. was merged into Franciscan Estates (a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation). The Ravenswood business produces, markets and sells super-premium and ultra-premium California wine primarily under the Ravenswood brand name. The vast majority of wine the Ravenswood business produces and sells is red wine, including the number one super-premium Zinfandel in the United States. The results of operations of the Ravenswood business are reported in the Fine Wine segment and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of Constellation since the date of acquisition.

(c)     Results of Operations
 
(i)     Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 Compared To Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001
 
Net Sales
 
The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of U.S. dollars) by operating segment of Constellation for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 and Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001.
Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 Compared to Nine Months Ended
30 November 2001
 
Net Sales
 
Net sales for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 increased to US$2,078.6 million from US$1,989.4 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$89.2 million, or 4.5%. Excluding a favourable foreign currency impact of US$29.9 million, net sales increased US$59.3 million, or 3.0%, primarily from increased sales of imported beer. Also contributing to the sales growth were increases in U.K. wholesale, fine wine and spirits sales offset by lower bulk wine, grape juice concentrate, branded wine and U.K. branded sales.
 
Popular and Premium Wine
 
Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 decreased to US$561.3 million from US$584.8 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, a decrease of US$23.5 million, or (4.0)%. Other sales declined US$13.8 million, or (24.4)%, on lower bulk wine and grape juice concentrate sales. Branded sales declined US$9.7 million, or (1.8)%, on lower volume. Volumes were negatively impacted, primarily in the second quarter of Constellation's fiscal year, as a result of increased promotional spending in the industry, which Constellation did not participate in heavily.
 
Imported Beer and Spirits
 
Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 increased to US$834.5 million from US$784.6 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$49.9 million, or 6.4%. This increase resulted primarily from a US$44.9 million increase in imported beer sales. The growth in imported beer sales is primarily due to a price increase on Constellation's Mexican beer portfolio, which took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, and increased volume. Spirits sales increased US$5.0 million resulting primarily from bulk whiskey sales growth partially offset by slightly lower branded sales.
 
U.K. Brands and Wholesale
 
Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 increased to US$588.5 million from US$543.8 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$44.7 million, or 8.2%. Excluding a favourable foreign currency impact of US$29.9 million, net sales increased US$14.8 million, or 2.7%. This increase resulted primarily from a 6.0% increase in wholesale sales due to the addition of new accounts and increased average delivery sizes, partially offset by a 4.0% decline in branded sales as a decrease in cider sales was partially offset by increases in wine sales.
 
Fine Wine
 
Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 increased to US$112.0 million from US$95.1 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$16.9 million, or 17.8%. This increase resulted primarily from an additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition, completed in July 2001, as well as growth primarily in the Simi brand. Excluding the additional four months of sales of US$14.1 million of the acquired brands, Fine Wine net sales increased US$2.8 million, or 3.0%, due to higher sales volumes led by Simi and Ravenswood, partially offset by higher promotional activity and a shift towards lower priced brands.
 
Gross Profit
 
Constellation's gross profit increased to US$583.5 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from US$532.3 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$51.2 million, or 9.6%. The dollar increase in gross profit resulted from higher imported beer sales, the additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition (completed in July 2001), a favourable mix of sales towards higher margin products, particularly popular and premium wine and tequila, lower average wine and spirits costs, and a favourable foreign currency impact. These increases were partially offset by higher average imported beer costs and lower concentrate and bulk wine sales. As a result of the foregoing, gross profit as a percent of net sales
increased to 28.1% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from 26.8% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001.
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to US$263.8 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from US$264.5 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, a decrease of US$0.7 million, or (0.3)%. Constellation adopted SFAS No. 142 on 1 March 2002 and accordingly, stopped amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Excluding US$19.4 million of amortization expense from Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, Constellation's selling, general and administrative expenses increased US$18.7 million, or 7.6%. This increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs to support Constellation's growth and higher selling costs to support the growth in the U.K. wholesale business. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.7% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 as compared to 13.3% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001. Excluding amortization expense in Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 12.7% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 as compared to 12.3% for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001. This increase was primarily due to (i) the percent increase in general and administrative expenses growing at a faster rate than the percent change in the Corporate Operations and Other, Popular and Premium Wine and U.K. Brands and Wholesale segments' net sales, and (ii) the percent increase in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's selling costs being greater than the percent increase in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's net sales.
 
Operating Income
 
The following table sets forth the operating income/(loss) (in thousands of U.S. dollars) by operating segment of Constellation for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 and Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001.
 
Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002
 
Compared to Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001
 
Operating Income/(Loss)
 
 
As a result of the above factors, consolidated operating income increased to US$319.6 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from US$267.7 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$51.9 million, or 19.4%. Excluding amortization expense for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, operating income for Popular and Premium Wine, Imported Beer and Spirits, U.K. Brands and Wholesale and Fine Wine would have been US$81.3 million, US$149.4 million, US$44.6 million and US$31.5 million, respectively. Further, consolidated operating income would have been US$287.1 million.
 
Interest Expense, Net
 
Net interest expense decreased to US$80.5 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from US$86.4 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, a decrease of US$5.9 million, or (6.8)%. The decrease resulted from both a decrease in the average interest rate and a decrease in the average borrowings for the period.
 
Net Income
 
As a result of the above factors, net income increased to US$151.3 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 from US$109.4 million for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, an increase of US$41.9 million, or 38.3%. Excluding amortization expense and the associated income tax benefit for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2001, net income increased US$28.2 million, or 22.9%.
 
(ii)    Fiscal 2002 Compared To Fiscal 2001
 
Net Sales
 
The following table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of U.S. dollars) by operating segment of Constellation for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.
 
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
 
Net Sales
 
 
Net sales for Fiscal 2002 increased to US$2,820.5 million from US$2,396.7 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$423.8 million, or 17.7%.
 
Popular and Premium Wine
 
Net sales for the Popular and Premium Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to US$862.8 million from US$691.8 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$171.0 million, or 24.7%. This increase resulted primarily from US$188.1 million of sales of the newly acquired brands from the Turner Road Vintners Assets and Corus Assets acquisitions (the "March 2001 Acquisitions"), both completed in March 2001. This increase was partially offset by declines in the Popular and Premium Wine segment's grape juice concentrate business and certain other wine brands.
 
Imported Beer and Spirits
 
Net sales for the Imported Beer and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to US$1,047.4 million from US$945.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$102.3 million, or 10.8%. This increase resulted primarily from a 15.1% increase in imported beer sales, led by volume growth in the Mexican beer portfolio. Spirits sales increased slightly primarily from an increase in bulk whiskey sales, partially offset by slightly lower branded spirits sales as a result of lower net selling prices from the implementation of a net pricing strategy in the third quarter of Fiscal 2001, which also resulted in lower promotion costs.
 
U.K. Brands and Wholesale
 
Net sales for the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to US$792.9 million from US$691.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$101.8 million, or 14.7%. Excluding an adverse foreign currency impact of US$28.9 million, net sales increased US$130.7 million, or 18.9%. This local currency basis increase resulted primarily from a 27.1% increase in wholesale sales, with the majority of this growth coming from organic sales. Additionally, branded sales increased 7.4% with an increase in wine sales being partially offset by a decrease in cider sales.
 
Fine Wine
 
Net sales for the Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to US$142.2 million from US$93.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$49.1 million, or 52.7%. This increase resulted primarily from US$32.9 million of sales of the newly acquired brands from the Ravenswood acquisition and organic sales growth primarily due to volume increases in the Estancia, Veramonte, and Franciscan brands.
 
Gross Profit
 
Constellation's gross profit increased to US$919.0 million for Fiscal 2002 from US$757.5 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$161.6 million, or 21.3%. The dollar increase in gross profit resulted primarily from sales of the newly acquired brands from the March 2001 Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, volume growth in the Imported Beer and Spirits segment's Mexican beer portfolio, volume growth in the Fine Wine segment's portfolio, and volume growth in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's wholesale business and branded business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Imported Beer and Spirits segment's spirits sales and an adverse foreign currency impact. As a percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 32.6% for Fiscal 2002 from 31.6% for Fiscal 2001, resulting primarily from sales of higher-margin wine brands acquired in the March 2001 Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition.
 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to US$576.6 million for Fiscal 2002 from US$486.6 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $90.0 million, or 18.5%. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase in advertising, promotion, selling, and general and administrative expenses associated with the brands acquired in the March 2001 Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition.
In addition, there were increases in promotion and advertising expenses associated with the Imported Beer and Spirits segment's Mexican beer portfolio volume growth, the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's branded business volume growth, and the Fine Wine segment's portfolio volume growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales remained virtually unchanged at 20.4% for Fiscal 2002 as compared to 20.3% for Fiscal 2001.
 
Operating Income
 
The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of U.S. dollars) by operating segment of Constellation for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.
 
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
 
Operating Income (Loss)
 
 
As a result of the above factors, operating income increased to US$342.5 million for Fiscal 2002 from US$270.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$71.6 million, or 26.4%.
 
Interest Expense, Net
 
Net interest expense increased to US$114.2 million for Fiscal 2002 from US$108.6 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$5.6 million, or 5.1%. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average borrowings primarily due to the financing of the March 2001 Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate.
 
Net Income
 
As a result of the above factors, net income increased to US$136.4 million for Fiscal 2002 from US$97.3 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of US$39.1 million, or 40.1%.
 
(d)     Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
(i)     Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 Cash Flows
 
Operating Activities
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 was US$147.3 million, which resulted from US$192.9 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less US$45.6 million representing the net change in Constellation's operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from seasonal increases in inventories and accounts receivable offset by increases in accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued grape purchases.
 
Investing Activities and Financing Activities
 
Net cash used in investing activities for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 was US$52.5 million, which resulted primarily from US$51.8 million of capital expenditures.
 
Net cash used in financing activities for Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 was US$75.1 million resulting primarily from US$62.5 million of principal payments of long-term debt and US$49.4 million of net repayments of notes payable. These amounts were partially offset by US$25.5 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises and US$10.0 million of proceeds from long-term debt which was used for the repayment of debt at one of Constellation's Chilean subsidiaries.
 
During June 1998, Constellation's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to US$100.0 million of Constellation's Shares and Constellation B Shares. The repurchase of shares of common stock will be accomplished, from time to time, in management's discretion and depending upon market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Constellation may finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or through the senior credit facility. The repurchased shares will become treasury shares. As of 10 January 2003, Constellation had purchased 4,075,344 Constellation Shares at an aggregate cost of US$44.9 million, or at an average cost of US$11.01 per share. No shares were repurchased during Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002.
 
(ii)    Fiscal 2002 Cash Flows
 
Operating Activities
 
Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2002 was US$213.3 million, which resulted from US$226.3 million in net income adjusted for noncash items, less US$13.0 million representing the net change in Constellation's operating assets and liabilities. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from increases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued salaries and commissions, and accrued advertising and promotions.
 
Investing Activities And Financing Activities
 
Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2002 was US$585.4 million, which resulted from net cash paid of US$472.8 million for the March 2001 Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition, US$77.3 million of equity contributions to PWP and US$71.1 million of capital expenditures (including US$10.1 million for vineyards), partially offset by US$35.8 million of proceeds from the sale of assets.
 
Net cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2002 was US$236.9 million, which resulted primarily from proceeds of US$252.5 million from the issuance
of long-term debt, including US$250.0 million of 8 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes used to repay US$130.0 million of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes and US$65.0 million of 8 3/4% Series C Senior Subordinated Notes and a portion of Constellation's borrowings under its senior credit facility, net proceeds of US$151.5 million from equity offerings, proceeds of US$51.4 million from net revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility, and proceeds of US$45.0 million from exercise of employee stock options. These amounts were partially offset by principal payments of long-term debt of US$261.0 million, which included the repayments as discussed above and US$54.7 million of scheduled or required principal payments under Constellation's senior credit facility.
 
(iii)   Debt
 
Total debt outstanding as of 30 November 2002, amounted to US$1,354.1 million, a decrease of US$75.5 million from 28 February 2002. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization decreased to 54.1% as of 30 November 2002, from 59.9% as of 28 February 2002.
 
Senior Credit Facilities
 
Existing Credit Facility
 
As of 30 November 2002, under its existing senior credit facility, Constellation had outstanding term loans of US$232.5 million bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%, US$4.5 million of revolving loans bearing a weighted average interest rate of 3.1%, undrawn revolving letters of credit of US$15.2 million, and US$280.3 million in revolving loans available to be drawn.
 
On 6 October 1999, Constellation, certain of its principal operating subsidiaries, and a syndicate of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The Chase Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent, entered into the existing senior credit facility (as subsequently amended, the "2000 Credit Agreement"). The 2000 Credit Agreement includes both U.S. dollar and British pound sterling commitments of the Syndicate Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of US$1.0 billion (subject to increase as therein provided to US$1.2 billion). Borrowings under the 2000 Credit Agreement have been used to fund permitted acquisitions and ongoing working capital needs of Constellation and its subsidiaries.
 
The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a US$380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility due in December 2004, a US$320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility available for borrowing in British pound sterling due in December 2004, and a US$300.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including letters of credit up to a maximum of US$20.0 million) which expires in December 2004. Commencing in Fiscal 2002, the required quarterly repayments of the Tranche I Term Loan facility were revised to US$17.4 million for each quarter in 2002, US$19.6 million for each quarter in 2003, and US$20.0 million for each quarter in 2004. Commencing in Fiscal 2002, the required quarterly repayments of the Tranche II Term Loan facility were revised to 0.4 million (US$0.6 million) for each quarter in 2002, 0.5 million (US$0.7 million) for each quarter in 2003, and 8.5 million (US$12.0 million) for each quarter in 2004 (the foregoing U.S. dollar equivalents are as of 28 February 2002). There are certain mandatory term loan prepayments under these facilities, including those based on sale of assets and issuance of debt and equity, in each case subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The rate of interest payable, at Constellation's option, is a function of the London interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon Constellation's debt ratio (as defined in the 2000 Credit Agreement, the "Debt Ratio") and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans. As of 28 February 2002, the margin was 1.125% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.625% for Term Loans. In addition to interest, Constellation pays a facility fee on the Revolving Credit commitments at 0.50% per annum as of 28 February 2002. This fee is based upon Constellation's quarterly Debt Ratio and can range from 0.25% to 0.50%.
 
Certain of Constellation's principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed Constellation's obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement. The 2000 Credit Agreement is secured by (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital stock of Canandaigua Limited and all of Constellation's domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the capital stock of Matthew Clark and certain other foreign subsidiaries.
 
Constellation and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness, the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charge ratio and an interest coverage ratio. Among the most restrictive covenants contained in the 2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio.
 
New Senior Credit Facility
 
On 16 January 2003 Constellation, the U.S. subsidiaries of Constellation (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries) and Canandaigua Limited ("Guarantors"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as the "Lenders") entered into a new credit agreement ("2003 Credit Agreement") providing for aggregate credit facilities of US$1.6 billion ("Credit Facilities") consisting of a US$400.0 million Tranche A term loan facility due in December, 2008, a US$800.0
million Tranche B term loan facility due in December, 2009 and a US$400.0 million revolving credit facility (including an Australian Dollar revolving sub-facility of up to A$10.0 million and a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to US$40.0 million) which expires on the fifth anniversary of the first date on which the Lenders' obligation to make loans under the 2003 Credit Agreement commences. The rate of interest under the 2003 Credit Agreement is a function (at Constellation's option) of LIBOR plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin.
 
The obligations of Constellation under the 2003 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Guarantors and will be secured by (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital stock of all of Constellation's US subsidiaries and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the voting capital stock of Canandaigua Limited, Matthew Clark plc, Constellation Australia and certain other foreign subsidiaries of Constellation. Effective on the Implementation Date, a first priority pledge of 65% of the voting capital stock of BRL Hardy will be granted to further secure the obligations under the 2003 Credit Agreement. In addition, under certain circumstances Constellation and the Guarantors will be required to pledge certain of their assets consisting of, among other things, inventory, accounts receivable and trademarks to secure the obligations under the 2003 Credit Agreement.
 
Under the 2003 Credit Agreement, Constellation and the Guarantors make certain representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders customarily found in credit agreements of this type. Also, Constellation and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those restricting additional liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
 
The representations, warranties and covenants in the 2003 Credit Agreement are generally applicable to BRL Hardy and its subsidiaries on and after the Second Court Date. However, during the sixty (60) day period following the date on which the Credit Agreement Funding Conditions (as defined in Section 7.7 below) have been satisfied no default under the 2003 Credit Agreement will result from the failure of BRL Hardy or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any such covenants or the inaccuracy of any representation and warranty with respect to BRL Hardy and its subsidiaries.
 
Constellation intends to use the Tranche A term loan, the Tranche B term loan and a portion of the revolving credit facility under the 2003 Credit Agreement to refinance its obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement, to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the Cash Consideration to Scheme Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme, and to fund the Option Cancellation Loan and to pay certain indebtedness (approximately $558.2 million as at 15 January 2003) outstanding under certain of BRL Hardy's credit facilities ("BRL Hardy Debt") on the closing date. Constellation intends to use the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility under the 2003 Credit Agreement to fund its working capital needs on an ongoing basis.
 
Further information regarding the 2003 Credit Agreement is set out in section 7.7(a).
 
Bridging Facility
 
On 16 January 2003 Constellation, the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, as a lender and administrative agent, and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge loan agreement (the "Bridge Agreement") containing commitments of the Bridge Lenders to make bridge loans ("Bridge Loans") of up to, in the aggregate, US$450.0 million ("Bridging Facility"). The Bridge Loans are due on the first anniversary of the date of the funding of the Bridge Loans ("Bridge Loan Maturity Date"). The rate of interest payable on the Bridge Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin.
 
If the Bridge Loans are not repaid on the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, the Bridge Lenders have committed to make certain term loans in an amount corresponding to the then-outstanding amount of the Bridge Loans ("Term Loans"). The Term Loans are due on the seventh anniversary of the date on which the Bridge Loans are funded ("Term Loan Maturity Date"). The rate of interest payable on the Term Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin. If the Term Loans are not repaid on the date that is three months after the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, then the margin will increase on a quarterly basis thereafter until the Term Loans are refinanced, exchanged or otherwise repaid in full. The rate of interest payable on any of the Bridge Loans or the Term Loans is capped at certain rate ("Rate Cap").
 
The Lenders have the right to exchange on or after the Bridge Loan Maturity Date all or a portion of their respective Bridge Loans or Term Loans for notes ("Exchange Notes") that will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be entered into among Constellation, as issuer, certain Subsidiaries of Constellation, as guarantors, and an indenture trustee on behalf of the holders of the Exchange Notes. The Exchange Note indenture will be in a form to be agreed between Constellation and the Administrative Agent and will contain terms and a final maturity date that are substantially consistent with the terms and the maturity date of the Term Loans. The Exchange Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate as determined by the exchanging holder that will not exceed the Rate Cap.
 
The Guarantors will guarantee Constellation's obligations under the Bridge Agreement.
 
Constellation and the Guarantors make certain representations and warranties in the Bridge Agreement which are substantially the same as the
representations and warranties in the 2003 Credit Agreement. The Bridge Agreement also contains covenants and events of default that are similar to the covenants and events of default in the indentures pursuant to which Constellation issued its Senior Notes (as defined below).
 
The representations, warranties and covenants in the Bridge Agreement are generally applicable to BRL Hardy and its subsidiaries on and after the Second Court Date. However, during the sixty (60) day period following the date on which the Credit Agreement Funding Conditions (as defined in Section 7.7 below) have been satisfied, no default under the Bridge Agreement will result from the failure of BRL Hardy or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any such covenants or the inaccuracy of any representation and warranty with respect to BRL Hardy and its subsidiaries.
 
Constellation intends to use the Bridge Loans to the extent necessary to fund the balance of the cash required to pay the Cash Consideration to Scheme Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme and to fund the Option Cancellation Loan. Constellation plans to repay any Bridge Loans on or before the Bridge Loan Maturity Date with the proceeds of an offering of equity or debt securities or a combination thereof. In respect of this, Constellation has agreed to file a registration statement under the Securities Act (and/or to provide a prospectus that may be used under an effective registration statement) for the purpose of conducting an offer of debt or equity securities to refinance in full the outstanding Bridge Loans.

(e)     Equity Offerings
 
During March 2001, Constellation completed a public offering of 8,740,000 Constellation Shares, which was held as treasury stock. This resulted in net proceeds to Constellation, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of US$139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets.
 
During October 2001, Constellation sold 645,000 Constellation Shares, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of Constellation Shares by stockholders of Constellation. The net proceeds to Constellation, after deducting underwriting discounts, of US$12.1 million were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility.
 
(f)     Capital Expenditures
 
During Fiscal 2002, Constellation incurred US$71.1 million for capital expenditures, including US$10.1 million related to vineyards. Constellation plans to spend approximately US$70.0 million for capital
expenditures, exclusive of vineyards, in fiscal 2003. In addition, Constellation continues to consider the purchase, lease and development of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if opportunities become available. See "Sources and availability of raw materials" in Section 3.3(e) above. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs.
 
(g)    Critical Accounting Policies
 
Constellation's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Constellation's consolidated financial statements. However, certain of Constellation's accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of Constellation's financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by Constellation's management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying those policies, Constellation's management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on Constellation's historical experience, terms of existing contracts, Constellation's observance of trends in the industry, information provided by Constellation's customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Constellation's critical accounting policies include:
 
Inventory valuation.
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. Reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand. Constellation evaluates the adequacy of these reserves quarterly.
 
Accounting for acquisitions.
 
Acquisition activities are an important element of Constellation's business strategy. Constellation's acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that may be incurred. The determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires Constellation's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect Constellation's consolidated financial statements.
 
Impairment of long-lived assets.
 
Constellation's long-lived assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets. In assessing the recoverability of Constellation's goodwill and other intangibles, Constellation must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, Constellation may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. On 1 March 2002, Constellation adopted SFAS No. 142 (as defined below) and will be required to analyse its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2003 and then on a periodic basis thereafter. Constellation currently expects to complete the initial impairment review during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Constellation does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial review. However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded. Any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on Constellation's financial condition and results of operations.
 
(h)    Accounting Pronouncements
 
In August 2001, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning 1 March 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements.
 
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Lastly, SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. Constellation is required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for fiscal years beginning 1 March 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 were adopted on 1 March 2002. The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material impact on Constellation's financial statements. The adoption of the remaining provisions will result in a reclassification of the extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 28 February 2002 (US$1.6 million, net of income taxes), to increase selling, general and administrative expenses (US$2.6 million) and to decrease the provision for income taxes (US$1.0 million).
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN No. 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Othersan Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34."  FIN No. 45 addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees.  FIN No. 45 also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee.  Lastly, FIN No. 45 supersedes FASB Interpretation No. 34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5)." The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.  The Company is required to adopt the disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 for the fiscal year ended 28 February 2003.
 
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF No. 00-21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables."  EITF No. 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.  EITF No. 00-21 also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement.  The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 00-21 for all revenue arrangements entered into beginning 1 August 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of EITF No. 00-21 on its financial statements.
 
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure."  SFAS No. 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation.  Lastly, SFAS No. 148 amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28 ("APB Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.  The Company is required to adopt the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 for the fiscal year ended 28 February 2003.  The Company is required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning 1 March 2003.
 
(i)
                                   
Related Parties
 
Agustin Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fine Wine segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various family owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions with the Fine Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended 28 February 2002. The Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the exclusive distributor of its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell grapes to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long-term contracts; participate as partners with the Fine Wine segment in the ownership and operation of a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and other consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally to the Fine Wine segment and Constellation. Total payments to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totalled US$4.8 million, US$5.0 million, and US$3.2 million for the years ended 28 February 2002, 28 February 2001 and 29 February 2000, respectively. In addition, the Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus Interests. Total fees received from the Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for these services totalled US$0.4 million, US$0.6 million, and US$0.6 million for the years ended 28 February 2002, 28 February 2001 and 29 February 2000, respectively. As of 28 February 2002 and 2001, the net amounts due to/from the Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant.
 
(j)     Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
 
Constellation's results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices, including rising energy and tequila costs. Constellation has been able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. There can be no assurances, however, that Constellation will continue to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.
 
(k)    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
 
Constellation is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, Constellation periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Constellation has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. Constellation uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks.
 
The fair value of long-term debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of long-term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The estimated fair value of Constellation's total long-term debt, including current maturities, was US$1,407.4 million at 28 February 2002.
A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at 28 February 2002, would result in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long-term debt by US$57.6 million. Also, a hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at 28 February 2002, would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows:
 
 
Constellation has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long-term debt. At 28 February 2002, Constellation had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding.
 
Constellation has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada. For Constellation's operations in the United Kingdom, Constellation uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At 28 February 2002, management believes that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash flow. Constellation also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these contracts, Constellation periodically enters into foreign exchange hedging agreements. At 28 February 2002, the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material.
 
Information concerning Constellation's market risks at and for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 does not differ materially from that above.

(d)     Beneficial Owners of More than 5% of Constellation Shares
 
As of 31 January 2003, the following tables and notes set forth (i) the persons known to Constellation to beneficially own more than 5% of Constellation Shares or Constellation B Shares, (ii) the number of shares beneficially owned by them, and (iii) the percent of such class so owned, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent. This information is based on information furnished to Constellation by or on behalf of each person concerned. Unless otherwise noted, the percentages of ownership were calculated on the basis of 78,583,491 Constellation Shares and 12,077,090 Constellation B Shares outstanding as of the close of business on 31 January 2003.
 
See Section 7.6 for a discussion of the Sands family's control of Constellation.
 
 
Beneficial ownership is based on rules of the U.S. SEC and includes shares as to which a person has sole or shared voting or dispositive power. Accordingly, due to shared voting or dispositive power, certain shares are reflected in the table as beneficially owned by more than one person. In addition, pursuant to such rules, the number of shares and the percentage of ownership set forth in the Constellation Shares table includes the number of Constellation Shares that can be purchased by exercising stock options that are exercisable on 31 January 2003 or become exercisable within 60 days thereafter. Such number does not include the number of option shares that may become exercisable within sixty (60) days of 31 January 2003 due to certain acceleration provisions in certain awards, which accelerations cannot be foreseen as of the date of this Scheme Booklet. Such number also does not include Constellation Shares issuable pursuant to the conversion feature of Constellation B Shares beneficially owned by each person. Certain of the persons identified in the table disclaim beneficial ownership of certain shares held by others but as to which the rules of the U.S. SEC deem such persons to have beneficial ownership for reporting purposes.

This Group as reported is composed of Richard Sands, Robert Sands, CWC Partnership-I ("CWCP-I"), another Sands family partnership and the trust for the benefit of the Grandchildren of Marvin and Marilyn Sands (the "Trust").  The basis for the Group consists of: (i) a Stockholders Agreement among Richard Sands, Robert Sands and CWCP-I and (ii) the fact that the familial relationship between Richard Sands and Robert Sands, their actions in working together in the conduct of the business of Constellation and their capacity as partners and trustees of the other members of the Group may be deemed to constitute an agreement to "act in concert" with respect to Constellation's shares. The members of the Group disclaim that an agreement to act in concert exists.  Except with respect to the shares subject to the Stockholders Agreement and the shares owned by CWCP-I, the family partnership and the Trust, no member of the Group is required to consult with any other member of the Group with respect to the voting or disposition of any shares of Constellation.

Directors and Executive Officers
 
(a)     Members of Constellation's Board of Directors

Constellation
Australia Pty Limited
 
Constellation Australia is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation. Constellation Australia was established to acquire BRL Hardy.
Information about BRL Hardy
 
 
Section
4
BRL Hardy is Australia's largest wine producer and one of the top 10 wine companies in the world.
 
The business was formed in 1992 by the merger of respected Australian wine companies, Berri Renmano Limited and Thomas Hardy & Sons.  BRL Hardy was listed on the ASX that year following a public float of shares at $1 per share.
 
Since listing on the ASX, BRL Hardy has provided a compound annual growth in shareholder return of over 20%.
 
The BRL Hardy group has interests in wineries and vineyards in most of Australia's major wine regions as well as New Zealand, France and the United States. Key brands include Banrock Station, Hardys and a large portfolio of regional super and ultra premium wine brands spread across the major wine producing regions of Australia, New Zealand and the US.
 
In Australia, BRL Hardy has a market share of around 24% by volume, covering all price points across bottled table wine, casks, fortified and sparkling wines.  Well known BRL Hardy wine brands in Australia and overseas include Banrock Station, Hardys Nottage Hill, Hardys Stamp and VR, Eileen Hardy, Sir James, Omni, Leasingham, Houghton, Moondah Brook, Yarra Burn, Brookland Valley, Stonehaven, Tintara, Reynell, Bay of Fires, Kamberra, Stanley, Berri and Renmano.
 
BRL Hardy's most prominent market internationally is the United Kingdom where the Hardy brand is the top selling wine brand in the off premise market. Banrock Station is also among the top five selling wines in the UK off premise market.
 
BRL Hardy has a joint venture in the US with Constellation, Pacific Wine Partners.  Pacific Wine Partners owns the successful US brands Blackstone and Farallon and imports and distributes BRL Hardy's Australian, New Zealand and French brands.
 
New Zealand is a significant area of operations for BRL Hardy, which owns Nobilo Wines, New Zealand's second largest wine company. The BRL Group's key New Zealand brands include Nobilo, Selak and Drylands.
 
The report of the Independent Expert contained in section 19 of this Scheme Booklet contains further information about BRL Hardy.
Information about the Merged Group
 
 
Section

5.1         
Overview
 
While the addition of BRL Hardy will significantly enhance Constellation's wine business, Constellation remains committed to its balanced approach across all three major beverage alcohol categories, beer, wine and spirits.  BRL Hardy will add approximately 20% to Constellation's consolidated net sales and operating profit.
 
Constellation will benefit from the bringing together of two complementary businesses that share a common growth orientation and operating philosophies (for a more detailed description of Constellation's operations, refer to Section 3).
 
Similar to past acquisitions made by Constellation, this transaction achieves several strategic objectives. In particular it:
 
       Is expected to improve long-term growth trends
 - 
 
       Increases product depth and geographic reach
 - 
 
       Enhances scale, industry strength and competitiveness
 - 
 
(a)     Improves Long Term Growth Trends
 
Constellation focuses on revenue growth by identifying growing sectors within the beverage alcohol industry.  Constellation currently has three operating segments it considers significant contributors to revenue growth: Imported beer and fine wines in the U.S. and wholesaling in the U.K. The addition of BRL Hardy will add a fourth significant contributor to revenue growth, Australian and New Zealand wines.
 
Australian wines have achieved outstanding export growth over the last decade and industry forecasters expect continued growth over the next 10 years in export markets.  Australian wines offer tremendous quality for the price points in which they compete, driven by high-quality viticulture and wine making techniques.
 
The combination of Constellation and BRL Hardy will provide a balanced portfolio of outstanding New World wines.  The complementary wine portfolios have the potential to enhance the combined company's revenue and profit growth in the U.K., Europe and other international markets.
 
BRL Hardy has experienced strong U.K. and U.S. growth:
 
 
 
With the combined portfolio of New World wines from Australia, California, New Zealand and Chile and expanded routes to market, Constellation will be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the world wine trade.  In particular, the Merger will enhance the ability of Constellation to capture growth in New World wine markets.  The following table indicates some of the identified opportunities and their recent growth in New World wine imports:
(1) Market share of all imports as a percentage of total table wine
 
(2) CAGR = Compound annual growth rate
 
(3) Market share of New World wine imports as a percentage of total table wine
 
Source: International Wine and Spirits Report 2001
 
(b)     Increases Product Depth and Geographic Reach
 
Constellation is already one of the leading beverage alcohol companies across categories and geographies in the world.  In the U.S., it is the largest single-source supplier of beer, wine and spirits with over 100 million cases sold annually. This balanced approach reduces Constellation's reliance on any single category or geography performance and allows Constellation to allocate resources to the faster growing segments within the industry.
 
The BRL Hardy wine portfolio will bring Constellation increased product breadth and reach.  The merger will also add new revenue sources with the addition of Australia, New Zealand and other key world markets.  The proportion of Constellation's sales outside of the U.S. will increase from 30% to 40%.
 
(c)     Enhances Scale, Industry Strength and Competitiveness
 
Constellation currently enjoys leading market positions within the beverage alcohol categories in which it competes.  In the United States, Constellation is the third largest importer of beer, led by the number one imported beer brand Corona Extra, the second largest producer and marketer of wine and the third largest producer and marketer of spirits.  In the U.K., Constellation is a leading marketer of wine, a leading independent drinks wholesaler and the second largest producer and marketer of cider.
 
Constellation and BRL Hardy's ability to successfully create value through joint operations has been demonstrated with the recent performance of Pacific Wine Partners. The combination of Constellation and BRL Hardy represents a logical progression of this existing relationship.  The combination of Constellation and BRL Hardy will create the world's largest wine company with approximately $3.0 billion in wine sales, leading positions in key markets and wine sourced from each of the major New World wine producing countries.
 
The merged wine businesses will commence with market leading positions in the United Kingdom (10% market share of the total wine market), Australia (24% market share) and New Zealand (14% market share), while in the United States, Constellation will strengthen its number two position (18% market share).
 
In the U.K., the combined group will hold 8 of the top 20 brands in the off-premise market, including the number three brand, Stowells of Chelsea (a current Constellation brand) and Banrock Station and Hardys (current BRL Hardy brands).
 
The Merger will bring 100% of the Pacific Wine Partners joint venture under the ownership of the Constellation Wines division.  Pacific Wine Partners has been highly successful with Blackstone and the distribution of BRL Hardy's Banrock Station.  Blackstone is the number three brand in the US market retailing for more than US$11 per 750ml bottle and is the highest growth product in that same category, whilst Banrock Station has achieved excellent sales growth since the formation of Pacific Wine Partners.
 
In the ongoing consolidation of the wine sector, the merger with BRL Hardy is a logical and compelling transaction for Constellation as it delivers the scale to enable participation in future acquisitions and business combination opportunities.
5.2         
Constellation's intentions upon approval of Share Scheme
 
This Section 5 sets out the intentions of Constellation in relation to:
 
corporate matters of BRL Hardy;
 - 
                     
 
the integration of Constellation and BRL Hardy and any major changes to be made to the business of BRL Hardy, including any redeployment of the fixed assets of BRL Hardy; and
 - 
                     
 
the future employment of the present management and employees of BRL Hardy,
 - 
                     
 
on the basis of information concerning BRL Hardy and the circumstances affecting the business of BRL Hardy which are presently known to Constellation.
 
The statements set out in this Section 5 are statements of Constellation's current intention based on limited information, which intentions may vary as circumstances and further information require.
 
Constellation and Constellation Australia have the same intentions concerning the business, assets and employees of BRL Hardy, which are as set out in this Section 5.
 
If the Share Scheme is approved and Constellation comes to own 100% of the issued ordinary shares in BRL Hardy, its intentions are as follows:
 
(a)     Corporate Matters
 
Constellation's current intention, if the Share Scheme is approved, is to:
 
seek to have BRL Hardy removed from the official list of ASX;
(i)
                 
 
appoint nominees of Constellation to the BRL Board.  Constellation nominees have not yet been identified and their identity will depend on the circumstances at the relevant time;
(ii)
              
 
(iii)    commence trading of Constellation stock in the form of Constellation CDIs on the ASX;
 
undertake certain other restructuring of the group entities and assets in order to improve financial efficiency of the Merged Group;
(iv)
          
 
maintain its current policy of not paying dividends and instead to reinvest in the business;
(v)
             
 
compel the acquisition of any outstanding Options pursuant to the Corporations Act in the event that the Option Scheme is not approved; and
(vi)
          
 
compel the acquisition of any outstanding Non-Executive Options in the event that the Resolution is not approved or any offer made to holders of Non-Executive Options pursuant to clause 7 of the Implementation Deed is not accepted.
(vii)
       
 
(b)     Integration of Constellation and BRL Hardy
 
Wine operations
(i)
                 
 
If the Share Scheme is approved, Constellation will become the world's largest wine company with operations in key growth markets including North America, UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
 
The Merger will bring together the strong skill-bases of the two wine companies and, wherever possible, Constellation will apply the key strengths of each entity across the entire group.
 
A separate global wine division, Constellation Wines, will be formed with BRL Hardy's Managing Director, Stephen Millar, assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer, located in Adelaide and reporting to Constellation President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert Sands.
 
The Constellation Wines division will be responsible for formulating and implementing a worldwide wine strategy which supports the individual sales, marketing and production activities of the companies' existing wine businesses.  Constellation intends that initial integration will focus on the United Kingdom operations.
 
Australia
 
BRL Hardy maintains a strong position in the Australian market, as the country's largest wine producer.  If the Share Scheme is approved and implemented, BRL Hardy will also bring to the Merged Group its strong management team and winemaking skills.
 
Constellation intends to maintain the BRL Hardy Australian operations in substantially the same form.  Constellation also envisages future growth plans for the Australian operations to be materially the same as BRL Hardy's current management plans with the possible integration of Constellation's other Australian wine sourcing for export.
 
New Zealand
 
The Nobilo Wine group will become part of the Constellation Wines division.  Constellation intends to maintain the Nobilo Wine group in substantially the same form as at present.
 
United States
 
In the United States, Constellation operates a Popular and Premium business, Fine Wine business and the Pacific Wine Partners 50/50 joint venture with BRL Hardy.
 
The United States wine businesses will become part of the Constellation Wines division and will continue to operate under the direction of the existing management teams. Pacific Wine Partners will also form part of the Constellation Wines division under the direction of its existing management team.
United Kingdom and Europe
 
Constellation has an established position in the United Kingdom through its UK Brands and Wholesale operation, based in Bristol, England.  Constellation intends to integrate the BRL Hardy wine organisation in the UK with its existing UK wine operations.  The combination will create the largest wine group in the UK. Additionally, the UK wholesale operations will continue in substantially the same form as present.
 
As a result of some similarities between the two businesses, Constellation and BRL Hardy understand that there will be some areas of functional overlap between the current UK operations of Constellation and BRL Hardy. Therefore, there may be a reduction in the overall staffing requirements necessary to support these operations.
 
BRL Hardy's European operations in the Languedoc region of France are expected to be maintained in substantially the same form as present.
 
Imported Beer and Spirits
(ii)
              
 
The Imported Beer and Spirits segment imports and markets a diversified line of beer and produces, bottles, imports and markets a diverse line of distilled spirits.  Constellation intends to maintain these operations under their current management and organisational structures throughout North America and the rest of the world.
 
Corporate head office
(iii)
           
 
Constellation's head office functions will remain in Fairport, New York.  The Constellation Wines division will maintain a base in Adelaide, South Australia.  Constellation expects that certain head office functions will no longer be undertaken by BRL Hardy as a result of its delisting and termination of its direct external reporting requirements.
 
(iv)    Systems
 
Constellation and BRL Hardy will over time integrate information technology and accounting systems to ensure business efficiencies are achieved.  Constellation is currently in the process of deploying an integrated and upgraded system for the Constellation Group, and intends to expand this roll-out to encompass BRL Hardy.
 
(c)     Management and Employees
 
Constellation will review the combined businesses, assets and operations of Constellation and BRL Hardy.  As part of this process, Constellation will consider the overall requirement for the staffing of the group, having regard to the proposed organisational structure discussed in (b)(i)-(iii).
 
In order to ensure continuity and minimize interruption to the business during the review process discussed above, Constellation intends to maintain existing management groups and key personnel wherever possible.
 
From Constellation's preliminary review of the BRL Hardy and Constellation operations, and based on the limited information which has presently been made available, Constellation estimates that there are some selective areas of overlap between the two companies' operations.  However, it is not currently possible to quantify the precise impact and Constellation will only be in a position to do so after the acquisition has been completed.
 
Should there be headcount reductions, Constellation will recognize the terms of relevant employment contracts and severance arrangements in force at the time the Share Scheme is completed.  Where possible, reassignment of staff and natural attrition will be used to manage the impact of a lower staff requirement.
 
5.3         
Other Intentions
 
Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, it is the present intention of Constellation:
 
to continue to operate the business of BRL Hardy;
(a)
              
 
not to make any major changes to the business of BRL Hardy, nor to redeploy any of the fixed assets of BRL Hardy; and
(b)
             
 
to continue the employment of the present employees of BRL Hardy.
(c)
              
 
5.4         
Synergies from the Combined Groups
 
The Merged Group will benefit from both Constellation's and BRL Hardy's existing beverage alcohol operations and leading market positions.  The North American market has exhibited strong overall growth in consumption of wine, especially from the consumption of domestically produced products and the growth of Australian wines.
 
The United Kingdom is one of the key markets for New World wines, and the combined group is expected to have a leading position through production and supply of North American and Australian wines.  With integrated marketing and distribution, Constellation expects to be able to drive revenue synergies by selling the groups' products across a broader platform.
 
Constellation expects to generate synergies from the merger in the following areas:
 
Sales growth and higher margins as a result of driving the stronger and broader portfolio into key markets for wine imports.
 - 
                      
 
Global procurement of supplies, in particular the sourcing of grapes and product packaging.
 - 
                      
 
The replacement of wine previously procured from other parties with wines produced by the combined wine business.
 - 
                      
Some reduction in corporate and administrative costs, particularly the delisting from ASX (due to the decreased cost of Constellation maintaining a foreign exempt listing on the ASX) and the consolidation of general administrative functions.
 - 
                                         
 
Some areas of functional overlap between the current UK operations of Constellation and BRL Hardy.
 - 
                                         
 
Cost synergies are expected to reach US$20 million
 
5.5
                              
Financial Position
 
At closing, assuming that BRL Shareholders choose to take the maximum of 15,000,000 Constellation Shares, the proforma net debt to EBITDA ratio for the latest 12 months will be approximately 4.1 times and the pro forma EBITDA to interest coverage ratio for the latest 12 months will be approximately 3.7 times.
 
In the event that no BRL Shareholders elected to receive Scrip Consideration under the Merger, Constellation would be able to fund the total cash payments to BRL Shareholders from existing cash resources and new credit facilities.  This is set out in more detail within section 7.7(a).
 
If no BRL Shareholders elected Scrip Consideration, Constellation expects that it will be within the financial covenants of the 2003 Credit Agreement and Bridge Agreement on completion of the Merger.  In addition, Constellation anticipates that, based on its current expectations of future earnings and cash flows, its position with respect to these financial covenants will strengthen over time as a result of Constellation's strong cash flow generation.
 
Constellation also expects to generate financial benefits in:
 
Increased equity market liquidity due to the greater market capitalisation of the Constellation Group.
 - 
                      
 
The generation of a higher level of cash for use in corporate financing and investing activities.
 - 
                      
 
Generation of additional earnings per share by leveraging the performance of BRL Hardy's business through the combined group.
 - 
                      
 
5.6
                              
Outlook
 
From time to time, Constellation provides earnings guidance based on management's current expectations of future results.  Constellation's latest earnings guidance was released January 16, 2003 for Constellation's fiscal year ending February 28, 2003 ("Fiscal 2003"), fiscal year ending February 28, 2004 ("Fiscal 2004") and the effects of the transaction on Fiscal 2004.  These statements are forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
 
Constellation's diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2003 are expected to be within a range of US$2.03 to US$2.05.
 - 
                      
 
Constellation's diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 are expected to be within a range of US$2.29 to US$2.35, excluding the impact of the BRL Hardy acquisition.
 - 
                      
 
The BRL Hardy acquisition is expected to add US$0.10 to earnings per share for Constellation's Fiscal year 2004, before one-time transaction related expenses and after synergies.
 -

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Data
 
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial data has been prepared to assist you in your analysis of the financial effects of the acquisition of BRL Hardy. This information was derived for each of the respective companies as follows:
 
Constellation's information was derived from its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002 which were filed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 30 November 2002.   These financial statements were subject to a review in accordance with SAS 71.  The Statement of Income for the twelve month period ended 28 February 2002 was derived from Constellation's audited consolidated financial statements filed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 28 February 2002. Constellation's historical information was prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in United States Dollars (US$).

BRL Hardy's information was derived from its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002. These financial statements were subject to a review in accordance with SAS 71. The Statement of Income for the twelve month period ended 28 February 2002 was derived from BRL Hardy's audited consolidated financial statements for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2001. BRL Hardy's historical information was prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in Australia, which differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP.  These differences as they relate to BRL Hardy have been quantified and included in the unaudited pro forma combined financial data.
 - 
                      
 
As a result of the combination of Constellation and BRL Hardy, financial data for Pacific Wine Partners ("PWP"), a 100% owned subsidiary of the combined company, has been consolidated in the unaudited pro forma combined financial data of Constellation for all periods presented. PWP's information was derived from its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002. The Statement of Income for the twelve month period ended 28 February 2002 was derived from PWP's unaudited consolidated financial statements for the period from inception (31 July 2001) to 28 February 2002. PWP's historical information was prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and in US$.
 - 
                      
 
The US$/A$ exchange rate used to convert information as of 30 November 2002 was $0.5610.  The average US$/A$ exchange rates used to convert information for the twelve month period ended 31 December 2001 and for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002 were $0.5178 and $0.5482, respectively.
 - 
                      
 
The information prepared is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the annual reports and other information that Constellation and BRL Hardy have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Australian Stock Exchange Limited, respectively.
 
Several factors should be considered when comparing the historical financial information of Constellation, BRL Hardy and PWP to the unaudited pro forma combined financial data, including the following:
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet gives effect to the transaction as if it had occurred on 30 November 2002.  The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002 and twelve month period ended 28 February 2002 give effect to the transaction as if it had occurred on 1 March 2001.
 - 
                      
 
Certain BRL Hardy amounts have been reclassified in conformity with the financial statement presentation of Constellation.  Amounts reclassified on the BRL Hardy balance sheet include, but are not limited to, noncurrent inventories, grape vines, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities.  Amounts reclassified on the BRL Hardy statements of income include, but are not limited to, excise taxes, certain promotion expenses in accordance with EITF 01-09 and distribution expenses.
 - 
                      
 
Expected annual savings resulting from operating synergies have not been reflected as adjustments to the historical data.
 - 
                      
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial data of Constellation has been presented assuming the election by BRL Hardy shareholders to receive the maximum Scrip Consideration of 15,000,000 shares using an assumed scrip consideration amount of US$25.00 per share.
 - 
                      
 
The unaudited pro forma combined financial data is for illustrative purposes only.  If the transaction had occurred in the past, the combined company's financial position and operating results would likely have been different from that presented in the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Income.  Due to the nature of pro forma information, it may not give a true picture of the combined company's financial position and results of operations.  Constellation believes that the unaudited pro forma combined financial data may not be indicative of the future financial performance of the combined companies.
 
In addition, the purchase price allocation is based upon management's preliminary estimate of fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amounts may differ significantly based upon the results of an independent appraisal.  The unaudited pro forma combined financial data should not be relied on as an indication of the financial position or operating results that the combined company would have achieved if the transaction had occurred in the past.  The unaudited pro forma combined financial data should also not be relied on as an indication of future results that Constellation will achieve after the transaction.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information as at 30 November 2002, for the Nine Months Ended 30 November 2002 and for the Twelve Months Ended 28 February 2002
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Financial Information as at 30 November 2002, for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 and for the twelve months ended 28 February 2002 have been presented assuming the election by BRL Hardy shareholders to receive the maximum Scrip Consideration of 15,000,000 shares.
 
For comparative purposes, assuming an all Cash Consideration, debt as at 30 November 2002 would have been higher by US$375.0 million and the net debt to equity ratio (total interest bearing debt, net of cash and cash investments, divided by stockholders' equity) would have been 2.48 versus 1.60 in a maximum Scrip Consideration. For the nine months ended 30 November 2002, income from continuing operations would have been lower by US$10.9 million to US$169.5 million, and diluted earnings per share would have been increased by US$0.15 to US$1.83 per share.  For the twelve months ended 28 February 2002, income from continuing operations would have been lower by US$19.4 million to US$94.6 million, and diluted earnings per share would have been decreased by US$0.03 to US$1.08 per share.
 
Constellation's historical statement of income for the twelve months ended 28 February 2002 has been reclassified to comply with the guidance of EITF 01-09.  This reclassification will be required to be presented in Constellation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 28 February 2003. The effect of the reclassification decreased net sales by US$213.7 million, increased cost of product sold by US$10.1 million and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by US$223.8 million.
 
The consolidated financial statements of BRL Hardy for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002 were derived by reducing the two month period ended 28 February 2002 from BRL Hardy's eleven month period ended 30 November 2002. The two month period ended 28 February 2002 is not included in BRL Hardy's twelve month period ended 31 December 2001. Net sales and net income for the excluded two month period are US$41.7 million and US$9.0 million, respectively.
 
For the twelve months ended 28 February 2002, Pacific Wine Partner's statement of income represents results of operations from date of formation (31 July 2001) to 28 February 2002.
 
US GAAP Adjustments
 
BRL Hardy prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Australia ("A GAAP").  A GAAP differs in certain material respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), as they relate to BRL Hardy.
 
These differences and the effect of the adjustments necessary to present BRL Hardy's consolidated stockholders' equity and income from continuing operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP as at 30 November 2002, for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 and for the twelve months ended 31 December 2001 are detailed below.
 
(a) Superannuation
 
The company recognizes defined benefit superannuation expense on an accrual basis in accordance with actuarial recommendations.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS 87 "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" requires superannuation expense to be recognized on an accrual basis over the service period of the employees. Superannuation expense is determined using actuarial assumptions and includes service costs, interest costs and expected return on plan assets.  The difference between the cumulative expense recognized in prior periods and the contributions made by BRL Hardy is reflected as either a prepaid asset or liability in the balance sheet.
 
The pro formas include adjustments to reflect the prepaid pension asset and to recognize pension benefits in earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP, offset by the reversal of the pension expense of $3.5 million and $1.9 million recorded under A GAAP for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 and the twelve months ended 31 December 2001, respectively.
 
(b) Stock compensation
 
BRL Hardy grants options to employees, executive directors and employees of associates under the BRL Hardy Option Plan.  The options vest upon grant and are exercisable three years after grant if the weighted average market price of an ordinary share increases by 10% over the exercise price of the option.  In 2001 BRL Hardy granted ordinary shareholders and option holders renounceable rights on a one for ten basis to purchase additional shares at $9.30 per new share.  The rights granted to the option holders become exercisable if the preconditions for the exercise of the related options have been met.
 
Under A GAAP, no compensation costs are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for shares granted to employees.
 
BRL Hardy has elected to account for the plan in accordance with APB 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25) for U.S. GAAP purposes.  Under APB 25, options granted under the plan are considered variable until the weighted average market price increases by 10% over the exercise price, at which time the compensation element becomes fixed.  For variable plans, compensation expense is recognized as the difference between the market price of an ordinary share and the exercise price of the option over the vesting period.  Under U.S. GAAP, compensation expense is also recognized for the renounceable rights granted to employees, in a similar manner to that described above.  The pro formas include adjustments to recognize compensation cost under U.S. GAAP.
(c)  Insurance receivable
 
by a third party vendor.  Under A GAAP, a receivable is recorded when recovery is considered more likely then less likely to be received.  Under U.S. GAAP, an insurance receivable is recorded for losses recognized in the statement of financial performance only when realization of the claim is deemed likely to be received.  Insurance receivables for losses not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements are recognized when received.  The pro formas include adjustments to reverse the receivables and income recognized under A GAAP.
BRL Hardy recognized an insurance receivable for loss of inventory and related costs resulting from faulty taps provided
 
(d) Capitalization of borrowing costs to inventory
 
BRL Hardy capitalizes interest costs to wine stocks that take greater than twelve months to be prepared for sale in accordance with the requirements of AASB 1036 "Borrowing Costs".
 
Under U.S. GAAP, interest costs are not capitalized to inventory unless the inventory is constructed or produced as a discrete project for which costs are separately accumulated and where construction of the asset takes considerable time and entails substantial expenditures.  The preparation and aging process for wine stocks does not meet these criteria. The pro formas include adjustments to remove the amount of interest capitalized to inventory and to reverse the net impact on profits.
 
(e) Grape vines and inventory
 
Effective 1 January 2000, BRL Hardy changed its accounting policy for grape vines from historical cost to net market value in accordance with AASB 1037 "Self-Generating and Regenerating Assets".  Any change in market value is recognized in the statement of financial performance.  At harvest the fruit is transferred to inventory at net market value.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, grape vines and inventory are recorded at acquisition or production cost.  The pro formas include adjustments to reverse the cumulative effect of the adoption of AASB 1037; to restore the historical carrying value of the assets; to reverse the mark-to-market impacts on earnings; and to include depreciation of the grape vines.
 
(f)  Goodwill amortization
 
Under A GAAP, goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time during which benefits are expected to arise but no longer than twenty years.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, BRL Hardy would have been required to cease amortizing goodwill effective 1 January 2002 as goodwill is no longer amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".  The pro formas include adjustments to reverse the amortisation expense recognized under A GAAP.
 
(g)  Revenue recognition
 
BRL Hardy recognizes revenue for domestic sales upon dispatch to the customer.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, SAB 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," revenue cannot be recognized until legal title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.  Accordingly, the pro formas include adjustments to reverse the revenue recognized under A GAAP; to reverse the corresponding trade debtors; to restore inventory; and to reverse the cost of sales.
 
In the normal course of business BRL Hardy provides customers with volume and quantity discounts, retail display allowances and cooperative advertising allowances.  The costs of these programmes are recognized in selling, distribution and marketing expenses in the statement of financial performance.
 
Under U.S. GAAP and in accordance with EITF 01-09 "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)" these expenditures have been reclassified as a reduction in revenue.  In applying EITF 01-09 BRL Hardy's total revenues for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 and the twelve months ended 31 December 2001 have been reduced by $71.3 million and $56.8 million, respectively, with corresponding decreases to selling, distribution and marketing expenses.  This difference in treatment does not impact income from continuing operations. This reclassification was made in the column headed BRL Hardy A$ A GAAP and has not been separately presented.
 
(h)  Purchase accounting for Nobilo
 
During 2000, BRL Hardy purchased in several stages the remaining 75% interest in Nobilo Wine Group Limited for $4.6 million and 4.1 million BRL Hardy shares.  Under A GAAP, the fair value of the 4.1 million shares issued as purchase consideration was determined at each share exchange date. The costs of the acquisition are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired, including inventory, using the purchase method and measured at their estimated fair values.  A GAAP is not prescriptive in the method used to determine the fair values of individual assets and liabilities acquired.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, the fair value of securities issued for purchase consideration is equal to the market price of the shares a few days before and after the date the terms of the acquisition are agreed to and announced. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.  APB 16 "Business Combinations" provides that the fair value of finished goods inventory is calculated as the estimated selling price less the sum of costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquiring entity.   The fair value of work in process inventory is calculated as the estimated selling price of finished goods less the sum of costs to complete, costs of disposal, and a reasonable profit allowance for the completing and selling effort of the acquiring entity based on profit for similar finished goods.
 
The pro formas include adjustments to reflect the increased purchase cost under U.S. GAAP resulting from the difference in the method used in determining the fair value of the shares issued, the difference in the fair value of the inventory acquired and the recognition of derivative contracts at fair value, net of goodwill amortization.
 
(i) Derivative instruments
 
BRL Hardy enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge the exchange rate risk on foreign currency receivables and payables and on anticipated foreign currency sales and purchases.  Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying physical exposures being hedged.  Foreign currency receivables and payables that are hedged under forward foreign exchange contracts are translated at the end of the
reporting period at the exchange rate fixed in the hedge contract.
 
Gains or losses on foreign currency receivables and payables are recognized currently in earnings.  Gains or losses arising on forward foreign exchange options and contracts intended as hedges of anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized when the underlying transactions occur.
 
BRL Hardy enters into interest rate contracts, swaps and options to hedge against movements in interest rates and to minimize the volatility of BRL Hardy's profit and net cash flows arising from changes in interest rates. The terms of the interest rate contracts are intended to match the maturity profile of the underlying debt.
 
The cash flows required under interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis and either recognized in the statement of financial performance as interest expense as they occur or included in the carrying amount of assets through capitalization of borrowing costs.
 
Effective 1 January 2001, BRL Hardy applied SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. SFAS 133 requires derivatives to be recorded at their fair value as either an asset or liability in the statement of financial position.  Gains or losses on derivatives which qualify and are effective as cash flow hedges are accumulated in equity as other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs.  Gains or losses on non-qualifying derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.  Gains or losses on fair value hedges and on the underlying item being hedged are also recorded in earnings.  Although SFAS 133 permits hedge accounting for hedges of forecasted transactions, BRL Hardy has not met the restrictive documentation, designation and effectiveness assessments required under SFAS 133. As a result, the derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted transactions are marked to market through earnings.
 
BRL Hardy did not meet the restrictive documentation, designation and effectiveness assessments required under SFAS 133 for its interest rate contracts.  As a result, upon adoption of SFAS 133, a transition adjustment equal to the fair value of the interest rate contracts was recorded in stockholders' equity.  Subsequent movements in the fair value of the interest rate contracts are recognized in earnings.  The transition adjustment is reclassified from stockholders' equity to earnings over the life of the contracts existing at transition.
 
During June 2002, BRL Hardy entered into a foreign currency derivative to hedge its investment in a foreign subsidiary. At the inception of the hedge, BRL Hardy did not meet the restrictive designation and effectiveness requirements of SFAS 133.  The pro formas include adjustments to recognize the derivative instrument at fair value and to reverse the amounts recognized in currency translation reserve and earnings under A GAAP.
 
The application of U.S. GAAP results in the recording on the balance sheet of additional liabilities of $39.1 million and additional receivables of $6.4 million as at 30 November 2002.
 
(j) Investment in GSI Holdings
 
BRL Hardy has recorded its investment in 100% of the preference shares in GSI Holdings at historical cost. Dividend income is recognized when declared.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, the assets and liabilities of GSI Holdings would be consolidated as the ordinary shareholder has not made a substantive capital investment and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by BRL Hardy.  In addition, as at 30 November 2002, GSI Holdings' principal asset, consisting of an approximate 17.9% interest in the International Wine Investment Fund, would be accounted for using the equity method.  As at 30 November 2002, the International Wine Investment Fund held approximately 11.6% of the outstanding ordinary shares of BRL Hardy.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, the cross shareholding would be treated as treasury stock and recorded in shareholders' equity. Corresponding adjustments would also be made to dividends paid and the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  The pro formas include adjustments to record the cross shareholding as treasury stock; to account for the interest in the International Wine Investment Fund using the equity method; to reverse the dividend income recognized under A GAAP for dividends received from GSI Holdings; to increase the carrying value of the equity investment in the International Wine Investment Fund for dividends paid on Company shares; and to record the purchase of additional shares by the International Wine Investment Fund as equity transactions.
 
(k)  Deferred income taxes
 
BRL Hardy recognizes deferred income taxes using the liability method of tax-effect accounting, adjusting for permanent differences.  Tax loss carryforwards are recognized when realization is virtually certain.  Certain deferred tax liabilities which do not reverse for many years are discounted and recognized at net present value.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes" requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between book and tax balances and the recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards and credits if realization is more likely than not. Discounting of deferred tax assets or liabilities is not permitted.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for changes in tax rates in the period of enactment.
 
The pro formas include adjustments to reverse the impact of discounting and recognize as temporary differences certain adjustments classified as permanent under A GAAP.
 
In addition, the pro formas include adjustments to reflect the SFAS 109 tax impact of the U.S. GAAP differences.
(l)  Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
 
BRL Hardy periodically revalues land to the directors' valuation based on independent valuers' estimates of fair value.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost.  Revaluations are not permitted. The pro formas include adjustments to remove the effects of the revaluations including the increased value of the assets. There is no impact of the revaluations on depreciation expense and the revaluations have not had an impact on gains or losses from disposal during the periods presented.
 
(m)  Minority interest
 
Under A GAAP, outside interests in controlled entities are recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. Under U.S. GAAP, outside interests in controlled entities are recorded outside of shareholders' equity.
 
(n)  Equipment leases
 
BRL Hardy has entered into certain sale-leaseback transactions with a financial institution beginning in 1998. Under A GAAP, the equipment was removed from the balance sheet and the leasebacks accounted for as operating leases.  No gains or losses were realised on the sales.
 
Under U.S. GAAP, the transactions do not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting because of continuing involvement by the lessee and the arrangement is accounted for as a financing lease.  Accordingly, in reconciling to U.S. GAAP, BRL Hardy would recognize equipment and liabilities of $27.9 million as at 30 November 2002.  The difference in treatment does not result in a material adjustment to profit.
 
Acquisition Adjustments
 
Reflects the estimated purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition based upon Constellation management's preliminary estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conformity with U.S. GAAP requirements. For purchase accounting, BRL Hardy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at Constellation management's estimated fair value. The estimated amounts recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed from BRL Hardy may differ significantly from the final assigned values based upon the results of an independent appraisal at the date of acquisition.
(aa)
                           
 
The U.S. GAAP requirement to allocate the total purchase cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (net assets) based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition results in a US$163.7 million increase in the recorded value of BRL Hardy's net assets. The purchase accounting adjustment of US$163.7 million consists of a decrease in inventory of US$34.2 million, an increase in property, plant and equipment of US$37.1 million, a reversal of acquired goodwill of US$5.2 million, an increase in trademarks of US$238.4 million, and an increase in deferred income taxes of $US72.4 million. The excess of purchase cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired results in goodwill of $US529.3 million. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not written off or amortized; however, it is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
 
The purchase accounting adjustments noted above were calculated in accordance with appropriate U.S. GAAP requirements and accepted appraisal methodologies. Inventory was valued at estimated selling prices of finished goods less the sum of costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance based upon Constellation Management's preliminary expectations of selling prices and costs of disposal fr the inventory on hand at the date of acquisition. Property, plant and equipment was valued at estimated current replacement costs less estimated accumulated depreciation. Trademarks were valued at fair value in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP for the valuation of intangible assets. BRL Hardy owns the trademarks and carries a value on its books for certain acquired trademarks. The purchase accounting adjustment above related to an increase in trademarks which represents the difference between the estimated fair value and BRL Hardy's carrying value of those trademarks. The trademarks which were valued included Banrock Station, Hardys Nottage Hill, Hardys Stamp and VR, Eileen Hardy, Sir James, Omni, Leasingham, Houghton, Moondah Brook, Yarra Burn, Stonehaven, Tintara, Reynell, Bay of Fires, Kamberra, Stanley, Berri and Renmano. Trademarks were valued using a relief-from-royalty methodology which is based on the supposition that a company would be willing to pay a royalty to the owner of an asset to realize the economic benefits from that asset. The relief-from-royalty methodology involves determining the present value of the theoretical royalty savings associated with the ownership of the trademark. The royalty rate was estimated based on the strength of the brand and projected sales of the brand.
 
The calculation of excess purchase cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired (in thousands of US$) is as follows:
 
 
Reflects the liability for direct acquisition costs of US$9.4 million.  Capitalized financing costs of US$0.8 million were funded through the bank credit facility.

Risk Factors
 
 
Section
6
BRL Shareholders may, at their Election, receive Constellation Scrip as all or part of the consideration for their BRL Shares (see Section 1 and the Share Scheme in Section 13). The financial performance and operations of Constellation's business, the value of Constellation Scrip and the amount and timing of any dividends that Constellation pays, will be influenced by a range of factors. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Constellation.
 
risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect Constellation's business or the value of Constellation Scrip. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Constellation or that Constellation currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect Constellation's business and operations or your investment in Constellation Scrip.  If any of the matters included in the following risks were to occur, Constellation's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects, or the value of your Constellation Scrip, could be materially adversely affected.
The
 
6.1
                              
Risks relating to Constellation's business
 
(a)
              
Constellation's indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its financial health
 
Constellation has incurred substantial indebtedness to finance its acquisitions, will incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance the Merger, and may incur further substantial indebtedness in the future to finance other acquisitions or for other purposes.
 
Constellation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations under its indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon Constellation's future operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond Constellation's control. Therefore, there can be no assurance that Constellation's cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure requirements.
 
Constellation's current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. Such consequences include, or may include, the following:
 
Constellation's ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
 - 
                      
 
a significant portion of Constellation's cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available for operations, expansion or distributions;
 - 
                      
 
Constellation is subject to restrictive covenants that could limit its ability to conduct its business; and
 - 
                      
 
Constellation may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and, thus, may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures.
 - 
                      
 
The restrictive covenants included in Constellation's existing and new senior credit facilities, the Bridging Facility and its indentures include, among others, restrictions in relation to additional borrowings, the sale of assets, changes of control, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, the making of investments and certain other fundamental changes. The senior credit facility and the Bridging Facility also contain restrictions on acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests including a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These restrictions could limit Constellation's ability to conduct business. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, the Bridging Facility, its indentures or in follow-on financings could result in an event of default under such agreements, which could require Constellation to immediately repay
the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.
 
(b)
             
The termination or non-renewal of imported beer distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on Constellation's business
 
All of Constellation's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products and are subject to renewal from time to time. Constellation's agreements to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily Western U.S. states expires in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria, continued retention of certain personnel and other terms of the agreement, will be automatically renewed for additional terms of five years. Changes in control of Constellation or its subsidiaries involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of such subsidiaries, may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such changes, to terminate the agreement. The supplier's consent to such changes may not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to their expiration, these agreements may be terminated if Constellation fails to meet certain performance criteria. Constellation believes that it is currently in compliance with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements.
 
From time to time, Constellation has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain performance criteria in Constellation's distribution agreements. It is possible that Constellation's beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or may be terminated prior to expiration.
 
(c)
             
Competition could have a Material Adverse Effect on Constellation's Business
 
Constellation is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of its sales could be negatively affected by its inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of Constellation's wholesale customers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of Constellation's products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived absolute or relative overall value of Constellation's products, including their quality or pricing, compared to competitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, Constellation's products. Constellation could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if Constellation finds it necessary to increase the number of its personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive position or for other reasons.
 
(d)
             
Increase in Excise Taxes and of Governmental Regulations could have a Material Adverse Effect on Constellation's Business
 
In the United States, the federal government and individual states impose excise taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change. In addition, the beverage alcohol products industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal agencies. The U.S. federal alcohol authority and the various state liquor authorities regulate such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labelling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state regulations also require warning labels and signage. In addition, after the Merger, some of Constellation's operations will become further subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the beverage alcohol industry in Australia and other applicable Australian laws and regulations.  In the United Kingdom, Constellation carries on its operations under a Customs and Excise Licence. Licences are required for all premises where wine is produced. Constellation holds a licence to act as an excise warehouse operator and registrations have been secured for the production of cider and bottled water. Increases in excise taxes on beverage alcohol products in the United States or the United Kingdom, if enacted, could materially adversely effect Constellation's financial condition or results of operations. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees and requirements could also have a material adverse effect on Constellation's financial condition or results of operations.
 
(e)
             
Constellation relies on the Performance of Wholesale Distributors for the Success of its Business
 
In the United States, Constellation sells its products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and discount stores and restaurants. The replacement or poor performance of Constellation's major wholesalers or Constellation's inability to collect accounts receivable from Constellation's major wholesalers could materially adversely affect Constellation's results of operations and financial condition. Distribution channels for beverage alcohol products have been characterised in recent years by rapid change, including consolidations of certain wholesalers. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of Constellation's products offer products which compete directly with Constellation's products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that these wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to
products of Constellation's competitors. In the future, Constellation's wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase Constellation's products or provide Constellation's products with adequate levels of promotional support.
 
(f)
               
Constellation's Business could be Adversely Affected by a General Decline in the Consumption of Products Constellation Sells
 
In the United States, notwithstanding the fact that there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in the most recent few years, the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products by adults (ages 21 and over) has declined substantially over the past 20 years. A general decline in consumption could be caused by a variety of factors, including:
 
a general decline in economic conditions;
 - 
                      
 
increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;
 - 
                      
 
a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products;
 - 
                      
 
the increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and
 - 
                      
 
increased federal and state excise taxes.
 - 
                      
 
(g)
            
Constellation generally does not have Long-Term Supply Contracts and Constellation is subject to Substantial Price Fluctuations for Grapes and Grape-Related Materials; Constellation has a Limited Group of Suppliers of Glass Bottles
 
Constellation's business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, and alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. Constellation could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect Constellation's ability to supply goods to its customers. Constellation is also directly affected by increases in the costs of such raw materials. In the past, Constellation has experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although Constellation believes it has adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, Constellation could experience shortages. In addition, one of Constellation's largest components of cost of goods sold is that of glass bottles, which have only a small number of producers. The inability of any of Constellation's glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could adversely affect Constellation's business.
 
(h)
            
Constellation has a Material Amount of Goodwill, and if Constellation is required to Write Down Goodwill Due to Impairment, it would reduce Constellation's Net Income, which in turn could materially adversely affect Constellation's results of operations
 
Approximately US$721.1 million (net of accumulated amortisation), or 21.6%, of Constellation's total assets as of 30 November 2002, represented unamortised goodwill. Goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair market value of the net assets acquired. Constellation was required to record goodwill as an intangible asset on the balance sheet and to amortise it over a period of years. Constellation has historically amortised goodwill on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years.  However, on 20 July 2001, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). SFAS No. 142 became effective for acquisitions occurring on or after 1 July 2001 and was adopted by Constellation on 1 March 2002, for acquisitions that occurred prior to 1 July 2001. SFAS No. 142 results in goodwill no longer being amortised. Instead, goodwill is subject to a periodic impairment evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Reductions in Constellation's net income caused by a write-down of goodwill could materially adversely affect Constellation's results of operations and the trading value of Constellation Scrip.
 
(i)
               
Currency Rate Fluctuations/Cross Border Operations
 
Constellation has operations in several different countries and, therefore, Constellation and the holders of Constellation Scrip are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. Constellation could experience changes in its ability to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in
exchange rates.  Constellation could also be affected by nationalisations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may affect Constellation's results, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of Constellation's suppliers, affect Constellation's global operations.  The Merger will significantly increase Constellation's exposure to currency fluctuations.
 
(j)
               
Constellation's Acquisition or Joint Venture Strategies may not be successful
 
The Merger will be the latest in a series of significant mergers and acquisitions by Constellation in the past five years.  Constellation may also, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that Constellation believes would provide a strategic fit with its business. The operations of acquired or merged businesses will need to be integrated with Constellation's existing operations. There can be no assurance that Constellation will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into its business or product offerings. Acquisitions are accompanied by risks such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Acquisitions are also subject to risks associated with the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption to Constellation's business and the diversion of management time and attention. Constellation may also enter into new joint ventures. There is the risk that any joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or Constellation. There is also risk that Constellation's joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and that Constellation may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Constellation's failure or the failure of an entity in which Constellation has a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on Constellation's financial condition or results of operations.
 
6.2
                              
Risks relating to the Merger and investing in Constellation Scrip
 
(a)
             
Constellation and BRL Hardy may not integrate successfully or within the time period that is currently anticipated
 
Following the acquisition of BRL Hardy, Constellation currently intends, to the extent possible, to integrate its operations and those of BRL Hardy. Constellation's goal in integrating these operations is to increase revenues and earnings and achieve cost savings through synergies as well as consolidation and enhanced growth opportunities.  The combination of Constellation and BRL Hardy would involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently.  As a result, the transaction will present challenges to management, including the integration of the operations, systems, technologies and personnel of Constellation and BRL Hardy, and special risks, including possible unanticipated liabilities, unanticipated costs, diversion of management's attention, operational interruptions and the possible loss of key employees, customers or suppliers.  The fact that BRL Hardy's operations are in a number of different countries may further complicate the integration process.  The difficulties Constellation management encounters in the transition and integration processes could have a material adverse effect on the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of the combined company.
 
Constellation may fail to successfully complete the necessary integration of Constellation and BRL Hardy or realise the anticipated benefits of integration. Actual cost savings and synergies may or may not be achieved and may take more time to be achieved than is presently contemplated.
 
(b)
             
Changes in the value of Constellation Scrip may affect the value of your consideration
 
In addition to cash, BRL Shareholders may, at their Election, receive Scrip Consideration. If BRL Shareholders elect to receive any Scrip Consideration as part of the Share Scheme
Consideration, the specific dollar value of the consideration BRL Shareholders receive will depend upon the market price of Constellation Shares at the time BRL Shareholders receive their consideration. If the market price of Constellation Shares increases or decreases, the market value of the Scrip Consideration BRL Shareholders receive under the Share Scheme will correspondingly increase or decrease. The market value of Constellation Shares at the time at which they are received by BRL Shareholders may vary significantly from their market value on the date of their approval of the Share Scheme or the date on which the Election is required to be received. Many of the factors that affect the market price of Constellation Shares are beyond the control of Constellation. BRL Shareholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Constellation Shares.
 
(
c)
             
Constellation CDIs trading on the ASX may have lower liquidity than BRL Shares currently trading on the ASX and Constellation Shares trading on the NYSE
 
BRL Shareholders who vote in favour of the Share Scheme and elect to receive Scrip Consideration which is paid in the form of Constellation CDIs should be aware that the level of trading activity of Constellation CDIs on the ASX may be less than the historical level of trading activity in BRL Shares on the ASX and less than the level of trading activity in Constellation Shares on the NYSE.  In addition, the trading value on the ASX of the number of Constellation CDIs representing one Constellation Share may be less than or greater than the Australian dollar equivalent of the trading value on the NYSE of a Constellation Share.
 
(d)
             
Volatility of price of Constellation Scrip
 
The price of Constellation Scrip may be volatile due to the factors described in this Section 6 and other factors, some of which are beyond Constellation's control including, but not limited to, operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; changes in expectations as to Constellation's future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors; changes in market valuations of other beverage alcohol companies; announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by Constellation or its competitors; and future issues of Constellation debt or equity securities.  Exchange rate movements may affect the value and/or the price of, and income from, Constellation Scrip. In addition, stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may materially adversely affect the trading price of the Constellation Scrip, regardless of Constellation's actual operating performance.

Nature of securities offered

Information about and rights attaching to Constellation CDIs
 
(a)
             
Constellation CDIs as consideration
 
Constellation CDIs are the form in which Constellation Shares will be able to be traded on the ASX following the applications referred to in Section 11.14.
 
Settlement of trading of quoted securities on the ASX market takes place on CHESS, which is the ASX's electronic transfer and settlement system. CHESS allows for and requires the transfer and settlement of transactions in securities quoted on the ASX to be effected electronically. No share or security certificates are issued in respect of shareholdings or security holdings which are quoted on the ASX and settled on CHESS, nor is it a requirement for transfer forms to be executed in relation to transfers which occur on CHESS.
 
It is not possible for Constellation Shares to be settled electronically in or held in CHESS. However, Constellation CDIs represent a beneficial interest in Constellation Shares which can be traded electronically in CHESS and therefore facilitate trading in Australia on the ASX.
 
Constellation shares issued under the Share Scheme (other than to the U.S. Scheme Shareholders or Foreign Scheme Shareholders) will be issued by Constellation to CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Limited (""), a wholly owned subsidiary of the ASX, to hold as depositary entity. These will be registered in the name of CDN which will hold the legal title to such Constellation Shares on trust for the benefit of such BRL Shareholders.
CDN
 
Constellation intends that the ratio of Constellation Shares to Constellation CDIs be set so that each underlying Constellation Share is represented by 10 Constellation CDIs.  At this ratio, which is subject to the approval of the ASX, 10 Constellation CDIs will be convertible into 1 Constellation Share.
 
(b)
             
Overview of CDIs
 
CDIs are units of beneficial ownership in securities, the legal title to the securities being held by an Australian depositary entity. Where CDIs are issued, CDN will be registered as the legal owner of Constellation Shares holding on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Constellation CDI holders.
 
The main difference between holding CDIs and holding shares is that the holder of CDIs has beneficial ownership of the underlying shares in Constellation instead of legal title.  CDI holders are entitled to all economic benefits of direct share ownership, including the right to receive any dividends, rights and bonus issues.  CDI holders will receive notices of general meetings and are able to attend if they wish.  They will be able to direct the depositary to cast proxy votes in accordance with their directions.  To vote personally, a holder would need to convert their CDIs into the underlying Constellation Shares as described in Section 7.2(d) below.
 
Holders of Constellation CDIs will be able to transfer and settle transactions electronically on the ASX in CHESS.
 
Constellation will operate a stock ledger of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, an uncertificated issuer sponsored subregister of Constellation CDIs and an uncertificated CHESS subregister of Constellation CDIs. The stock ledger will be the register of legal title and the two uncertificated Constellation CDI subregisters combined will make up the register of beneficial title (with the stock ledger reflecting the record ownership by CDN of the Constellation Shares underlying the CDIs recorded in the two uncertificated Constellation CDI subregisters).
 
A Constellation CDI holder will receive a holding statement rather than a share certificate. The holding statement sets out the number of Constellation CDIs issued to (or subsequently transferred to or by) each holder. The holding statement will also advise the holder of the holder reference number of their holding. A holding statement will be provided to holders on a periodic basis if there is a change in their holding of Constellation CDIs.
(c)
             
Trading in Constellation CDIs
 
Following the applications referred to in Section 11.14, Constellation CDIs will trade on the ASX but they will not trade on the NYSE or any other exchange.
 
Constellation Shares trade on the NYSE but will not trade on the ASX.
 
Constellation CDI holders can trade the Constellation Shares represented by their Constellation CDIs on the NYSE by first converting their Constellation CDIs to certificated Constellation Shares (see Section 7.2(d) below). Once the Constellation CDIs have been converted, the holder is able to trade its Constellation Shares on the NYSE.
 
(d)
             
Converting from a Constellation CDI to a certificated Constellation Share
 
Holders of Constellation CDIs may at any time convert their Constellation CDIs (in multiples of 10) to certificated Constellation Shares by contacting Constellation's Australian share registry either:
 
directly in the case of Constellation CDIs on the issuer sponsored sub-register operated by Constellation. Holders will be provided by Constellation's Australian share registry with the applicable request form for completion and return; or
 - 
                      
 
through their Controlling Participant (generally a stock broker) in the case of Constellation CDIs which are sponsored on the CHESS subregister. In this case the Controlling Participant will arrange for completion of the applicable request form.
 - 
                      
 
In both cases, once Constellation's Australian share registry has received the applicable request form, advice will be given to Constellation's tranfer agent for the shares to be registered in accordance with the instructions in the request form.
 
It is expected that this process will take approximately 2 to 3 business days to complete, following the initial conversion request being made, although no guarantee can be given about the time for conversion to take place. No trading of Constellation Shares on the exchanges on which Constellation Shares are listed can take place until the share register entries, referred to above, have been completed.
 
Similarly, Constellation Shares can be transferred to CDN in exchange for the issue of Constellation CDIs.
 
It is likely that the transaction costs for Australian residents associated with trading Constellation Shares on the NYSE will be higher than the transaction costs associated with trading Constellation CDIs on the ASX.
 
(e)
             
Dividends, Rights and Other Shareholder Entitlements
 
Under the SCH Business Rules, Constellation is required to treat holders of Constellation CDIs as if they are holders of the underlying Constellation Shares.
 
The SCH Business Rules require that all economic benefits such as dividends, bonus issues, rights issues or similar corporate actions flow through to CDI holders as if they were the legal owners of the underlying securities.
 
Any cash dividends or distributions made in a currency other than Australian dollars will be converted and paid to Constellation CDI holders, in Australian dollars by Constellation's Australian share registry, as agent for CDN.
 
(f)
               
Attendance at Meetings - Voting Entitlements
 
As holders of Constellation CDIs are not the legal owners of the underlying Constellation Shares, holders of Constellation CDIs are entitled to attend Constellation Shareholder meetings but they are not entitled to vote. Only CDN, which holds legal title to the Constellation Shares underlying the Constellation CDIs, is entitled to vote the Constellation Shares at the instruction of the holder of the Constellation CDIs.
 
Voting rights may only be exercised by a holder of Constellation CDIs by either directing CDN to vote in a particular manner or by converting the CDIs to Constellation Shares.  Persons holding CDIs must convert them into the underlying securities in sufficient time before the record date for the meeting to enable them to vote personally.
 
(g)
            
Takeovers
 
The SCH Business Rules prohibit CDN from accepting a takeover offer in respect of Constellation Shares which it holds on behalf of a holder of Constellation CDIs unless the CDI holder directs CDN to accept the offer.
 
It is CDN's responsibility to ensure that the bidder processes such acceptances from the holders of Constellation CDIs.
 
(h)
            
Communication with Constellation CDI Holders
 
Constellation's Australian share registry will have access to the registration details and holding balances of each Constellation CDI holding. This will enable Constellation to communicate with the holders of Constellation CDIs when processing corporate actions, such as dividends, bonus issues and rights issues and when sending notices and announcements from Constellation, such as Constellation's annual report.

Voting Rights
 
/% of the aggregate number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, the holders of Constellation Shares will also become entitled to participate in the election of the remaining directors that would otherwise be elected solely by the holders of Constellation B Shares, and would vote together as a single class with holders of Constellation B Shares.  In this instance, holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Constellation B Shares are entitled to ten votes per share.  In the event that Constellation Shares (including shares represented by Constellation CDIs) representing the Scrip Consideration Cap are issued in connection with the Share Scheme, the number of outstanding Constellation B Shares will no longer represent 12/% of the aggregate number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares and, under such circumstances, the directors who are not elected by the holders of Constellation Shares voting as a separate class will be elected by the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares voting together as a single class, with holders of Constellation Shares having one vote per share and holders of Constellation B Shares having ten votes per share.
Holders of Constellation Shares, voting as a class, have the right to elect one fourth of the members (rounded to the next higher whole number if not evenly divisible by four) of the board of directors to be elected at a meeting of stockholders.

On all other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares vote together as a single class, except where a separate class vote is required under Delaware law.  Holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to one vote per share whereas holders of Constellation B Shares are entitled to ten votes per share.  There is no cumulative voting of either class of common stock.
 
Dividends
 
Constellation's board of directors  may declare a dividend on either class of Constellation's common stock or on both classes.  However, Constellation's board of directors may declare cash dividends payable to:
 
only the holders of Constellation Shares; or
 - 
                     
 
the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares,
 - 
                     
 
but not only to the holders of Constellation B Shares.
 
If Constellation pays a cash dividend on Constellation B Shares, each Constellation Share will receive a cash dividend at least 10% greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Constellation B Shares.
 
Conversion
 
Each Constellation B Share is convertible into one fully paid and non-assessable Constellation Share at the option of the holder at any time.  Constellation Shares are not convertible into or exchangeable for Constellation B Shares or any of Constellation's other securities.
 
Liquidation
 
In the event of a dissolution of Constellation, holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares will be treated as a single class with identical rights, and will share ratably in the distribution of assets that remain after Constellation pays all of its liabilities and satisfies its obligations to the holders of any outstanding preferred stock.
 
Preferred Stock
 
The board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock at any time, without stockholder approval.  It has the authority to determine all aspects of those shares, including the following:
 
the designation of the class or series and the number of shares;
 - 
                     
 
the voting rights, if any;
 - 
                     
 
       the dividend rate and preferences, if any, which that series of preferred stock will have compared to any other class or series of capital stock of Constellation;
 - 
 
the redemption price or prices and the other terms of redemption, if any, applicable to that series;
 - 
                     
 
the voluntary and involuntary liquidation rights and amounts payable upon liquidation;
 - 
                     
 
sinking fund provisions if any;
 - 
                     
 
the conversion or exchange privileges, if any, applicable to that series;
 - 
                     
 
any limitations or restrictions on Constellation's ability to declare dividends on other shares of capital stock;
 - 
                     
 
any conditions or restrictions on the creation of indebtedness or the issuance of other shares of capital stock;
 - 
                     
 
the ranking; and
 - 
                     
 
any other powers, rights and preferences.
 - 
                     
 
Any of these terms could have an adverse effect on the availability of earnings for distribution to the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares or for other corporate purposes.  Voting rights of holders of preferred shares could adversely affect the voting power of holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares holders and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or impeding a change of control of Constellation.  This could protect the continuity of Constellation's management and possibly deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell their Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares at prices higher than the prevailing market prices.

Rights Attaching to Constellation Shares
 
Constellation is incorporated in the United States under the laws of the State of Delaware, whereas BRL Hardy is incorporated under the laws of South Australia and is subject to the Corporations Act and the laws of Australia. If the Share Scheme is approved, BRL Shareholders, whose rights are currently governed by the laws of Australia and the constitution of BRL Hardy, will, upon implementation of the Share Scheme, become holders of Constellation Shares (or Constellation CDIs) if they elect Scrip Consideration, and their rights as such will be primarily governed by Delaware law, the U.S. Federal securities laws, the listing rules of the NYSE and Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws.
 
The rights of the holders of Constellation Shares are summarised below.
 
The summary of the rights of holders of Constellation Shares below does not contain all the information that may be important to you and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Delaware law, the U.S. Federal securities laws, and the governing corporate documents of Constellation.
 
Amendment of restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws
 
Under Delaware law, Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation may generally be amended if Constellation's board of directors adopts a resolution regarding an amendment and the amendment is approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock.  Constellation's bylaws may be amended by Constellation's board of directors, but Constellation's stockholders may also amend the by-laws or repeal amendments to the bylaws made by the board of directors.
 
Voting
 
The holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares have the following rights:
 
The holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares are entitled to vote as separate classes on all matters as to which a class vote is now, or hereafter may be, required by law.  Delaware law requires voting by separate classes only with respect to certificate of incorporation amendments that adversely affect the holders of those classes or (with some exceptions that would apply with respect to an increase or decrease in the number of authorised shares) that increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorised shares or the par value of the shares of any of those classes.
 - 
                     
 
The number of authorised Constellation Shares and/or Constellation B Shares may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the majority vote of all Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares voting as a single class, provided that the holders of Constellation Shares will have one vote per share and the holders of Constellation B Shares will have ten votes per share.
 - 
                     
 
At every meeting of stockholders called for the election of directors, the holders of Constellation Shares, voting as a class, are entitled to elect one-fourth of the number of directors to be elected at the meeting (rounded, if the total number of directors to be elected at this meeting is not evenly divisible by four, to the next higher whole number), and the holders of Constellation B Shares, voting as a class, are entitled to elect the remaining number of directors to be elected at such meeting.  Irrespective of the foregoing, if the number of outstanding Constellation B Shares is less than 12/% of the total number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, then the holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to elect one-fourth of the number of directors to be elected at the meeting (rounded, if the total number of directors to be elected at the meeting is not evenly divisible by four, to the next higher whole number) and are entitled to participate with the holders of Constellation B Shares voting as a single class in the election of the remaining number of directors to be elected at the meeting, provided that the holders of Constellation Shares shall have one vote per share and the holders of Constellation B Shares will have ten votes per share.  In the event that Constellation Shares (including shares represented by Constellation CDIs) representing the Scrip Consideration Cap are issued in connection with the Share Scheme, the number of outstanding Constellation B Shares will no longer represent 12/% of the aggregate number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares and, under such circumstances, the directors who are not elected
 -

by the holders of Constellation Shares voting as a separate class will be elected by the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares voting together as a single class, with holders of Constellation Shares having one vote per share and holders of Constellation B shares having ten votes per share.  If, during the interval between annual meetings for the election of directors, the number of directors who have been elected by either the holders of Constellation Shares or Constellation B Shares will, by reason of resignation, death, retirement, disqualification or removal, be reduced, the vacancy or vacancies in directors so created may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum or by a sole remaining director.  Any director so elected by the remaining directors to fill any of these vacancies may be removed from office by the vote of the holders of a majority of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares voting as a single class, provided that the holders of Constellation Shares will have one vote per share and the holders of Constellation B Shares will have 10 votes per share.
 
The holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, in all matters not specified above, vote together as a single class, provided that the holders of Constellation Shares will have one vote per share and the holders of Constellation B Shares will have 10 votes per share.
 - 
                     
 
There is no cumulative voting of either class of common stock.
 - 
                     
 
Based on stockholdings and the outstanding number of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares as of 31 January 2003 and assuming the issuance of the maximum number of Constellation Shares issuable pursuant to the Share Scheme, the Sands family would have the ability to vote approximately 55% of the votes cast by the holders of Constellation's outstanding capital stock, voting as a single class. Accordingly, the Sands family generally has sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to Constellation's stockholders for approval. See Section 7.6 of this Scheme Booklet.
 - 
                     
 
Dividends
 
Constellation's board of directors may declare a dividend on either class of its common stock or on both classes.  However, Constellation's board of directors may declare cash dividends payable to:
 
only the holders of Constellation Shares; or
 - 
                     
 
the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares,
 - 
                     
 
but not only to the holders of Constellation B Shares.
 
If Constellation pays a cash dividend on Constellation B Shares, each Constellation Share will receive a cash dividend at least 10% greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Constellation B Shares.
 
Directors: qualification and number of directors
 
Constellation's by-laws state that Constellation's board is to consist of one or more members.  The number of directors is determined from time to time by resolution of the board of directors.  Directors are elected at the annual meeting of stockholders. Directors hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified.  Directors need not be stockholders.  As of the date of this document, Constellation has seven directors.
 
Removal of directors and filling of vacancies
 
Any of Constellation's directors may resign at any time upon written notice to Constellation.
 
Vacancies on Constellation's board of directors resulting from death, resignation or otherwise (including newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors), may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose office is vacant, and until the election of a successor. Any director so elected by the remaining directors to fill any vacancy may be removed from office by vote of a majority of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, voting together as a single class.
 
Quorum requirements
 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares of capital stock entitled to cast a majority of the votes that could be cast at the meeting by the holders of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting constitutes a quorum.
 
Calling of stockholders meetings and notice required
 
Special meetings of Constellation's stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by a committee of the board of directors which has been duly designated by the board of directors, and whose powers and authority, as expressly provided in a resolution of the board of directors, include the power to call special meetings.  Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.
 
Written notice of the meeting shall be given stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.  Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at their address as it appears on the records of Constellation.
Stockholder action without a meeting
 
Constellation's stockholders may consent in writing without a meeting to the taking of any action that is required to be or may be taken at any annual or special meeting as long as written consents are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorise or to take this action if the actual meeting took place.
 
Delaware law provides that stockholders may, unless the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides, act by written consent to elect directors. However, if this consent is less than unanimous, this action by written consent may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting held at the effective time of this action are vacant and are filled by this action.
 
Corporate governance
 
Constellation's board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines that address:
 
selection of directors;
 - 
                     
 
operation of the board;
 - 
                     
 
composition and operation of standing audit, corporate governance and human resource committees;
 - 
                     
 
interaction with management; and
 - 
                     
 
evaluation of the board.
 - 
                     
 
Business of the annual stockholders meeting
 
Constellation will hold an annual stockholders meeting in each year at such place and on such date and at such time as Constellation's board of directors designates by resolution, for the purpose of electing directors and transacting any other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
 
Vote required for extraordinary corporate transaction
 
Delaware law provides that:
 
A domestic corporation may change its corporate name by amending its certificate of incorporation. The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment proposed, declaring its advisability and either calling a special meeting or directing that the amendment proposed be considered at the next annual meeting of stockholders.  The amendment will be adopted if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote at the annual or special meeting, and a majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote as a class, if applicable.
 - 
                     
 
A corporation may, by resolution of its board of directors, reduce its capital in any of four ways enumerated by Delaware law.
 - 
                     
 
A domestic corporation may convert to a limited liability company, limited partnership or business trust of Delaware if the board of directors adopts a resolution approving the conversion, specifying the type of entity into which the corporation will be converted and recommending the approval of the conversion by the stockholders of the corporation. This resolution must be submitted to the stockholders of the corporation at an annual or special meeting and must be approved by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock of the corporation, whether voting or non-voting.
 - 
                     
 
To dissolve a corporation, the board must adopt a resolution deeming it advisable that the corporation be dissolved.  The resolution must be adopted by a majority of the entire board at any meeting called for that purpose.  The proposed dissolution must receive the affirmative vote of the majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote at the stockholder meeting at which the proposed dissolution is presented.  Dissolution of the corporation may also be authorised without action of the directors if all the stockholders entitled to vote on the dissolution consent in writing and a certificate of dissolution is filed with the Secretary of State.
 - 
                     
 
Provisions affecting business combinations including mergers
 
Delaware law generally provides that any person that acquires 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock may not engage in any business combination for three years following the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:
 
the board of directors of the corporation has approved, prior to the acquisition date, either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder;
 - 
                     
 
upon consummation of the transaction, the transaction resulted in the person owning at least 85% of the corporation's voting stock (excluding shares owned by directors who are officers and shares owned by employee stock plans in which participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or
 - 
                     
 
the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorised by the vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.
 - 
                     
 
These restrictions on interested stockholders do not apply under some circumstances, including if the corporation, by action of its stockholders, adopts an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws expressly electing not to be governed by these provisions of Delaware law.  The amendment will be effective twelve months thereafter.
 
Delaware law requires approval of mergers or consolidations by a majority of the outstanding voting stock, unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation specifies a different percentage.  Neither Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation nor Constellation's by-laws contain a provision electing not to be governed by these provisions of Delaware law.
The Sands family controls a majority of the total votes entitled to be cast by the holders of Constellation's capital stock and, accordingly generally has, sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to Constellation's stockholders for approval.  See Section 7.6 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
Right to inspect corporate books and records
 
Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation is on file with the Secretary of State of Delaware and the U.S. SEC.  Constellation's by-laws are on file with the U.S. SEC.
 
Delaware law provides that any stockholder shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, stockholder list and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  If the corporation refuses to permit the stockholder's inspection or does not reply to the stockholder's written demand within five (5) business days, the stockholder may seek remedy in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
 
Right to inspect the stockholder list
 
Delaware law and Constellation's by-laws provide that for every stockholder meeting, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting must be made and be open to examination of any stockholder during ordinary business hours for at least ten days prior to the meeting either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the offices of the transfer agent.
 
Delaware law provides that the stockholder list may also be made available on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting.  The list must be produced at the meeting and be subject at all times during the meeting to the inspection of any stockholder present.
 
Derivative action and shareholder class action suits
 
Under Delaware common law, a stockholder may bring a derivative action on behalf of the corporation where those in control of the corporation have refused to assert a claim belonging to the corporation (and to the stockholder collectively).
 
Under Delaware law, a stockholder who wishes to bring a derivative suit must meet certain eligibility and standing requirements, including requirements that the plaintiff has been a stockholder of the corporation at the time of the act of which he complains and that he maintains his status as a stockholder throughout the course of the litigation.  In addition, a derivative plaintiff must make a demand on the directors of the corporation to assert the corporate claim, unless that demand would be futile.
 
Settlement or dismissal of a derivative action requires the approval of the Court and notice to stockholders of the proposed dismissal.
 
Indemnification of officers and directors
 
Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify a director, officer, employee or agent against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably (other than in an action by or in the right of the corporation) incurred by such individual, provided the individual acted in good faith and in a manner the individual reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe the conduct was unlawful.  For actions or suits brought by or in the name of the corporation, a corporation may indemnify a director, or officer, employee or agent against expenses incurred if the individual acted in good faith and in manner the individual reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that if the individual is adjudged to be liable to the corporation, the individual can be indemnified if and only to the extent that a court determines that despite the adjudication of liability, the individual is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity.
 
Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation provides that it will indemnify each director and officer to the fullest extent permitted by law.
 
However, with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, Constellation is required to indemnify any indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by an indemnitee only if the proceeding (or part thereof) was authorised by the board of directors of Constellation.
 
Fiduciary duties and directors' liability
 
Delaware law provides that a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation a provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.  However, the provision may not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for:
 
breach of the duty of loyalty;
 - 
                     
 
acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
 - 
                     
 
unlawful payments of dividends, certain stock repurchases or redemptions; or
 - 
                     
 
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
 - 
                     
 
Constellation's restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision limiting the personal liability of a director for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except as restricted by Delaware law.
 
Transactions involving directors and officers
 
Delaware law provides that a contract or transaction between a corporation and one or more of its directors or officers will not be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of
the board or committee which authorises the contract or transaction, or solely because that director's or officer's votes are counted for this purpose, if:
 
the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors or the committee, and the board or committee in good faith authorises the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors may be less than a quorum; or
 - 
                     
 
the material facts as to the director's or officer's relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote on the matter, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by a vote of the stockholders; or
 - 
                     
 
the contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorised, approved or ratified, by the board of directors, a committee or the stockholders.
 - 
                     
 
Delaware law further provides that interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board of directors or of a committee which authorised the contract or transaction.
 
7.5
                              
Post-acquisition Capital Structure
 
As at 31 January 2003 78,583,491 Constellation Shares and 12,077,090 Constellation B Shares were issued and outstanding. In the event that the Share Scheme is implemented and BRL Shareholders elect to receive such number of Constellation Shares  (or Constellation CDIs) as is equal to the Scrip Consideration Cap, then under the Share Scheme, 15,000,000 additional Constellation Shares would be issued. Such shares would represent approximately 16.0% of the Constellation Shares then issued and outstanding, assuming no additional Constellation Shares are issued from 31 January 2003. In addition, assuming no additional issuances, such shares would have approximately 7.0% of the combined total voting power of the Constellation Shares and the Constellation B Shares.
 
7.6
                              
Constellation is controlled by the Sands Family
 
/% of the aggregate number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares, as a single class, are entitled to elect such remaining directors.  On all matters where the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares vote together as a single class (including the election of directors, if applicable), holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Constellation B Shares are entitled to ten votes per share.  Assuming the issuance in connection with the Share Scheme of Constellation Shares (including shares represented by Constellation CDIs) representing the Scrip Consideration Cap:
Constellation's outstanding capital stock consists of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares. Holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to elect, as a class, one fourth of the members of Constellation's board of directors.  Holders of Constellation B Shares are entitled to elect, as a class, the remaining directors, except that, if the number of outstanding Constellation B Shares is less than 12
1
2
 
the number of outstanding Constellation B Shares will no longer represent 12/% of the aggregate number of outstanding Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares and, accordingly, the directors who are not elected by the holders of Constellation Shares voting as a separate class will be elected by the holders of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares voting together as a single class, with holders of Constellation Shares having one vote per share and holders of Constellation B shares having ten votes per share;
 - 
                     
1
2
 
based on stockholdings and the outstanding number of Constellation Shares and Constellation B Shares as of 31 January 2003, the Sands family would beneficially own approximately 5%of the outstanding Constellation Shares (exclusive of Constellation Shares issuable pursuant to the conversion feature of Constellation B Shares owned by the Sands family) and approximately 94% of the outstanding Constellation B Shares; and
 - 
                     
 
on all matters other than the election of one-quarter of the directors by the holders of Constellation Shares as a separate class (and limited other matters where the holders of Constellation Shares are entitled to vote as a separate class), the Sands family would have had the ability to vote approximately 55% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of Constellation's outstanding capital stock.
 - 
                     
 
Consequently, Constellation is essentially controlled by the Sands family and they would generally have sufficient voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors of Constellation and to determine the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to Constellation's stockholders for approval.
 
7.7
                              
Provision of Consideration
 
(a)
             
Cash Consideration and Option Scheme Consideration
 
The consideration due to Scheme Shareholders under the Share Scheme may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by the payment of cash.  In addition, Constellation Australia will lend to BRL Hardy an amount equal to the total cash consideration payable to Scheme Option Holders under the Option Scheme and to the holders of Non-Executive Options upon the cancellation of such Non-Executive Options ("").
Option Cancellation Loan
If all BRL Shareholders elect to receive the Cash Consideration, the total cash amount required to enable Constellation Australia to pay the Cash Consideration to Scheme Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme and to fund the Option Cancellation Loan is approximately $1,898 million ("").  In addition, Constellation Australia will on the Implementation Date, provide BRL Hardy with approximately $558.2 million as at 15 January 2003 in capital in the form of debt, equity or a combination thereof, to permit BRL Hardy to repay the BRL Hardy Debt.
Maximum Cash Requirement
 
The cash required to fund the Maximum Cash Requirement (to the extent necessary based on the Elections of the Scheme Shareholders) and the loan to satisfy the BRL Hardy Debt will be provided through a combination of the following:
 
existing cash resources of Constellation;
 - 
                      
a portion of the aggregate US$1.6 billion Credit Facilities available under the 2003 Credit Agreement; and
 - 
                      
to the extent required, the US$450 million Bridging Facility  provided under the Bridge Agreement.
 - 
                      
 
Constellation Australia will obtain the cash sum necessary to pay the Cash Consideration due to Scheme Shareholders and to lend BRL Hardy the Option Cancellation Loan and the amount necessary to satisfy the BRL Hardy Debt through a series of agreements between a number of direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Constellation.  The combined effect of the agreements will be that funds equal to such cash sum will be made available to Constellation Australia immediately after the borrowing by Constellation under the Credit Facilities and the Bridging Facility of funds of the same or greater amount.  The only condition precedent to the payment of such funds to Constellation Australia through the series of agreements will be that Constellation must first have borrowed funds under the Credit Facilities and the Bridging Facility. Once this has occurred, the obligations on Constellation and each of the subsidiaries in turn, to provide the funds necessary to pay such cash sum, will be irrevocable and the funds will not be repayable while Constellation Australia has any outstanding obligation to pay cash under the Share Scheme or the Option Cancellation Loan.
 
Constellation has purchased an option to hedge the currency risk associated with the projected Australian cash requirements necessary for the payment of the Cash Consideration to Scheme Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme, funding the Option Cancellation Loan and payment of the BRL Hardy Debt.
 
Existing cash resources
 
As at the date of this Scheme Booklet, Constellation has available to it cash of approximately US$25 million to fund the cash consideration payable under the Schemes.
 
Credit Facilities
 
The aggregate Credit Facilities of US$1.6 billion committed by the Lenders under the 2003 Credit Agreement consist of a US$400.0 million Tranche A term loan facility, a US$800.0 million Tranche B term loan facility and a US$400.0 million revolving credit facility.  For a description of certain terms of the 2003 Credit Agreement and the Credit Facilities, see Section 3.5(d) of this Scheme Booklet under the caption "New Senior Credit Facility".
 
Constellation intends to fund a portion of the Maximum Cash Requirement (to the extent necessary based on the Elections of the Scheme Shareholders) and the loan to satisfy the BRL Hardy Debt from borrowings under the Tranche A term loan, Tranche B term loan, and a portion of the revolving credit facility.
 
Upon Constellation having satisfied customary funding conditions (such conditions are collectively referred to herein as the "") on or immediately following the Effective Date of the Share Scheme, it is envisaged that the Tranche A and Tranche B term loans under the 2003 Credit Agreement will be funded in full to refinance the 2000 Credit Agreement and to pay certain transaction expenses.  The remaining portion of such loan proceeds will concurrently be deposited into a cash collateral account (the ""). Once a transfer or transfers of all shares in BRL Hardy have been delivered into the CHESS system and certain other conditions have been satisfied (such conditions are collectively referred to herein as the ""), the funds on deposit in the Cash Collateral Account will be released on the Implementation Date and will be used, in combination with the proceeds from the concurrent funding of loans under the Bridging Facility and revolving credit facility under the 2003 Credit Agreement (as needed), to (i) pay the Cash Consideration to the Scheme Shareholders, (ii) fund the Option Cancellation Loan and (iii) fund a Loan to BRL Hardy to permit it to repay the BRL Hardy Debt.
Credit Agreement Funding Conditions
Cash Collateral Account
Credit Agreement Release Conditions
 
Except for the Market Condition and the MAC Condition referred to below (over which Constellation has little or no control), Constellation believes that all Credit Agreement Funding Conditions and Credit Agreement Release Conditions will be fulfilled.
 
The Credit Agreement Funding Conditions include the following conditions:
 
Constellation having paid such fees as may be required under the 2003 Credit Agreement and delivered certain documentation that is customarily required in credit agreements of this type, including but not limited to, opinions of counsel, certain corporate documents, an officer's certificate, certain pledge agreements, and copies of documents governing the acquisition of BRL Hardy;
(i)
                 
Constellation having provided evidence that the Bridge Agreement is in full force and effect;
(ii)
              
 
Constellation not having (a) entered into or made any amendments to certain material provisions of the Implementation Deed or (b) exercised its discretion in respect of a "BRL Hardy Prescribed Occurrence" (as defined in the Implementation Deed) where such BRL Hardy Prescribed Occurrence is reasonably likely to result in a "BRL Hardy Material Adverse Change" (as defined in the Implementation Deed);
(iii)
           
 
certain representations of Constellation being true and correct;
(iv)
          
 
certain defaults under the 2003 Credit Agreement not having occurred;
(v)
             
 
prior to and during the syndication of the Credit Facilities there not having been any offering, placement or arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing by or on behalf of Constellation or BRL Hardy in competition with the Credit Facilities;
(vi)
          
 
Constellation not having received from any Lender party to the 2003 Credit Agreement on 16 January 2003 ("Initial Lender") written notice prior to 8.00 am (Adelaide time) on the date of the Share Scheme Meeting to the effect that there has occurred a material disruption of or material adverse change in the financial, banking or capital market conditions that, in the reasonable judgment of such Initial Lender, has materially impaired the syndication of the Credit Facilities ("Market Condition");
(vii)
       
 
Constellation not having received written notice from any Initial Lender prior to 8.00 a.m. on the date of the Share Scheme Meeting to the effect that, since 28 February 2002, there has been a material adverse change in the business, assets, operations or condition, financial or otherwise, of Constellation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (for the purposes of this condition, Constellation's subsidiaries will include BRL Hardy and its subsidiaries) ("MAC Condition");
(viii)
    
 
the Court having approved the Share Scheme; and
(ix)
            
 
certain other conditions that are customarily required in credit agreements of this type.
(x)
               
 
The Market Condition and the MAC Condition are deemed to be satisfied if Constellation has not received the requisite notice by the date of the Share Scheme Meeting, as described in clauses (vii) and (viii) above.  However, if the Effective Date in relation to the Share Scheme has not occurred by the 10th business day following the date of the Share Scheme Meeting, then the Market Condition and the MAC Condition are reinstated and remain in effect as conditions precedent to funding up to 8:00 a.m. (Adelaide, Australia time) on the Second Court Date.
 
The Credit Agreement Release Conditions includes the following conditions:
 
the delivery of a transfer or transfers of all Scheme Shares into the CHESS system and registration of the transfer or transfers in the name of Constellation Australia;
(i)
                 
 
the Lenders having a perfected security interest in the Scheme Shares;
(ii)
              
 
Constellation having repaid (or repaying simultaneously with the funding of the loans) the indebtedness outstanding under its existing credit facility and the BRL Hardy Debt; and
(iii)
           
 
the conditions precedent in Section 4.1(a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o) of the Implementation Deed having been satisfied or waived or having ceased to have effect; and
(iv)
          
 
all of the Credit Agreement Release Conditions (and before then all Credit Agreement Funding Conditions) being satisfied on or before the termination date described in Section 2.4 of this Scheme Booklet.
(v)
             
 
Bridging Facility
 
The Bridge Agreement provides for commitments of the Bridge Lenders of up to, in the aggregate, U.S.$450.0 million in bridge loans.  For a description of certain terms of the Bridge Agreement and the Bridging Facility, see Section 3.5(d) of this Scheme Booklet under the caption "Bridging Facility".
 
To the extent necessary, Constellation intends to fund the Maximum Cash Requirement (to the extent necessary based on the Elections of the Scheme Shareholders) and the loan to satisfy the BRL Hardy Debt from borrowings under the Bridging Facility. The obligations of the Bridge Lenders to make loans under the Bridge Agreement become effective on the date Constellation has satisfied conditions that are substantially similar to the Credit Agreement Funding Conditions and Credit Agreement Release Conditions.
 
(b)
              
Scrip Consideration
 
The Scrip Consideration due to Scheme Shareholders under the Share Scheme will be satisfied by Constellation Australia procuring the issue of Constellation Scrip.  The number of Constellation Shares to be issued under the Share Scheme to Scheme Shareholders will not exceed 15,000,000 Constellation Shares, the Scrip Consideration Cap.
 
Accordingly, if all BRL Shareholders elect to receive the Scrip Consideration, the total number of Constellation Shares that Constellation Australia will become obliged to procure the issue of pursuant to the Share Scheme is the Scrip Consideration Cap.
 
Constellation has agreed to issue such Constellation Shares as is necessary for Constellation Australia to satisfy the provision of Scrip Consideration to Scheme Shareholders up to the Scrip Consideration Cap. The obligation on Constellation to issue such Constellation Shares as is necessary for Constellation Australia to satisfy the provision of Scrip Consideration up to the Scrip Consideration Cap to Scheme Shareholders is irrevocable.

Key Features of Option Scheme and Considerations for BRL Option Holders
 
 
Section
8
 
This Section should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this Scheme Booklet.
 
8.1
                              
Overview
 
On 17 January 2003, BRL Hardy and Constellation announced a proposal to merge. Under the proposal:
 
Constellation Australia, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation will acquire all of the BRL Shares by way of the Share Scheme; and
 - 
                            
 
all of the Options will be cancelled by way of the Option Scheme.
 - 
                            
 
If the Share Scheme is implemented, BRL Hardy will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation and will be delisted from the ASX.
 
The Option Scheme is subject to a number of conditions including:
 
approval of the Share Scheme by the Court;
 - 
                            
 
approval of the Resolution by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders; and
 - 
                            
 
approval of the Option Scheme by the Court.
 - 
                            
 
Important dates are set out on page 1 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
8.2
                              
Relationship with the Share Scheme
 
If the Share Scheme is not approved by the Court or the Resolution is not approved by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders, the Option Scheme will not be implemented, whether or not the Option Scheme is approved by Option Holders.
 
If the Share Scheme is implemented and:
 
the Option Scheme is implemented, the Options will be cancelled and each Scheme Option Holder will receive the Option Scheme Consideration; and
 - 
                            
 
the Option Scheme is not implemented, the Options will not be cancelled and will continue to be held by Option Holders.  However, BRL Hardy will shortly thereafter cease to be listed on the ASX.
 - 
                            
 
The Share Scheme is not conditional on the Option Scheme becoming Effective. Therefore the Share Scheme can proceed even if the Option Scheme does not proceed.  Constellation has indicated that if the Share Scheme proceeds but the Option Scheme is not implemented for any reason, Constellation Australia intends to exercise its rights under Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act to compulsorily acquire the Options.  The price payable on compulsory acquisition of the Options must be a fair value for the Options in the opinion of an independent expert approved by ASIC.
 
8.3
                              
What will you receive?
 
If the Option Scheme is implemented, Option Holders will receive a cash amount equal to the Option Scheme Consideration.
 
The Option Scheme Consideration in respect of each Scheme Option is:
 
the cash amount of $10.50 less the Exercise Price for that Scheme Option; and
(a)
                    
 
in the case of any Scheme Option which was on issue as at 19 September 2001, an additional cash amount of $0.12.
(b)
                   
 
The additional cash amount of $0.12 referred to in paragraph (b) above is payable to Option Holders who, under the terms of the rights issue made by BRL Hardy in September 2001, were given the right to subscribe for 1 additional BRL Share at a subscription price of $9.30 for every 10 Options then held.  The subscription rights are only exercisable on exercise of the Options to which they relate and will therefore lapse if the Options are cancelled under the Option Scheme.
 
The additional cash amount of $0.12 per Option represents the value attributable to that subscription right, calculated as one tenth of the difference between the Cash Consideration amount of $10.50 which would have been received by an Option Holder who had exercised the subscription right and the $9.30 subscription price which would have been payable to exercise that right.
8.4
                              
Directors recommend that you vote in favour
 
Your Directors believe that the Option Scheme is in the best interests of Option Holders and your Directors unanimously recommend that in absence of a higher offer you vote in favour of the Option Scheme. The reasons for your Directors' recommendation are outlined below.
 
All Directors who hold Options intend to vote in favour of the Option Scheme.
 
Details of the interests of Directors are provided in Section 11.4.
 
8.5
                              
Reasons to vote in favour of the Option Scheme
 
(a)
              
Fair value to Option Holders
 
The Option Scheme Consideration represents a substantial premium to the in-the-money' value of the Options based on the price at which BRL Shares traded immediately and for a number of months prior to the announcement of discussions with respect to the Merger. The Option Scheme Consideration provides fair and immediate compensation to Option Holders as a whole in respect of Options which are to be cancelled under the Option Scheme.
 
(b)
              
The Independent Expert has concluded that the Option Scheme is in the best interests of BRL Option Holders
 
Deloitte Corporate Finance Pty Limited was appointed by BRL Hardy to prepare an Independent Expert's Report in relation to the Schemes. It has concluded that, in the absence of a higher offer, the Option Scheme is in the best interests of Option Holders as a whole.  The Independent Expert's Report is set out in Section 19 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
(c)
              
If the Share Scheme is implemented but the Option Scheme is not implemented, the Options will be over unlisted securities
 
If the Share Scheme is implemented, it is intended that BRL Shares will be delisted from the ASX as BRL Hardy will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation.  It follows that if the Share Scheme is implemented, but the Option Scheme is not implemented, any unconverted Options would only be able to convert into shares in an unlisted company.  This would result in value realisation being uncertain for the relevant holders.
 
(d)
              
If the Share Scheme is implemented but the Option Scheme is not implemented, the Options may be compulsorily acquired
 
The right of an Option Holder to continue to hold an option or any BRL Share received upon the exercise of an Option will be subject to any power of Constellation Australia to compulsorily acquire that security under Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act. Constellation has indicated that Constellation Australia intends to exercise its rights under Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act to compulsorily acquire the Options if the Share Scheme is implemented but the Option Scheme is not implemented for any reason.  The compulsory acquisition price must be a fair value for the Options in the opinion of an independent expert approved by ASIC.
 
8.6
                              
Relevant Considerations Against the Option Scheme
 
(a)
              
No Longer Able to Acquire BRL Shares
 
If the Option Scheme is implemented, Option Holders will no longer be able to acquire a direct shareholding in BRL Hardy.
 
(b)
              
Capital gains tax consequences
 
For Australian resident Option Holders, implementation of the Option Scheme will result in a taxable event occurring in relation to the Options cancelled under the Option Scheme for the purposes of CGT.
 
If the Option Scheme does not proceed, there are no CGT consequences for Option Holders while they continue to hold their Options.  If the Options are compulsorily acquired, a CGT taxable event may occur.
 
Any capital gain arising under the Option Scheme or as a result of compulsory acquisition may be eligible for a 50% general CGT Discount.
 
8.7
                              
Other relevant considerations
 
(a)
              
Time Value of Options
 
The formula for the determination for the Option Scheme Consideration to be received by each Option Holder under the Option Scheme is based upon the Exercise Price of each Option and does not expressly take into account the Exercise Date of that Option and the potential that the Option will increase in value during the time prior to expiry.
 
Nevertheless, the value of the Option Scheme Consideration is fair and immediate compensation to Option Holders as a whole for the cancellation of their Options.  The Option Scheme Consideration represents a substantial premium to the in-the-money' value of the Options based on the price at which BRL Shares traded immediately and for a number of months prior to the announcement of discussions with respect to the Merger.
(b)
              
Implications of Voting "No"
 
If you vote "No", that does not mean that the Option Scheme will not be implemented. If the Option Scheme is approved by the necessary majority of Option Holders and by the Court, your Options will be cancelled and you will receive the Option Scheme Consideration even though you may have voted against the Option Scheme.
 
8.8
                              
Implications of Failure to Approve the Option Scheme
 
(a)
              
No Payment of Option Consideration
 
Your Directors have recommended that Option Holders vote in favour of the Option Scheme for the reasons set out earlier in this Section.  In particular they believe that the Option Consideration is in the best interest of Option Holders as a whole.  Should the Option Scheme not proceed, the Option Scheme Consideration will not be paid.
 
(b)
              
Additional Risks if Share Scheme Approved
 
As discussed above, Option Holders could be disadvantaged if the Option Scheme is not implemented, but the Share Scheme is implemented, as the Options will no longer be related to shares in a listed company.  Further, Option Holders rights may also be subject to any power of Constellation Australia to compulsorily acquire those Options or any BRL Shares resulting from their exercise, under Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act.  See further Sections 8.2 and 8.5(d).
 
8.9
                              
Conditions of the Option Scheme
 
The Option Scheme is conditional upon the satisfaction or the waiver of all the conditions contained in the Implementation Deed.  For further details refer to Section 1.9.
 
8.10
                       
Right to inspect and obtain copy of Option Register
 
Under the Corporations Act, any Option Holder has a right to inspect and to ask for a copy of the option register kept by BRL Hardy which contains details of the name and address of all Option Holders and other details regarding the terms of the Options.  A copy of the Option Register will be made available to an Option Holder upon request and payment of the prescribed fee under the Corporations Act.
Option Scheme Implementation
 
 
Section
9
 
9.1
                              
Overall effect of the Option Scheme
 
The Option Scheme, if implemented, will result in all of the Options being cancelled in return for the Option Scheme Consideration.
 
The Option Scheme is subject to a number of conditions including:
 
approval of the Share Scheme by the Court;
 - 
                      
 
approval of the Resolution by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders; and
 - 
                      
 
approval of the Option Scheme by the Court.
 - 
                      
 
9.2
                              
Classes of creditors of BRL Hardy affected by the Option Scheme
 
The only class of creditors of BRL Hardy who will be affected by the Option Scheme are the Option Holders.  The financial assistance referred to in Section 2.13 will also affect the interests of creditors, as will the borrowing of the Option Cancellation Loan. However, as the Option Cancellation Loan is being lent to BRL Hardy on the basis that it will be converted to capital in BRLHardy by Constellation Australia shortly after the Schemes have been implemented, the Directors believe that the proposed loan arrangement will not be prejudicial to creditors of BRL Hardy.  Furthermore, the position of creditors will be improved by the extent to which Constellation contributes equity capital as contemplated in Section 7.7(a). For further details in relation to the financial assistance refer to Section 2.13.
 
The effect of the Option Scheme on the Scheme Option Holders is that the Options held by each such holder will be cancelled and the rights attached to those Options will be surrendered in return for receiving the Option Scheme Consideration.
 
9.3
                              
Steps in implementing the Option Scheme
 
On 17 January 2003, Constellation and BRL Hardy entered into the Implementation Deed in relation to the Option Scheme (and the Share Scheme) under which BRL Hardy agreed to propose the Option Scheme.  A copy of the Implementation Deed is included in Section 12 and a copy of the Option Scheme is included in Section 15.
(a)
              
 
On 10 February 2003 the Court ordered that BRL Hardy convene a meeting of Option Holders at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003 commencing at 11.00 am (Adelaide time), for the purposes of approving the Option Scheme.
(b)
             
 
BRL Hardy will apply to the Court for orders approving the Option Scheme if:
(c)
              
 
the Share Scheme is approved by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders voting at the Share Scheme Meeting and by the Court;
 - 
                      
 
the Resolution is approved by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders voting at the General Meeting;
 - 
                      
 
the Option Scheme is approved by the requisite majority of Option Holders voting at the Option Scheme Meeting; and
 - 
                      
 
all other conditions to the Option Scheme in clause 2.1 of the Option Scheme have been satisfied or waived.
 - 
                      
 
If the Resolution is passed by the requisite majority, BRL Hardy will lodge this with ASIC on the date on which it is passed.
(d)
             
 
If the Court order relating to the Option Scheme referred to in paragraph (c) above is obtained, then  BRL Hardy will lodge with ASIC office copies of the Court order under section 411 of the Corporations Act approving the Option Scheme.
(e)
              
If the Option Scheme becomes Effective then on the Implementation Date, all of the Scheme Options and all rights and entitlements attaching to the Scheme Options will be cancelled without the need for any further act by any Scheme Option Holder.
(f)
                
 
If the Option Scheme becomes Effective then BRL Hardy will pay to each Scheme Option Holder the Option Scheme Consideration within 5 Business Days after the later of the Implementation Date and the date which is 14 days after the Resolution is lodged with ASIC as required by section 260B of the Corporations Act.
(g)
             
 
The Option Scheme will lapse and be of no further force or effect if the Implementation Deed is terminated.
(h)
             
 
9.4
                              
Termination of the Implementation Deed
 
The Option Scheme is conditional upon the Implementation Deed having not been terminated as at the Court Hearing Time.
 
The Implementation Deed may be terminated in the circumstances described in Section 2.4.
 
9.5
                              
Court ordered meetings of Option Holders
 
On 10 February 2003 the Court ordered that BRL Hardy convene a meeting of Option Holders at The Auditorium, Adelaide Town Hall, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia on 20 March 2003 commencing at 11.00 am (Adelaide time), for the purposes of approving the Option Scheme.
 
The notice convening this meeting is set out in Section 16 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
Each Option Holder who is registered on the register of Option Holders maintained by BRL Hardy at 10.00 pm (Adelaide time) on 18 March 2003 is entitled to attend and vote, in person or by proxy or attorney or, in the case of a corporation which is an Option Holder, by its representative appointed in accordance with the Corporations Act, at the Option Scheme Meeting.
 
For actions to be taken by Option Holders who propose to attend and vote at the Option Scheme Meeting or to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on the Option Holder's behalf, see page 12 of this Scheme Booklet.
 
9.6
                              
Voting majority required
 
The voting majority to approve the Option Scheme requires votes in favour of the Option Scheme to be received from:
 
a majority in number (more than 50%) of Option Holders present and voting at the Option Scheme Meeting (in person, by proxy or by attorney);
 - 
                      
 
Option Holders who together hold at least 75% of the Options voted at the Option Scheme Meeting.
 - 
                      
 
9.7
                              
Opposing the Option Scheme
 
The Corporations Act and the Corporations Rules 2000 of South Australia provide a procedure for Option Holders to oppose the approval by the Court of the Option Scheme.  If you are an Option Holder and wish to oppose the approval of the Option Scheme at the Second Court Hearing you may do so by filing with the Court and serving on BRL Hardy a notice of appearance in the prescribed form together with any affidavit on which you wish to rely at the hearing. The notice of appearance and affidavit must be served on BRL Hardy at least one day before the date fixed for the Second Court Hearing.  That date is currently scheduled to occur on 27 March 2003.  Any change to this date will be announced through the ASX and notified on BRL Hardy's website, www.brlhardy.com.au.
9.8
                              
Effective Date
 
The Option Scheme will become Effective on the date when an office copy of the order of the Court approving the Option Scheme has been lodged with ASIC or such earlier date as the Court determines and specifies in the Court order.
 
BRL Hardy will notify the ASX upon the Option Scheme becoming Effective.
 
Once the Option Scheme becomes Effective, BRL Hardy will become bound to implement the Option Scheme in accordance with its terms.
 
9.9
                              
Provision of Option Scheme Consideration
 
Subject to the Option Scheme becoming effective, BRL Hardy will be entitled to draw down under the Option Cancellation Loan such funds as are necessary to pay each Scheme Option Holder the Option Scheme Consideration.
 
Within 5 Business Days after the later of the Implementation Date and the date which is 14 days after the Resolution is lodged with ASIC, cheques payable to Scheme Option Holders will be sent by prepaid post to each Scheme Option Holder at the person's address as shown on the register of Option Holders maintained by BRL Hardy.

Stamp duty
 
No duty is payable on the cancellation of options in a listed company.
Tax Implications of Share Scheme and Option Scheme
 
Section 10
Tax Implications of Share Scheme and Option Scheme
BRL SHAREHOLDERS AND OPTION HOLDERS ARE STRONGLY URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE SHARE SCHEME AND OPTION SCHEME, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS IN THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
 
10.1        : Australian Residents
Tax Considerations for Share Scheme
 
(a)           Introduction
 
The following is a general description of the material  Australian and U.S. income tax and CGT consequences for Australian resident BRL Shareholders upon the transfer of the BRL Shares in consideration for (depending on the alternative chosen by the BRL Shareholder):
 
    Cash Consideration of $10.50 per BRL Share; or
 - 
 
    Scrip Consideration; or
 - 
 
    any combination of Scrip Consideration and Cash Consideration.
 - 
 
This summary applies only to BRL Shareholders who hold their BRL Shares (and Scrip Consideration acquired under the Share Scheme) on capital account. This summary addresses:
 
    the Australian CGT consequences of the Share Scheme;
 - 
 
    the income tax consequences in Australia of receiving dividends on the Scrip Consideration;
 - 
 
    the CGT consequences in Australia of disposing of the Scrip Consideration;
 - 
 
    the income tax consequences under the Australian Foreign Investment Fund rules of holding the Scrip Consideration; and
 - 
 
    the Australian stamp duty consequences of the Share Scheme.

disposal
(b)           Implementation of the Share Scheme and
of BRL Shares  Capital Gains or Losses
 
The transfer of BRL Shares pursuant to the Share Scheme will involve the disposal of BRL Shares to Constellation. This change in ownership of BRL Shares will constitute a CGT event for Australian CGT purposes. The effective date of disposal for CGT purposes will be the Implementation Date.
 
Accordingly, a BRL Shareholder may make a capital gain or a capital loss depending on whether the capital proceeds from the disposal of BRL Shares are more than the cost base (as indexed, in some cases (see below)) of those BRL Shares (in which case a capital gain would arise), or less than the reduced cost base of those BRL Shares (in which case a capital loss would arise). The Australian income tax implications will vary depending on the option elected by the BRL Shareholders. Each of these are outlined below.
 
A shareholder's capital gains and capital losses from all sources recognised in an income year are aggregated to determine whether there is a net capital gain or net capital loss. The net capital gain (if any) is included in assessable income and is subject to income tax. Net capital losses may (subject to certain restrictions for companies) be carried forward indefinitely and set against future capital gains. However, net capital losses cannot be offset against any other income.
For those BRL Shareholders who are nonresidents for Australian tax purposes, provided such shareholders and their associates (broadly defined) hold less than 10 percent of the issued shares of BRL Hardy, the disposal of their BRL Shares will have no consequences for Australian CGT purposes.
 
A BRL Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income tax on the sale or exchange of the BRL Shares pursuant to the Share Scheme unless such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the BRL Shareholder in the United States.
 
BRL Shareholders electing to receive Cash Consideration
 
BRL Shareholders electing to receive Cash Consideration only will make a capital gain or capital loss depending on whether the Cash Consideration they receive is more or less than the cost base in BRL Shares. Some BRL Shareholders may be eligible to index the cost of their BRL Shares or discount any capital gain (refer below).
 
The cost base of the BRL Shares will generally be their cost of acquisition and any incidental costs of acquisition (such as brokerage and stamp duty).
 
BRL Shareholder electing to receive Scrip Consideration only
 
If, as a result of the Share Scheme, Constellation acquires 80% or more of the BRL Shares, BRL Shareholders who receive Scrip Consideration and who would make a capital gain from the disposal of their BRL Shares may choose roll-over relief. Generally, if a BRL Shareholder chooses roll-over relief, then any capital gain is deferred until the BRL Shareholder sells or otherwise disposes of the  Scrip Consideration that the BRL Shareholder received pursuant to the Share Scheme.
 
Roll-over is not available where the BRL Shareholder would make a capital loss from the disposal of BRL Shares.
The aggregate cost base of the Scrip Consideration will equal the aggregate cost base of the BRL Shares.
 
If a BRL Shareholder chooses not to (or cannot) elect for roll-over relief, the BRL Shareholder will be treated as realising a capital gain or a capital loss equal to the difference between the cost base of the BRL Shares and the market value of the Scrip Consideration on the Implementation Date.
 
The cost base of the BRL Shares will generally be their cost of acquisition and any incidental costs of acquisition (such as brokerage and stamp duty).
 
BRL Shareholders electing to receive a combination of Scrip Consideration and Cash Consideration
 
For BRL Shareholders who receive a combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration, roll-over is not available in respect of the Cash Consideration. If roll-over is chosen in respect of the Scrip Consideration (as outlined above), in calculating the capital gain realised in respect of the Cash Consideration, the cost base of the BRL Shares should be reasonably apportioned between the Scrip Consideration and the Cash Consideration received pursuant to the Share Scheme. This apportionment will depend on the specific combination of Scrip Consideration and Cash Consideration received by the BRL Shareholder together with the final Scrip Exchange Ratio as noted in Section 1.2 above. Except where separate acceptances for separate parcels of BRL Shares have been made, the percentage of the Cash Consideration to the total market value of the consideration received should be used to calculate the percentage of the cost base attributable to the cash component.
 
If a BRL Shareholder chooses not to (or cannot) elect for roll-over relief, the BRL Shareholder will be treated as realising a capital gain or a capital loss equal to the difference between the cost base of the BRL Shares and the market value of the Scrip Consideration on the Implementation Date and the Cash Consideration.
 
The cost base of the BRL Shares will generally be their cost of acquisition and any incidental costs of acquisition (such as brokerage and stamp duty).
 
Indexation and discount capital gains
 
If the BRL Shares were acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999 a BRL Shareholder who is an individual, a complying superannuation entity or the trustee of a trust may elect to adjust the cost of the BRL Shares to include indexation by reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index from the calendar quarter in which the BRL Shares were acquired until the quarter ended 30 September 1999.
 
BRL Shareholders which are companies will be entitled to that indexation adjustment without making an election if their BRL Shares were acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999.
 
Indexation adjustments are taken into account only for the purposes of calculating any capital gain. They cannot be taken into account for the purposes of calculating any capital loss.
 
/%.
BRL Shareholders who are individuals, complying superannuation entities or trustees and who do not or cannot elect to adjust their cost base for indexation (as outlined above) can discount the amount of their net capital gain if they have held their BRL Shares for more than 12 months before the Implementation Date (referred to as the ""). For individuals and trustees the discount rate is 50% and for complying superannuation entities the rate is 33
CGT Discount

BRL Shareholders which are companies do not qualify for a CGT Discount.
Constellation CDIs
 
As outlined in Section 1.2, BRL Shareholders may receive Constellation CDIs.  This does not affect the income or CGT consequences outlined in this Section.
 
(c)           Dividends on the Scrip Consideration
 
Australian tax consequences
 
BRL Shareholders to whom this summary applies who receive Scrip Consideration as a result of the Scheme will have to include in their income for Australian income tax purposes, an amount equal to any dividend paid on the Scrip Consideration (including the United States withholding tax paid in respect of such dividends as described below). Generally, any United States withholding tax will be allowed as a credit to offset any Australian income tax on the dividend received.
 
Dividends payable in respect of the Scrip Consideration will not be franked and a holder of Scrip Consideration will not be entitled to a tax offset or franking credit for Australian income tax purposes.
 
Holders of Scrip Consideration will need to convert the dividends from US dollars into Australian dollars. If dividend payments are received and remitted to Australia in the same income tax year, this may be completed using the telegraphic transfer buying exchange rate published by any trading bank for the day of receipt. In other cases, (e.g., the dividends are remitted to a bank account outside of Australia), holders of Scrip Consideration will generally need to convert using the telegraphic transfer buying exchange rate published by any trading bank for the last day of the income tax year.
 
U.S. Tax Consequences
 
Dividends paid to a BRL Shareholder with respect to Scrip Consideration generally will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividend is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the BRL Shareholder in the United States.  In order to claim the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a BRL Shareholder may have to file with Constellation or its paying agent an exemption certificate or letter in accordance with the terms of such treaty.  Furthermore, under current regulations, a BRL Shareholder, including in certain cases of BRL Shareholders that are entities, the owner or owners of such entities, will be required to satisfy certain certification requirements in order to claim a reduced rate of withholding under an applicable income tax treaty. Generally, under the U.S.-Australia Tax Convention, the U.S. withholding tax rate on dividends paid by a U.S. corporation to a resident of Australia is reduced to 15%.
 
Dividends which are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment are generally subject to tax on a net income basis at rates applicable to U.S. citizens, resident aliens, and domestic United States corporations and are generally not subject to withholding.  Any such dividends received by a BRL Shareholder that is a corporation may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
 
(d)           Disposal of Scrip Consideration
 
Australian tax consequences
 
BRL Shareholders to whom this summary applies who receive Scrip Consideration as a result of the Share Scheme will be subject to Australian CGT on the sale or other disposal of their Scrip Consideration.
 
Generally, such holders of Scrip Consideration will realise a capital gain or capital loss equal to the difference between the cost base of their Scrip Consideration and the consideration received for such sale or other disposal.
 
If the BRL Shareholder chose roll-over relief, the cost base of the Scrip Consideration will be equal to a proportion of the cost base of the BRL Shares. In particular, for BRL Shareholders who receive a combination of Scrip Consideration and cash, as mentioned above, the cost base of the BRL Shares is required to be reasonably apportioned to determine the amount of capital gain attributable to the cash component. Consequently, the remaining proportion of the cost base (that was not apportioned to the cash component) will become the cost base of the Scrip Consideration. For the purpose of calculating the 12-month holding period in relation to the CGT Discount, the holder of Scrip Consideration (who acquired such shares as a result of the Share Scheme) will be treated as acquiring its Scrip Consideration at the same time as it acquired its BRL Shares.
 
If the BRL Shareholder did not choose roll-over relief, the cost base of the Scrip Consideration will be equal generally to the consideration provided by the BRL Shareholder for the acquisition of its Scrip Consideration. Broadly, this should equal the market value of the BRL Shares as at the Implementation Date, less the cash component.
 
U.S. tax consequences
 
A BRL Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of Scrip Consideration unless:
 
(i)    such gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the BRL Shareholder in the United States;
 
(ii)   the BRL Shareholder is an individual who holds such Scrip Consideration as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the disposition (and certain other conditions are satisfied); or
(iii)  A.  Constellation is or has been a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition, or, if shorter, the period during which the non-U.S. holder held the Scrip Consideration; and
 
B.   the BRL Shareholder is a greater than 5% holder of Scrip Consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Constellation believes that it has not been, is not currently and, based upon its current business plans, is not likely to become, a U.S. real property holding corporation.
 
If a BRL Shareholder that is a corporation is covered by clause (i) above, the net gain from a sale or disposition of the Scrip Consideration may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional "branch profits tax" at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
 
(e)           Foreign Investment Fund
 
Generally, under the Foreign Investment Fund () regime, interests in foreign companies can be taxed on an accruals basis (rather than a realisation basis).
"FIF"
 
The FIF rules will not apply to BRL Shareholders who acquire Scrip Consideration as a result of the Share Scheme on the basis that Constellation satisfies the "US entity" exemption contained in the FIF regime.
 
(f)            Stamp Duty
 
No Australian stamp duty will be payable as a consequence of accepting the Share Scheme.
 
10.2       
Tax Considerations for Share Scheme: United States holders
 
The following general discussion summarizes the anticipated material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of BRL Shares that exchange BRL Shares for Scrip Consideration, cash, or any combination of Scrip Consideration and cash pursuant to the Share Scheme.  The following general discussion does not address U.S. state tax consequences to U.S. holders of BRL Shares.  As used herein, the term "U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of BRL Shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof (including the District of Columbia); (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and if one or more U.S. persons has the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
 
The sale or exchange of BRL Shares pursuant to the Share Scheme will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As such, a U.S. holder of BRL Shares will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the Scrip Consideration and cash received pursuant to the Share Scheme, and (ii) such U.S. holder's basis in the BRL Shares exchanged therefor. Gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of BRL Shares (i.e., BRL Shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction).  If the BRL Shares exchanged constitute capital assets in the hands of the U.S. holder, gain or loss will be capital gain or loss.  In general, capital gains recognized by an individual will be subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20% if the BRL Shares were held for more than one year on the Implementation Date. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.  The Scrip Consideration received by a U.S. holder in exchange for BRL Shares pursuant to the Share Scheme will generally have a tax basis equal to the fair market value of the Scrip Consideration on the Implementation Date, and a new holding period beginning on the day following the Implementation Date.
 
In the case of a U.S. holder receiving Australian dollars, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount realized will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the Australian dollars received on the date such payment is included in income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A U.S. holder will generally be required to recognize ordinary income or loss upon a subsequent sale or disposition of such Australian dollars.
 
10.3       
Tax Considerations for Option Scheme
 
(a)           Introduction
 
The following is a general description of the Australian income and CGT consequences to BRL Option Holders of the Option Scheme.  The following description is based upon the law in effect at the date of this Scheme Booklet, but it is not intended to be an authoritative or complete statement of the law applicable to the particular circumstances of every BRL Option Holder.
 
You should seek independent professional advice in relation to your own particular circumstances.
 
The following summary is intended only for individual BRL Option Holders resident in Australia for income tax purposes.  If you are not resident in Australia for tax purposes you should take into account the tax consequences under the laws of your country of residence, as well as under Australian law, of acceptance of the Option Scheme.  This summary only applies to those BRL Option Holders who received their BRL Options in respect of their employment.
 
An Option holder's capital gains and capital losses from all sources recognised in an income year are aggregated to determine whether there is a net capital gain or net capital loss. The net capital gain (if any) is included in assessable income and is subject to income tax. Net capital losses may be
carried forward indefinitely and set against future capital gains. However, net capital losses cannot be offset against any other income.
 
The comments set out below are relevant only to those BRL Option Holders who hold their BRL Options as capital assets for the purpose of investment.
 
(b)           Cancellation of BRL Options - Income tax implications
 
The tax legislation applies a specific regime to all options granted to employees (or their associates) in respect of their employment: Division 13A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.  In general terms, the employees are subject to tax under Division 13A on the market value of the BRL Options or underlying shares at the relevant time, less any consideration paid by the employee.
 
In terms of the Options acquired pursuant to the Employee Option Plan applying both pre and post 1 October 2001, the Options are "qualifying rights" and the taxing point will be deferred until the earliest of when the Option is exercised, or disposed of, or when the employee ceases to be employed by the relevant company, or after 10 years.  Notwithstanding this, an employee may still elect for the Options to be taxed at the time of acquisition.
 
However, the cancellation of Options will mean that that Option Holders will be treated as though they never acquired Options pursuant to Division 13A.  Accordingly, the Option Scheme will result in no income tax liability for Option Holders under Division 13A.
 
Where an employee has made a written election to be taxed upon acquisition of the Options, any tax paid in this respect may be able to be refunded by amendment of the applicable income tax return. Where the Options were granted to an associate of the employee and an election was made to be taxed on acquisition, the cancellation of the Options will not affect this previous tax treatment. That is unlike when employees acquire their Options prior year income tax returns cannot be amended by employees to seek a refund of the amount of tax paid. However, the market value of the Options when acquired will be included in the CGT cost base of the Options.
 
(c)           Cancellation of BRL Options - Capital Gain or Loss
 
The cancellation of the Options will constitute a CGT event for Australian CGT purposes.
 
If you are an Australian resident you may make a capital gain or a capital loss, depending on whether your capital proceeds received for the cancellation of the Options are more than the cost base (or in some cases indexed cost base) of those Options (in which case a capital gain would arise), or whether the capital proceeds are less than the reduced cost base of those Options (in which case a capital loss would arise).
 
 
The capital proceeds of the CGT event will be the cash received by the Option Holder in respect of the cancellation of Options.
 
Indexation and discount capital gains
 
If the Options were acquired at or before 11.45 am on 21 September 1999, an Option Holder may elect to adjust the cost of the Options to include indexation by reference to changes in the Consumer Price Index from the calendar quarter in which the Options were acquired until the quarter ended 30 September 1999.
 
Indexation adjustments are taken into account only for the purposes of calculating any capital gain. They cannot be taken into account for the purposes of calculating any capital loss.
 
Option Holders who do not or cannot elect to adjust their cost base for indexation (as outlined above) can discount the amount of their net capital gain if they have held their Options for more than 12 months before the Implementation Date (referred to as the ""). The discount rate is 50%.

BRL Hardy and Constellation have agreed that within one month after the date of the Implementation Deed, BRL Hardy will make an offer to each holder of NonExecutive Options to cancel the Non-Executive Options held by that person in consideration of $2.42 in cash per Non-Executive Option. 
 
(d)           Employment arrangements with Messrs. Millar, Kennedy and Woods
 
Constellation have agreed that with effect from the Implementation Date:
BRL Hardy and
 
(i)    BRL Hardy will use its best endeavours to procure that BRL Hardy enters into supplementary employment agreements with Stephen Millar, Angus Kennedy and David Woods; and
 
(ii)   Messrs. Millar, Kennedy and Woods will be provided with certain Constellation stock options, on the terms set out in clause 8.5 of the Implementation Deed. BRL Hardy and Constellation have also agreed that Mr Millar will be entitled to participate in Constellation's management incentive plan on the terms set out in clause 8.5 of the Implementation Deed.
 
(e)           Director's payments and benefits
 
The six existing non-executive directors of BRL Hardy will be asked to retire if the Share Scheme is implemented. They are entitled to receive an amount on retirement under their existing appointment terms, calculated in accordance with the following formula: the lesser of
 
(i)    RB = total remuneration for three years immediately before the resignation; or
 
(ii)   RB = AAE x YOS x 35%
 
where
 
RB            is the retirement benefit;
 
AAE        is the Average Annual Emolument for three years immediately before the resignation;
 
YOS         is years of service.
 
Provided that if a non-executive director resigns at the request of a shareholder having effective voting control of the company (as is the case in this Merger), the minimum retirement amount is equal to the director's total emoluments during the three years ending on the date of retirement.
 
This will result in payments to each of the six non-executive directors ranging from approximately $193,000 to $506,000. The aggregate of the payments to be made to non-executive directors is approximately $1,690,000.
(f)            Constellation marketable securities

The table below is an extract from BRL Hardy's register of substantial shareholders, showing the shareholders, the number of equity securities in which they have a relevant interest and the voting power represented by those securities as disclosed by notices received by BRL Hardy under Part 6.7 of the Corporations Act and the date of the most recent notice.
 
 
Interests of Constellation and Constellation Australia
 
As at the date of this Scheme Booklet, neither Constellation nor Constellation Australia has any relevant interest in any securities in BRL Hardy and therefore their respective voting power is 0%.
 
11.7       
Particulars of Dealings
 
(a)   Except as disclosed elsewhere in this Scheme Booklet, neither Constellation, Constellation Australia nor any associate of Constellation or Constellation Australia provided, or agreed to provide, consideration for any BRL Shares under any arrangement or agreement during the four months before the date of this Scheme Booklet.
 
(b)   Except as disclosed elsewhere in this Scheme Booklet, during the period of four months before the date of this Scheme Booklet, neither Constellation, Constellation Australia nor any associate of Constellation or Constellation Australia gave or offered to give or agreed to give a benefit to another person where the benefit was likely to induce the other person, or an associate, to:
 
(i)    vote in favour of the Share Scheme or the Option Scheme; or
 
(ii)   dispose of BRL Shares,
 
which benefit is not offered to all BRL Shareholders under the Share Scheme or the Option Scheme.
 
11.8       
FIRB Approval
 
The FATA regulates the acquisition of shares in certain Australian companies where the acquisition results in a foreign entity controlling the corporation or a change in the identity of the foreign controllers of the corporation.
 
Accordingly, as the acquisition of BRL Shares under the Share Scheme will result in Constellation, a foreign entity, controlling BRL Hardy, the Share Scheme is conditional upon the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia unconditionally stating that he has no objection under the Australian Federal Government's foreign investment policy or under the FATA to the acquisition of BRL Shares by Constellation Australia or such an acquisition being not otherwise in breach of that legislation.
 
Constellation Australia lodged an application with FIRB on 24 January 2003 and does not believe that there are any issues that will cause the Treasurer to object to the acquisition of BRL Shares by Constellation Australia. However, Constellation Australia cannot give any assurance as to the outcome of its application to FIRB.

11.12     
No solicitation letter and transaction compensation deed
 
(a)   No solicitation letter
 
The "no solicitation" letter dated 13 January 2003 between BRL Hardy and Constellation provides that between 13 January 2003 and the completion of the merger or the date on which the Implementation Deed is terminated whichever is the earlier:
 
      BRL Hardy must not solicit, encourage or invite, directly or indirectly any discussions or proposals, or initiate or continue any discussions or negotiations, in relation to, or which may reasonably be expected to lead to, an offer by a third party to acquire a relevant interest in more than 15% of BRL Hardy or a substantial part of the business or assets of BRL Hardy or certain other transactions involving BRL Hardy (a ";
 - 
Third Party Proposal")
 
      BRL Hardy will promptly advise Constellation of any approach, inquiry or proposal made to BRL Hardy, any attempt to initiate negotiations or discussions with BRL Hardy or any request for information from BRL Hardy which relates or may relate to a Third Party Proposal including the identity of the third party making the approach or request and the terms of any proposal put to BRL Hardy;
 - 
 
      if BRL Hardy receives a bona fide Third Party Proposal and the Board acting in good faith determines after consultation with its financial and legal advisers that the proposal is financially superior to the proposed transaction with Constellation and is reasonably capable of implementation, obtains a written legal opinion from Queens Counsel or Senior Counsel to the effect that complying with the restrictions in the no solicitation letter would prevent the Board from discharging their fiduciary or statutory duties and provides a copy of that opinion to Constellation, BRL Hardy may engage in the activities which would otherwise be prohibited by the letter;
 - 
 
      BRL Hardy shall provide to Constellation a copy of any material that BRL Hardy provides to any third party in connection with a Third Party Proposal;
 - 
 
      if BRL Hardy receives a bona fide proposal to acquire all or the majority of the shares or assets of BRL Hardy and the BRL Board determines that the proposal is financially superior to the proposed Merger and is reasonably capable of implementation (a "") then prior to the BRL Board approving or recommending the Superior Proposal, Constellation shall have three Business Days to make a counterproposal.  If the BRL Board determines that Constellation's counterproposal is superior again to the Superior Proposal then BRL Hardy and Constellation must proceed with Constellation's counterproposal.  If Constellation does not make a counterproposal or its counterproposal is not superior to the Superior Proposal and BRL Hardy is required to pursue the Superior Proposal in order for the BRL Board to discharge its fiduciary or statutory duties, then BRL Hardy must announce to the ASX that the BRL Board recommends the Superior Proposal and shall be entitled to pursue that Superior Proposal.
 - 
Superior Proposal
 
(b) Transaction compensation deed
 
The deed dated 17 January 2003 between BRL Hardy and Constellation provides that Constellation must make the following compensation payments to BRL Hardy in the following circumstances:
 
      Constellation must pay BRL Hardy US$1,000,000 if any required competition authority and anti-trust approvals are not obtained before 8.00 am on the date of the Second Court Hearing or if shareholders do not approve the Merger due to Constellation failing to fulfil any of its obligations under the Implementation Deed or a material adverse change relating to the financial standing of Constellation;
 - 
 
      Constellation must pay to BRL Hardy US$500,000 if foreign investment approval in Australia is not obtained or if there is in effect any court order or other restraint preventing consummation of the Merger;
 - 
 
      Constellation must pay BRL Hardy US$1,300,000 if the Merger is not approved by the Court as a result of any financing condition to the Merger not being satisfied or if Constellation terminates the Implementation Deed under clause 12.1(c)(i) of that Deed;
 - 
 
The deed also provides that, on the basis of a representation by Constellation to BRL Hardy of its estimate of Constellation's transaction costs, BRL Hardy must pay Constellation compensation in the amount of US$10,000,000 if:
 
      a majority of the BRL Board withdraws or changes the recommendation given by the BRL Board in accordance with the Implementation Deed other than due to a material adverse change to the financial standing of Constellation;
 - 
 
      enters into, recommends or supports a third party proposal (being an offer to acquire more than 15% of BRL Hardy, an offer to acquire a substantial part of the business or assets of BRL, or an offer to amalgamate or merge with BRL Hardy, or BRL Hardy issues a material amount of share capital or implements any reorganisation, recapitalisation or dissolution);
 - 
 
      before the Second Court Hearing a third party announces a proposal which attributes a higher value to BRL Hardy than the Merger and within 12 months after announcement that person acquires an interest in at least 50% of BRL Hardy or otherwise acquires control of BRL Hardy or a substantial part of the business and assets of BRL Hardy;
 - 
 
      the shareholder meeting to approve the schemes is not convened due to BRL Hardy's failure to fulfil any of its obligations under Implementation Deed; or
 - 
 
      the transaction is not approved by the Court, due to BRL Hardy's failure to fulfil any obligations under the Implementation Deed.
 - 
 
BRL Hardy is not required to make payment of US$10,000,000 to Constellation if the Court does not approve the Merger because:
 
      before 8.00 am on the date of the Second Court Hearing, the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the US antitrust legislation has not been terminated or has not expired or all other consents, approvals and filings under any foreign competition antitrust law, the absence of which would prohibit the consummation of the Merger have not been obtained or made; or
 - 
 
      the Merger is not approved by the necessary majority of BRL Shareholders for reasons of any failure of Constellation to fulfil any of its obligations under the Implementation Deed (including a withdrawal by Constellation from the Merger) or a material adverse change relating to the financial standing of Constellation.
 - 
 
As security for BRL Hardy's payment of the compensation under the deed, BRL Hardy will provide Constellation with an unconditional bank guarantee of US$10,000,000 upon the occurrence of:    
 
(i)    each of the conditions precedent to funding under the Credit Facilities being satisfied or waived;
 
(ii)   any person acquiring at least 15% in BRL Hardy; or
 
(iii)  third party proposal being announced which is supported by the BRL Board, or otherwise likely to be consummated.
 
The guarantee must give Constellation the unconditional right to call on the guarantee if BRL Hardy fails to comply with its payment obligations but provides that Constellation may not call on the guarantee if BRL Hardy disputes the obligation to make payment (except where a third party acquires at least 50% of BRL Hardy in which case the dispute mechanism is not available).   The term of the guarantee must be for 12 months from the date of the deed.
 
(c)   Directors' Reasons
 
The Directors' reasons for entering into the no solicitation letter and the transaction compensation deed included:
 
      Constellation was prepared to make a proposal to acquire the shares in BRL Hardy only if it received the full support of the Directors and BRL Hardy's management;
 - 
 
      the no solicitation letter contained appropriate provisions to allow the Directors to discharge their fiduciary duties if an alternate bid for BRL Hardy was made;
 - 
 
      the transaction compensation deed afforded protection to BRL Hardy for costs incurred by it;
 - 
 
      the amount of compensation provided for in the transaction compensation deed, while significant, was not such as to deter an alternate bidder and was likely to reflect actual costs incurred by Constellation; and
 - 
 
      if a proposal was to be made, the proposal would be of substantial benefit to BRL Shareholders having regard to the share price of BRL Shares in the last several months and the current general share market conditions.
 - 
 
11.13     
No unacceptable circumstances
 
The Directors believe that the Merger does not involve any circumstances in relation to the affairs of any member of BRL Hardy that could reasonably be characterised as constituting "unacceptable circumstances" for the purposes of section 657A of the Corporations Act.
 
11.14     
Quotation of Constellation Shares and Constellation CDIs
 
As of 31 January 2003, NYSE approved the listing on the NYSE of the Constellation Shares to be issued pursuant to the Share Scheme subject to official notice of issuance.
 
Within 7 days after the date of this Scheme Booklet, Constellation Australia will cause an application to be made by Constellation for the admission to quotation of Constellation CDIs to be issued pursuant to the Share Scheme on the ASX.  Constellation has no reason to believe that the Constellation CDIs will not be listed by ASX.
 
11.15     
ASIC Relief and ASX Waivers
 
BRL Hardy has been granted an exemption by ASIC from the requirements to include certain information in relation to creditors schemes of arrangement as required by Sections 411(3)(b) and 412(1)(a)(ii) of the Corporations Act and Regulation 5.1.01(1)(a) and Part 2, Schedule 8 of the Corporations Regulations.
 
Constellation has applied to ASIC for a class order modification of Division 4 of Part 7.11 of the Corporations Act to apply that Division to Constellation CDIs.
 
BRL Hardy has obtained from ASX a waiver of Listing Rule 6.23.2 in connection with the cancellation of the Options (pursuant to the Option Scheme) and the Non-Executive Options which would otherwise require the approval of the BRL Shareholders in general meeting.  The waiver was obtained on 29 January 2003.
 
BRL Hardy has obtained from ASX a waiver of Listing Rule 7.40 in order to allow the Record Date to be six Business Days after the Effective Date instead of five Business Days as required under the timetable in Appendix 7A.
 
11.16     
Other Material Information
 
Otherwise than as contained or referred to in this Scheme Booklet, there is no other information material to the making of a decision by:
 
      a BRL Shareholder whether or not to vote in favour of the Share Scheme; or
 - 
 
      an Option Holder whether or not to vote in favour of the Option Scheme,
 - 
 
being information that is known to BRL Hardy and which has not previously been disclosed to BRL Shareholders and Option Holders (as the case may be).
 
On and from 5 December 2002 until the execution of the Implementation Deed, Constellation was given access by BRL Hardy and undertook due diligence in relation to certain information concerning BRL Hardy which has not been disclosed generally to BRL Shareholders.  The due diligence was conducted after the execution by Constellation of a confidentiality agreement with BRL Hardy in relation to the information disclosed to Constellation.  In addition BRL Hardy provided a legal and compliance report to Constellation as referred to in Schedule 1 of the Implementation Deed.
 
11.17

5.7          Fractional entitlements
 
If a fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share arises from the calculation of the Scheme Consideration in respect of a Scheme Shareholder, then any such fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of New Constellation Shares, as the case may be, and all fractional entitlements will be paid in the form of Cash Consideration.

Dear Directors
 
PROPOSED SCHEMES OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN BRL HARDY LIMITED AND CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC.
 
1.
                                     
Introduction
 
On 17 January 2003 BRL Hardy Limited ("BRL" or "the Company") and Constellation Brands, Inc. ("Constellation") announced that they had entered into an Implementation Deed ("ID") to merge the respective companies through two schemes of arrangement pursuant to Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 ("the Corporations Act").
 
Under the merger proposal:
 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation will acquire all of the shares in BRL ("BRL Shares") by way of scheme of arrangement ("Share Scheme"); and
 - 
                                         
 
all of the options over BRL Shares ("Options") granted pursuant to the BRL Employee Option Plan ("Employee Option Plan") will be cancelled by way of scheme of arrangement ("Option Scheme").
 - 
                                         
 
The Share Scheme and the Option Scheme are jointly referred to as "the Proposed Schemes".
 
Pursuant to the Share Scheme, the consideration offered to shareholders in BRL ("BRL Shareholders") for each share in BRL is:
 
cash of $10.50 per share ("Cash Consideration"); or
 - 
                                         
 
Constellation Shares ("Scrip Consideration") as outlined in detail in the Explanatory Statement; or
 - 
                                         
 
any combination of Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration.
 - 
                                         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The liability of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, is limited by, and to the extent of, the Accountants' Scheme under the Professional Standards Act 1994 (NSW).
Pursuant to the Option Scheme, the consideration offered to BRL optionholders ("BRL Optionholders or Optionholders") for each Option is:
 
a cash amount equal to the difference between $10.50 and the exercise price of the Option; and
 - 
                                        
 
an additional cash amount of $0.12 for Options on issue as at 19 September 2001.
 - 
                                        
 
If the Share Scheme is approved, BRL will become wholly owned by Constellation and will be delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange Limited ("ASX").  The Option Scheme, which is conditional upon the approval of the Share Scheme, if approved, will result in the Options being cancelled.  The Share Scheme and the Option Scheme must be approved by the requisite majority of BRL Shareholders and Optionholders.
 
The detailed terms of the Proposed Schemes are set out in the Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting.  An overview of the Proposed Schemes is set out in Section 1 of this report.
 
2.
                                     
Purpose of report
 
The directors of BRL have engaged Deloitte Corporate Finance Pty Limited ("Deloitte Corporate Finance") to prepare an independent expert's report in relation to the Proposed Schemes to express an opinion as to whether or not:
 
the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders as a whole; and
 - 
                                         
 
the Option Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Optionholders as a whole.
 - 
                                         
 
Notwithstanding that an independent expert's report is not required pursuant to the Corporations Law, we have prepared this report, having regard to Section 411 of the Corporations Law and the relevant ASIC Policy Statements and Practice Notes.
 
This report is to be included in the Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting to be sent to BRL Shareholders and Optionholders and has been prepared for the exclusive purpose of assisting BRL Shareholders and Optionholders in their consideration of the Proposed Schemes.  This report cannot and should not be used for any other purpose.
 
3.
                                     
Basis of evaluation
 
In assessing whether the Proposed Schemes are in the best interest of the BRL Shareholders and Optionholders as a whole, we have had regard to the fairness and reasonableness of the Proposed Schemes, namely:
 
estimated the fair market value of an ordinary share in BRL and compared that value with the consideration to be received by the BRL Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme;
 - 
                                         
 
estimated the fair market value of each series of Options included in the Option Scheme and compared those values with the consideration to be received by the BRL Optionholders, for each series of options; and
 - 
                                         
compared the advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes for both Shareholders and Optionholders and considered whether the likely advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes proceeding outweigh the likely advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes not proceeding.
 - 
                                         
 
In our assessment of "best interest" we have considered the likely impact of the Proposed Schemes on the Shareholders and Optionholders as a whole.
 
4.
                                     
Summary Opinion
 
In our opinion, in the absence of a higher offer:
 
the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders as a whole; and
 - 
                                         
 
the Option Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Optionholders as a whole
 - 
                                         
.
 
We have based this opinion on the analysis contained in our report which is summarised below.
 
5.
                                     
Share Scheme
 
In determining whether the Share Scheme is in the best interest of the BRL Shareholders, we have considered both the Cash Consideration and the Scrip Consideration, having regard to fairness and reasonableness.
 
Fairness
 
Cash Consideration
 
In our opinion, the Cash Consideration is fair.
 
This opinion was based on the following:
 
the Cash Consideration is within our estimated fair market value range for a BRL Share on a control basis; and
 - 
                                         
 
theCash Consideration represents a significant premium over and above the recent share market price of BRL Shares.
 - 
                                         
 
Set out in the table below is a comparison of our assessment of the fair market value of a BRL share, recent BRL share market trading data and the Cash Consideration being offered pursuant to the Share Scheme.
 
 
Notes:
(1)
Volume weighted average price two months prior to 13 January 2003.
(2)
Closing price 13 January 2003.
 
Valuation of a BRL Share
 
We have estimated the fair market value of a BRL Share using the capitalisation of maintainable earnings method.  We have also conducted an analysis of recent share trading in BRL Shares as a cross-check to our valuation.
 
We have estimated the fair market value of a BRL Share to be in the range of $9.76 to $10.77 inclusive of a premium for control.  In selecting our valuation range, we have taken account of the following factors:
 
the historical and forecast performance of BRL and the factors which may impact on its future growth and profitability;
 - 
                                         
 
the share market earnings multiples of comparable publicly traded companies which operate in a similar environment both domestically and internationally; and
 - 
                                         
 
the valuation multiples implied by recent takeover transactions in the Australian wine sector.
 - 
                                         
 
The table below summarises our assumptions and valuation conclusions.
 
 
 
Note: Information regarding the number of shares on issue was dated 23 December 2002.
 
Scrip Consideration
 
The number and value of Constellation shares to be issued to BRL Shareholders accepting the Scrip Consideration in whole or in part will not be determined until after the date of this report and after the BRL Shareholders have approved the Share Scheme.
 
The number and value of Constellation shares, which BRL Shareholders will receive will depend on the average Constellation share price and the average exchange rate during the period leading up to the Second Court Hearing.
 
If the average Constellation Share price leading up to the Second Court Hearing falls between US$22.50 and US$27.50, the BRL Shareholders will receive Constellation Shares with an equivalent value of $10.50 calculated as at that date.
 
If the average Constellation Share price is above US$27.50 or below US$22.50, BRL Shareholders will receive Constellation Shares with an equivalent value that may be above or below $10.50.  It is therefore not possible to compare in certain circumstances our assessment of the value of a BRL Share with the value of the Scrip Consideration.
 
Based on our analysis of recent share market trading activity, the market value of Constellation Class A Shares prior to the announcement of the transaction was in the range of US$23 to US$26.
Our analysis indicates that Constellation Shares have traded at a discount in the order of 5% to 15% compared to the S&P 500 index and other comparable US companies in the wine and beverage sector. In assessing the value of the Scrip Consideration, BRL Shareholders will need to consider the share market price of Constellation Class A Shares at the time they vote on the Share Scheme.  This share market price will reflect market conditions at that time including the share market's assessment of the proposed acquisition of BRL and any subsequent information released to the market by both Constellation and BRL.  Based on that assessment, BRL Shareholders will need to consider if they wish to elect to receive the Cash Consideration or the Scrip Consideration.  The election must be made within 15 days of the Share Scheme Meeting (per the proposed timetable).
 
Reasonableness
 
In forming our opinion we have also considered the following likely advantages and disadvantages to BRL Shareholders if the Share Scheme proceeds and the likely advantages and disadvantages if the Share Scheme does not proceed.
 
If the Share Scheme proceeds
 
Advantages
 
The consideration offered is flexible, offering a choice between cash and Constellation Shares, allowing BRL Shareholders to elect the type of consideration which best suits their individual circumstances.
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders electing the Cash Consideration are able to dispose of their BRL Shares at a price which significantly exceeds the recent BRL share trading range on the ASX. The opportunity to realise this value may not be otherwise available for some time.  The Cash Consideration option provides BRL shareholders with certainty over the value of the consideration to be received.
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration will be able to participate in the future growth of Constellation which will be a leading international wine company and a significant global diversified alcohol group with a significant presence in the US, UK and Australian markets.
 - 
                                         
 
The proposed merger may deliver operational synergies and cost savings that may enhance the operational and financial performance of the business and may add value to Constellation shares over time.  However, the realisation of these potential synergies will be dependent upon management's ability to successfully integrate two companies.
 - 
                                         
 
Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration may benefit from capital gains tax roll-over provisions.
 - 
                                         
 
Disadvantages
 
BRL Shareholders will no longer collectively control BRL or hold a direct interest in the Company.  BRL Shareholders will no longer be able to directly participate in the future growth of BRL to the extent that it may generate a future value above the Share Scheme consideration.
 - 
                                         
 
Electing the Cash Consideration pursuant to the Share Scheme may crystallise income tax liabilities for individual shareholders.
 - 
                                         
For Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration:
 
              in certain circumstances, the Australian dollar value of the Scrip Consideration will not be determinable until after the date the Shareholders meet to vote on the Proposed Schemes.  BRL Shareholders can make their election to take scrip once this information is made available by BRL;
 - 
 
BRL Shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the market value of the Constellation Shares and the US$/A$ exchange rate between the date the CDI entitlement is calculated and the date the CDI's are actually received (9 days based on the proposed transaction timetable);
 - 
                                         
 
Constellation's total debt will increase significantly following the proposed merger.  The ratio of total debt to book equity ratio will increase from 1.2 up to 2.5;
 - 
                                         
 
the risk exists that there may be relatively lower liquidity in the trading of Constellation CDI's on the ASX (compared to BRL Shares) and a risk they may trade at a discount to the underlying Constellation share price;
 - 
                                         
 
BRL is predominantly a wine company whilst the merged entity will have a significantly different business profile. Shareholders will face different investment risks and returns compared to their existing shareholding;
 - 
                                         
 
Constellation does not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future;
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders will have a different level of control and voting power. Constellation is effectively controlled by the Sands family; and
 - 
                                         
 
              other considerations outlined in Section 11 of this report.
 - 
 
If the Share Scheme is NOT approved
 
Advantages
 
The BRL Shareholders will continue to collectively control BRL.
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shares will remain listed on the ASX and the company will continue to pursue its business strategy in accordance with its stated objectives. Shareholders will be entitled to any benefits including dividends and share value growth derived from the ongoing activities.
 - 
                                         
 
Disadvantages
 
BRL Shareholders will not receive the consideration offered in the Share Scheme.
 - 
                                         
 
BRL's share price which has increased following the announcement of the Share Scheme, is likely to decline if the Share Scheme is not approved.
 - 
                                         
 
BRL's future outlook may be less favourable than the Combined Entity's future outlook due to the potential synergies and other strategic benefits that might have arisen in the Combined Entity, which will not be realised if the Proposed Scheme does not proceed.
 - 
                                         
6.             Option Scheme
Fairness
 
In our opinion, the Option Scheme is fair to the Optionholders as a whole.
Our opinion is based on the following:
 
the Option Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium over the estimated market value of each option (except for the options at an exercise price of $10.13);
 - 
                                         
 
the majority of the holders of Options with an exercise price of $10.13 hold a portfolio of Options which results in the value of the Option Consideration exceeding the assessed fair market value of the portfolio of Options held; and
 - 
                                         
 
the Optionholders who hold options with an exercise price of $10.13 and no other options only hold approximately 2.5% of this series of options.
 - 
                                         
 
We have valued each option utilising the Black-Scholes option pricing model and applied a discount for the lack of marketability where appropriate.  The table below summarises our valuation conclusion in respect of the Option Scheme.
 
 
 
Reasonableness
 
In our opinion, the Option Scheme is reasonable for the Optionholders as a whole.
 
In reaching our opinion, we have considered the likely advantages and disadvantages for Optionholders as outlined below.
If the Option Scheme is approved
 
Advantages
 
Optionholders will be able to dispose of their Options.  As the Scheme Options are neither listed on a stock exchange nor assignable or tradeable, Optionholders have limited opportunity to dispose of their options.
 - 
                                         
 
The Option Scheme provides certainty of value to be realised by the Optionholders and a significant premium above the assessed value per option (excluding those holding options with an exercise price of $10.13).
 - 
                                         
 
Disadvantages
 
Holders of the cancelled options will no longer have the opportunity to participate in the potential increase in BRL's share price above the implied premium for each series of options.
 - 
                                         
 
The Option Scheme may crystallise tax liabilities for individual Optionholders.
 - 
                                         
 
If the Option Scheme is NOT approved
 
Any tax liabilities will be deferred until the time the Optionholders choose to dispose of their options.
 - 
                                         
 
If the Shareholder Scheme is approved, BRL Shares will be delisted.  Accordingly, options would be convertible into a minority shareholding in an unlisted entity.  The market value of these shares would be highly uncertain because of their lack of liquidity.
 - 
                                         
 
Constellation will be in a position to compulsory acquire the unlisted options or BRL Shares that they would receive from exercising their options under chapter 6A of the Corporations Act.
 - 
                                         
 
              the Optionholders may miss the opportunity of obtaining a significant premium over the fair market value for their options.
 - 
 
Alternative Bidders
 
The Proposed Schemes were announced on 17 January 2003.  The Directors of BRL have confirmed that there have not been any alternative offers since this date and that they are not aware of any alternative offers that may be forthcoming.
 
If a superior alternative offer emerges prior to the meeting to approve the Proposed Schemes, BRL Shareholders will be able to vote against the Proposed Schemes.
Tax Considerations
 
An individual Shareholder and Optionholder's decision in relation to the Proposed Schemes may be influenced by their particular taxation and other circumstances.  Shareholders and Optionholders should refer to Section 10 of the Explanatory Statement and/or seek independent professional advice.
 
Our opinion should be read in conjunction with the full text of this report, which sets out our findings and scope.

THE PROPOSED SCHEMES
 
1.1         
Background
 
On 17 January 2003, BRL entered into an Implementation Deed with Constellation that will result in Constellation acquiring all the issued shares in BRL and cancelling all BRL employee options by way of the Proposed Schemes.  The Proposed Schemes require approval by the BRL Shareholders, BRL Optionholders and the Court.  Details of the Proposed Schemes are set out in the Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting.
 
1.2         
Overview of the Share Scheme
 
The Share Scheme provides for the acquisition by Constellation of all of the issued shares in BRL.
 
The key terms of the Share Scheme are summarised as follows:
 
the consideration offered to acquire each BRL Share is $10.50, to be satisfied in cash, Constellation Shares or any combination of cash and Constellation Shares at the election of each BRL Shareholder;
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders electing the Cash Consideration will receive $10.50;
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration in whole or part will receive entitlements to Constellation Shares;
 - 
                                         
 
Australian Shareholders of BRL electing the Scrip Consideration will receive their entitlement to Constellation Shares in the form of CHESS Depository Interests ("CDI's"). Each Constellation Share will equate to 10 Constellation CDI's (subject to ASX approval).  The Constellation CDI's will be listed and traded on the ASX;
 - 
                                         
 
US shareholders of BRL electing the Scrip Consideration will receive their entitlement to the form of Constellation Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE");
 - 
                                         
 
The number of Constellation Shares to be received if the Scrip Consideration is elected is calculated by applying the following formula:
 - 
                                         
 
Number of Constellation Shares =  C x $10.50 / P, where:
 
=    the average of the closing US$/A$exchange rate as quoted by Bloomberg (based on the New York market close at 5.30 pm New York time) for the last 10 days period prior to time which is 24 hours before the second Court hearing date in respect of the Share Scheme ("Second Court Hearing").
C
                   
 
=    is the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Constellation Shares in US$traded on the NYSE for the 10 full trading days period ending 24 hours prior to the Second Court Hearing provided that:
P
                    
 
(a)                 if the VWAP is below US$22.50, P is US$22.50; and
 
(b)                 if VWAP is above US$27.50, P is US$27.50.
BRL Shareholders who do not made an election to participate in the Scrip Consideration will receive the Cash Consideration in respect of their shares.
 - 
                                         
 
In the event the Share Scheme is approved BRL Shareholders will be able to make their election to receive the Cash Consideration or the Scrip Consideration within 15 days of the Share Scheme Meeting (based on the Proposed Transactions timetable).
 - 
                                         
 
A detailed description of the Share Scheme is provided in the Explanatory Statement.
 
1.2.1       Approval of the Share Scheme
 
The Share Scheme will need to be approved at a meeting of BRL Shareholders.  Approval of the Share Scheme requires more than 50% of BRL Shareholders who vote at the meeting to vote in favour of the proposed resolutions.  The BRL Shareholders voting in favour must also hold at least 75% of the shares voted at the Share Scheme Meeting. Implementation of the Share Scheme is subject to approval by the Court.
 
1.3         
Overview of the Option Scheme
 
BRL and Constellation have agreed to execute the necessary documents to give effect to the Option Scheme.
 
The Option Scheme will result in all the options issued pursuant to the Employee Option Plan being cancelled.  As consideration for the cancellation of the Scheme Options, Constellation will pay Scheme Optionholders, a cash amount equal to the difference between $10.50 and the exercise price of each option.
 
The amount of $10.50 is equal to the Cash Consideration that Constellation is offering BRL Shareholders for each BRL Share under the Share Scheme.
 
For Options on issue as at 19 September 2001 and still unexercised Optionholders will receive an additional cash amount of $0.12, reflecting the value of additional share entitlements accruing under the Employee Option Plan as a result of the rights issue announced on that date.
 
A detailed description of the Option Scheme is provided in the Explanatory Statement.
 
1.3.1 Approval and implementation of the Option Scheme
 
The Option Scheme will need to be approved at a meeting of BRL Optionholders.  Approval of the Option Scheme requires more than 50% of the BRL Optionholders who vote at the Option Scheme Meeting to vote in favour of the proposed resolutions.  The Optionholders voting in favour must also hold at least 75% of the options voted at the Option Scheme Meeting.
 
Implementation of the Option Scheme is subject to approval of the Share Scheme by BRL Shareholders and by the Court.  In the event that the Option Scheme is not approved by the Optionholders and the Share Scheme is approved the Share Scheme will proceed.
1.3.2       Potential outcomes
 
The alternative outcomes are detailed below:
 
Share Scheme is approved and the Option Scheme approved
 
If both the Share Scheme and the Option Scheme are approved and all other conditions precedent satisfied, then:
 
BRL will become wholly owned by Constellation and will be de-listed from the ASX;
 - 
                                         
 
BRL Shareholders will be entitled to receive cash or entitlements to Constellation shares or a combination of both;
 - 
                                         
 
all the Scheme Options and associated rights and entitlements will be cancelled; and
 - 
                                         
 
each Optionholder will receive the Option Scheme Consideration.
 - 
                                         
 
Share Scheme is approved and the Option Scheme is not approved
 
If the Share Scheme is approved and all other conditions satisfied and the Option Scheme is not approved:
 
BRL will become wholly owned by Constellation and will be de-listed from the ASX; and
 - 
                                         
 
the Options will not be cancelled and will continue in accordance with the terms of the Employee Option Plan.
 - 
                                         
 
Share Scheme is not approved
 
If the Share Scheme is not approved the Option Scheme will not be implemented.

SCOPE OF THE REPORT
 
2.1         
Purpose of the report
 
Deloitte Corporate Finance has been appointed by the directors of BRL as an independent expert to express an opinion as to whether or not the Proposed Schemes are in the best interest of the BRL Shareholders and Optionholders.
 
Section 411 of the Corporations Act regulates schemes of arrangements between a company and its members.  Part 3 of Schedule 8 of the Corporations Regulations 2001 prescribes the information to be sent to Shareholders and Optionholders in relation to schemes of arrangement.  Notwithstanding the absence of any specific regulatory requirement, the directors of BRL have requested Deloitte Corporate Finance to prepare this report to assist BRL Shareholders and Optionholders in their evaluation of the Proposed Schemes and to state whether or not, in their opinion, the schemes of arrangement are "in the best interest" of members.
 
This report is to be included in the Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting to be sent to BRL Shareholders and Optionholders and has been prepared for the exclusive purpose of assisting BRL Shareholders and Optionholders in their consideration of the Proposed Schemes.  This report cannot and should not be used for any other purpose.
 
The Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting contains considerable information in respect of the Proposed Schemes.  Where appropriate we have summarised the key terms of the Proposed Schemes or we have referred to appropriate sections in the Explanatory Statement in which the relevant particulars are contained.  We recommend all BRL Shareholders and Optionholders read the Explanatory Statement and Notice of Meeting in full.
 
2.2         
Basis of evaluation
 
There is no statutory or regulatory definition of the expression "in the best interest".  However, guidance is provided by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") Policy Statements and Practice Notes, which establish certain guidelines in respect of independent expert's reports required under the Corporations Act.  In particular, we have considered Policy Statements 75 and 142, Practice Note 43 and common market practice.
 
Policy Statement 142 requires an expert to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of a scheme in arriving at an overall view as to whether implementation of a scheme is "in the best interest" of the shareholders.
 
Policy Statement 75 states that what is fair and reasonable or "in the best interest" of the members in a proposed scheme, should include a comparison of the likely advantages and disadvantages for the relevant shareholders if the proposed scheme does or does not proceed. Comparing the value of the existing shares or options to the consideration receivable under the proposed scheme would be only one element of this assessment.
ASIC Policy Statement 75, also implies that if the scheme of arrangement is fair and reasonable it will be in the best interest of members.  Under Policy Statement 75, an offer is:
 
fair, when the value of the consideration is equal to or greater than the value of the securities subject to the scheme; and
 - 
                                         
 
reasonable, if it is fair, or despite not being fair, after considering other significant factors, shareholders should accept the offer under the scheme, in the absence of any higher bids.
 - 
                                         
 
In forming our opinion as to whether or not the Proposed Schemes are in the best interest of BRL Shareholders and Optionholders we have:
 
estimated the fair market value of the BRL Shares and compared that value with the consideration to be received by the BRL Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme;
 - 
                                         
 
estimated the fair market value of each series of Options and compared that value with the consideration to be received by the BRL Optionholders, for each series of options, pursuant to the Option Scheme; and
 - 
                                         
 
compared the advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes for both Shareholders and Optionholders and considered whether the likely advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes proceeding outweigh the likely advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes not proceeding.
 - 
                                         
 
2.3         
Shareholders/Optionholders as a whole
 
We have evaluated the Proposed Schemes for BRL Shareholders and Optionholders as a whole by assessing its overall impact on the BRL Shareholders and Optionholders rather than the impact of each element of the Proposed Schemes in isolation.
 
We have not considered the effect of the Proposed Schemes on the particular circumstances of individual BRL Shareholders and Optionholders.  Some individual BRL Shareholders and Optionholders may place a different emphasis on various aspects of the Proposed Schemes from the one adopted in this report. Accordingly, individuals may reach different conclusions on whether the Proposed Schemes are in their best interest.
 
An individual BRL Shareholder's and Optionholder's decision in relation to the Proposed Schemes may be influenced by their particular circumstances.  We recommend BRL Shareholders and Optionholders seek independent advice in their assessment of the Proposed Schemes.
2.4         
Definition of value
 
For the purposes of our opinion, fair market value is defined as the amount at which the shares or options would change hands between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller, neither being under a compulsion to buy or sell.
 
Fair market value, as defined above, is a concept of value, which may or may not equal the "purchase/sale price" that could be obtained if the shares were sold to a special purchaser in an actual transaction in the open market.  Special purchasers may be willing to pay higher prices to gain control or obtain the capacity to reduce or eliminate competition, ensure a source of material supply or sales, achieve cost savings arising on business combinations following acquisitions or other synergies which could be enjoyed by the purchaser.  Our valuation will not be premised on the existence of a special purchaser.
 
For the purposes of forming our fairness opinion, we have valued the BRL Shares on a control basis.
 
2.5         
Limitations and reliance on information
 
The opinion of Deloitte Corporate Finance is based on economic, market and other conditions prevailing at the date of this report.  Such conditions can change significantly over relatively short periods of time.  This report should be read in conjunction with the declarations outlined in Appendix 3.

PROFILE OF THE WINE INDUSTRY
 
3.1         
Australian wine industry
 
The Australian wine industry covers a range of activities including grape cultivation, wine processing and packaging, marketing and distribution to local and export markets.
 
Table 1 below gives an indication of the size of the different industry segments and their growth over recent years.
 
Table 1
 
 
 
Source: ABS Vineyard Survey, ABS Catalogue No. 1329.0, ABS Catalogue No. 8504.0, Australian Wine & Brandy Corporation Export Approval Database.
Note: n/a = not available at time of report.
 
The Australian wine industry has undergone significant growth in the last decade, which has predominantly been attributable to growth in export sales.  Along with volume increases, the quality of Australian wine exports has increased with a higher proportion of bottled wine sales and a lower proportion of bulk and cask wine exported.  The increase in demand for quality Australian wines combined with limited supply has contributed to improved prices and margins.
 
Other factors that have contributed to the industry growth include:
 
increasing incomes and rising living standards have helped raise per capita wine consumption;
 - 
                                         
 
changes in population demographics favouring the 40-64 age bracket, one of the largest wine consuming groups in Australia;
 - 
                                         
 
increasing restaurant patronage; and
 - 
                                         
 
growth in regional wine tourism and cellar door sales.
 - 
                                         
The demand for Australian wine is relatively price elastic, with the degree to which consumers respond to changing wine prices and consumer incomes differing between cask wines and premium table wines.  An ABARE study found cask wine consumers to be significantly more price sensitive relative to premium wine consumers.  The same ABARE study showed demand response to a change in income was estimated to be negative for cask wine but positive for premium wine.  Accordingly, the rising trend in real incomes could partially explain the increase in premium sales and decreases in cask sales.
 
3.2         
Australian domestic market
 
Domestic sales of Australian wine increased by 22% between 1992 and 2002, with virtually all of that growth coming in the last five years through increased domestic sales of Australian red wine.  White wine sales have remained relatively stable in this period.
 
Although domestic sales of Australian wine are dominated by white table wine, the majority of this wine is sold as relatively inexpensive cask wine.  Figure 1 below, highlights both the considerable growth in domestic sales of Australian red table wine and the dramatic increase in sales of higher quality bottled red wine, which surpassed sales of red cask wine in 1996.
 
Figure 1

3.3         
Australian export market
 
The 2002 year was an excellent year for Australian wine exports with sales of $2.3 billion.  In terms of volume, Australia's wine exports have grown from a base of just eight million litres in 1982 to 471 million litres in 2002.  Australian wine exports have grown at an average of 11% per annum over the last 5 years.
 
Exports as a percentage of total Australian wine produced have grown from just 3% of Australian Wine in 1982 to 20% in 1992 and 51% in 2002.  Although red wine currently dominates exports of Australian wine, this has traditionally not been the case. It was not until 2000 that exports of Australian red wine exceeded white wine, having accelerated considerably from the mid-1990s.
 
Figure 2

Exports of Australian wine are dominated by bottled wine making up some 80% of total Australian wine exports.  Figure 3 below, highlights that the growth in Australian wine exports has come almost entirely from exports of bottled wine.
Figure 3
 
 
Source: Australian Wine & Brandy Corporation Export Approval Database.
 
The figure below highlights the effect the growth in exports of premium bottled red wine has had on the pricing profile of Australia's wine exports. In 2002, approximately 40% of exported Australian wine was in the > $5.00 category, compared to just 20% in 1997.

Wine supply
 
Wine regions in Australia
 
At the conclusion of the 2002 harvest Australia had approximately 160,000 hectares under grapevines, double the area in 1996.  Of this total area, 89% is currently bearing grapes, a percentage that has increased significantly over the last six years as the significant plantings of the mid-1990s reach maturity.
 
From a regional perspective, Australia's vineyards are concentrated in South Australia, home to 43% of all vineyards in Australia, followed by Victoria (24%) and New South Wales (23%).  The top six grape producing regions in Australia as at 2001 are set out in Table 2 below.

South Australia dominates Australian wine exports being responsible for 75% of all Australian wine exports both in terms of volume and value.
 
Varieties and trends
 
In the early 1990s the Australian wine industry recognised that its future growth lay with the production of premium varieties and in particular the production of premium red wines given strong international demand for varietal brands.  Consequently red varieties now account for 61% of the total area under grapevines in Australia, with Shiraz being the most prolific variety in Australia, occupying 22% of Australia's total grape bearing area, followed by Cabernet Sauvignon (19%), Chardonnay (13%), Sultana (8%) and Merlot (6%).

Note:  Data not released for 2001-02.
 
The rise of red varieties in Australia has come at the expense of white varieties many of which were removed in the late 1990's and early 2000's.  Recognising the potential for this trend to create a supply imbalance plantings of white varieties for 2002 were forecast to increase by 8% to 2,227 hectares whilst plantings of red varieties were forecast to fall by over 39%, from 4,538 hectares to 2,749 hectares.
 
Driven by an increase in plantings in 1998 (refer Figure 6) and the resulting new wine now coming to market, the Australian wine industry is in the midst of a significant supply increase.

With recent plantings being dominated by red varieties a shortage of white wine particularly Chardonnay is emerging.
 
Oversupply
 
Falling grape prices and an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of unprocessed fruit during vintage 2002 have led to concerns of "oversupply" in the Australian wine industry.
 
Price declines in 2002 (and preceding two years) are highlighted as evidence that grape supply growth has outpaced demand growth over this period.  Allowing for the declines in 2000 and 2001, grape prices were still 70% higher in 2001 than in 1990.  By comparison, the consumer price index ("CPI") rose 32% over the same period.
 
Grape prices had benefited from a "shortage premium" throughout most of the 1990's, however, the significant increase in grape supply of the last few years has eroded that premium.  The grape price increases between 1991 and 1998 led to the wine grape-planting boom and since 1998, planting rates have declined along with grape prices.
 
Table 3 (Riverland, Sunraysia and the Riverina) and Table 4 (Barossa) indicate that any current over supply issues are likely to be overcome in the medium term.

Analysts have attempted to model the demand versus supply position for the Australian wine industry over the next three years.  The table below demonstrates that the oversupply is predominantly in red wine, with the total oversupply position (subject to domestic and export growth rates and climate conditions) expected to be significantly reduced by 2005.

The market dynamics that arise as a consequence of oversupply are:
 
              increased competition;
 - 
 
              risk of price discounting;
 - 
 
              increased promotional expenditure to secure shelf space;
 - 
 
              a build-up in inventory and net working capital; and
 - 
 
              a proliferation of new private label brands.

Key participants
 
While Australia has over 1,465 wineries, the wine crush is highly concentrated amongst a few large companies with the five largest wineries crushing some 68% of the total grapes crushed in 2001.
 
The next 15 medium-sized wineries such as McWilliams Wines, De Bortoli Wines, Cranswick Premium Wines, Riverina Estate and Miranda Wines account for approximately 27% of Australia's wine crush, with the remaining 5% shared amongst the other 1,445 small wineries.

Competitive position
 
Australia's competitive advantages in the global wine industry are supported by:
 
a proactive relationship with the market, product depth and diversity, commitment to distribution networks and focus on promotion which ensures Australian wines provide variety and value for money;
 - 
                                         
 
early adoption of innovative technology;
 - 
                                         
 
Australia compares favourably with Europe, Chile and California in terms of skilled viticulturists and winemakers; and
 - 
                                         
 
lower land costs, varying climatic conditions across the country, quality soils and moderate water availability has allowed Australian wine makers to produce an excellent varietal choice at all price points.  Australia's closest competitor in terms of physical supply factors is seen to be Chile.
 - 
                                         
 
While the international market for Australian wine is becoming more competitive, significant growth opportunities remain for the Australian wine industry.
3.7         
Future outlook for the Australian wine industry
 
The overall outlook for the Australian wine industry is positive with strong demand for Australian wine in overseas markets principally in the US and the UK.
 
The Australian wine industry has experienced significant growth over the last decade primarily due to:
 
strong growth in international demand for wine in the mid and upper retail price points (above US$5), in which most Australian wine falls; and
 - 
                                         
 
a strong commitment by Australian wineries to growing the profile of their brands internationally.
 - 
                                         
 
Wine consumption per capita has increased substantially over the past 30 years in markets like the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden and Finland (UK, Ireland, Denmark and Finland up 600%), whereas wine consumption in traditional markets (France, Spain, Argentina, Italy, Switzerland and Chile) has decreased.  Australian wineries have been successful in promoting their products to these new markets, particularly the UK.
 
Emerging pressures for Australian domestic wine industry
 
Recent trends in the Australian domestic wine industry pose a threat to sustained growth and the earnings prospects of participants.  These pressures include:
 
price pressure from the continuing consolidation of retail outlets;
 - 
                                         
 
intense competition in the domestic market over the past 12-18 months, leading to price cutting, a significant increase in domestic promotional activity and recent profit downgrades from some listed wine companies; and
 - 
                                         
 
the oversupply of premium red wine varieties leading to a build-up in inventories and net working capital resulting in price-cutting and increased promotional activity among producers attempting to reduce inventory.
 - 
                                         
 
Future wine sales
 
According to wine industry analysts, exports of Australian red wine are expected to grow in the region of 30% in 2003, 28% in 2004 and 26% in 2005, with exports of Australian white wine expected to grow by 18% in 2003, 15% in 2004 and 12% in 2005.  In contrast, the Australian domestic wine market is expected to remain relatively static, with consumption of red wine growing by 6% in 2003 and 2004 and 5% in 2005 and white wine growing by only 2% in 2003 and 2004 and just 1% in 2005.

Export markets
 
Australia's top five export markets are the UK, US, Canada, New Zealand and Germany, as shown below in Figure 8.

The graph above highlights the importance of the UK and US markets for Australian wine.  In terms of volume and value, the UK and the US together account for 71% of Australia's exported wine.  Although the UK accounts for 46% of Australia's exported wine by volume it accounts for a lower percentage (39%) by value.  In contrast, the US accounts for 32% of the value of Australia's wine exports (25% of volume) due to the significantly greater proportion of red wine exported to the US as compared to the UK.

US wine industry
 
3.9.1       The US  A growing wine market
 
By retail value, the US is the largest beverage market in the world, with total retail wine sales of US$19 billion in 2001.
Growth in the US wine market over the last decade has largely been driven by an increase in demand for table wine which accounted for over 85%of the total US wine market in 2001.  The increase in consumption of table wine is attributed to:
 
a growing appreciation of the potential health benefits of moderate red wine consumption;
 - 
                                         
 
the ageing population of the US; and
 - 
                                         
 
              increasing disposable incomes among consumers.
 - 
 
These three factors, taken together, have also driven the growth in the super-premium and ultra-premium US wine market over the last decade.  Much of this growth can be attributed to the shifts in preferences of the largest and wealthiest age segment of the US population.
 
From a low point of 140 million cases of table wine consumed in 1991 consumption of table wine in the US has grown every year to reach 208 million cases in 2001.
 
As shown below, the US is the world's fourth largest importer of wine.
 
Table 6

The table below ranks US imports by country of origin as at June 2002, showing Australia's status as the third largest exporter to the US.
Table 7
 
Source: Adams Beverage Group 2002.
 
It is anticipated that the US market will continue to offer significant opportunities for exports as consumer preferences are expected to continue to shift toward wines from Australia and other countries.
 
Whilst offering growth potential, the US wine market is expected to become increasingly competitive. With significant new plantings in California and around the world, grape prices are already coming down resulting in price competition in the relevant wine market.  While lower price points (below US$5) continue to suffer from consumer trade up, the ultra-premium segment (above US$9) will also be hurt by the current economic conditions in the US.  The US$5-7 price point is still expected to provide strong growth opportunities for Australian wines.
 
Emerging pressures in the US wine market
 
Recent trends in the US wine industry pose a threat to the earnings prospects of participants.  These pressures include:
 
increasing consolidation at the supplier, wholesaler and retailer tiers of the US wine industry, with supermarkets, chain stores and retail super-centres taking market share away from traditional wine and liquor stores and imposing their purchasing power on producers;
 - 
                                         
 
increased advertising spending accompanied by the number of new entrants to the market and price/margin pressures;
 - 
                                         
 
price declines due to an oversupply of Californian wine grapes and import pressures;
 - 
                                         
 
              consumers trading down retail price points due to economic conditions in the US; and 
 - 
 
              increasing consumer demand for flavoured alcoholic beverages.
 - 
 
Trends in Australian exports to the US
 
The US continues to be a relatively high value market for Australian wine, with an average unit value of $6.17/litre in 2002, which is considerably higher than the average unit value in the UK market of $4.18.  The average unit value of exports to the US increased by 6.7% in 2002 compared to 2001.  This is related to a significant increase in the volumes at the higher price range of the market.
The volume of Australian wine sold in the US increased by 53% in 2002, compared to the previous year, with the highest volume growth in the price segment above $10 (231% increase) and in the price range between $2.50 and $5 (93% increase) followed by the $7.50 to $10 range (59% increase).
 
BRL's joint venture, PWP, has achieved good growth in both its key brands with AC Nielsen reporting that the volume of sold in the US to 23 November 2002 was up 124% on 2001, whilst the volume of sold was up 93%.  At US$11, American wine, has been insulated from the price discounting concentrated at the US$5-10 price point.  On the other hand, while Australian wine, , continues to benefit from distribution gains, PWP's Australian brands face tough competition in the US$5-7 price point from the likes of , and the soon to be released at US$5-7.  The soon to be released BRL wine, , to be distributed by PWP will compete at a similar price point.

UK wine industry
 
The UK wine market has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9% from 1997 to 2001, with sales totalling 5.1 billion in 2001.
 
Table 8
 
 
Source: Euromonitor.
 
The growth of UK wine consumption in the past five years has been higher than for all other alcoholic drinks and to the detriment of beer and spirits, making wine the largest off-premise category in the UK.  It is expected that the retail market for UK wine is likely to continue outperforming the other alcoholic drink sectors.
 
The UK is not a significant wine producing country and is heavily reliant on imported wine.  The UK wine market is fragmented with all the major wine producing countries competing for market share.  Competition has intensified amongst participants, with "New World" wine producers (eg Australia and Chile) taking market share away from traditional suppliers.  Wines from "New World" countries have generally been able to command higher average prices in the UK compared to wines from the traditional markets of France, Italy and Spain.
Market characteristics
 
Distribution
 
Over 80% of wine volumes sold in the UK is through off-license premises trade of which approximately 75% is distributed through grocery stores with the remainder distributed through specialist wine/alcoholic beverage stores.  Volume orders for the off-license trade are placed with UK agents and distributors, who in turn place orders and ensure delivery.  Historically, major grocers have gained market share at the expense of specialist fine wine stores.
 
UK wholesalers service the on-licence premises trade and source products from UK agents or direct from wine producers.  Larger restaurant chains may source direct from the producer.
 
Consumption profile
 
Whilst the UK has traditionally favoured the wines of its European neighbours, consumption of European wines has reduced due to the changing preferences.  This has shifted the volumes that the UK has imported from its traditional markets towards "New World" producers.
 
In contrast to other markets, UK consumers are aware of well-established grape varieties and are receptive to trying new varieties and blends.  Over the past 20 years, there has been a shift in the UK from sweet to dry and from white to red wines.  The increasing popularity of red wine can be attributed to the maturing tastes of the consumer and the health benefits that are associated with moderate daily consumption of red wine.
 
From 1997 to 2001, the consumption of wine in the UK has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 5%, with per capita wine consumption doubling over the past two decades.  This growth is set to continue, with UK census data indicating that the fastest growing age category over the next decade will be the 40-65 year age group, which is the highest consuming age group for wine.  The mass marketing of wine via the grocery channel has also resulted in growth in per capita consumption, a trend that is also set to continue.
 
According to market sources, the UK wine market continues to grow, with per capita consumption of wine currently at 22 litres compared to 14 litres in 1990.  New World wines are also expected to continue to grow at the expense of Old World wines, particularly French wines.
 
Australian exports into the UK
 
Australia's export wines have made significant in-roads into the UK wine market with wine volumes increasing 54% between 1997 and 2001.  The appeal of Australian wines lies in its consistent quality and diversity of styles.
 
Australian exports have surpassed France and Australia has become the largest wine exporter (by volume) to the UK, followed by France, Italy, Germany, South Africa and Spain.
The following table sets out Australia's respective share of the UK wine market at various price points.
 
Table 9

Notes:
(1)       JBWere estimates.
(2)       These totals do not represent a summation of the column headed Australia% share, as the percentages represents Australia's percentage share of the UK market at each pricing point.
 
As set out in the above table, the following comments can be made with respect to the UK market and Australian wine producers relative market share:
 
42% of total sales (by volume) occur in the sub 3.50 category.  Australian exporters have 5.8% market share within this price point;
 - 
                                     
 
43% of total sales (by volume) occur in the 3.00 to 6.00 category.  Australian exporters have 24.1% market share within this price point;
 - 
                                     
 
5% of total sales (by volume) occur in the 6.00+ category.  Australian exporters have 40% market share within this price point; and
 - 
                                     
 
             the 4.00 to 6.00 price point is expected to generate the most growth over the next 3 years.
 - 
 
The above data highlights that although Australian exporters have strong market share in the fine wine segment, they have a comparatively lower penetration in the sub 3.50 category within the UK wine market.  This is consistent with Australian wine importers past strategies, however, new growth opportunities may exist in lower price points.
 
The following table sets out the composition of key Australian wine companies that import to the UK, in terms of volume.

(2) Excludes US and New Zealand.
(3) Excludes BOB and James Herrick.
 
As set out in the above table, BRL is the largest Australian exporter of wines (by volume) to the UK, followed by Southcorp and Orlando.
 
The average price per litre of Australian wine exports to the UK has flattened recently.  This has been as a result of changes in product mix by some producers' choosing to increase exports of wine in the 4.00 or less retail price bracket.  The ability to maintain margins and compete within these lower price points will depend on the Australian wine producers unit cost of production and prevailing exchange rates.
 
Australian producers are also facing increasing competition from other "New World" wine producers such as the US, South American countries, New Zealand and South Africa.
 
Issues in the UK market
 
Whilst the UK market has delivered excellent growth for Australian wine exporters, industry participants will need to respond to the following challenges:
 
              increased competition from "New World" suppliers, particularly producers from the US and South Africa;
 - 
 
              increased price discounting and promotional activity by producers placing pressure on margins;
 - 
 
              potential wine oversupply issues, particularly in Australia and the US;
 - 
 
              consolidation of retailers and increased margin pressure resulting from concentrated retailer purchasing power;
 - 
 
              changing inventory management practices by UK retailers; and
 - 
 
              economic conditions within the UK market.

PROFILE OF BRL HARDY LIMITED
 
4.1         
Company history and overview
 
BRL was formed in 1992 as a result of the merger between Berri Renmano Limited and the Thomas Hardy & Sons Group and was listed on the ASX in the same year.  Since listing, BRL has grown to become Australia's second largest wine making company and one of the ten largest wine companies in the world.  The Company is a major exporter of wine with significant exports to Europe and a growing presence in the North American wine market.  Key wine making operations are located in Australia and New Zealand.
 
The growth in the Company's sales has been predominantly organic together with some strategic acquisitions of wineries and vineyards.  BRL continues to expand its offshore presence in key overseas markets and as part of this strategy has entered into joint ventures and acquired businesses in key growth markets such as North America and New Zealand.
 
In 2000 BRL acquired Nobilo Wine Group Limited ("Nobilo"), New Zealand's second largest wine producer.  Nobilo is the exclusive distributor of BRL's wines in New Zealand and exports its wine to North America, Europe, Australia and other parts of the world using the BRL distribution network.
 
In August 2001, BRL entered into a joint venture with Constellation to form Pacific Wine Partners, LLC ("PWP") in which each party has an equal 50% share.  This joint venture distributes BRL wines into the US market with management including executives from both companies.  BRL's initial investment in PWP was approximately US$114 million.  PWP subsequently acquired the US based Blackstone business and brand in October 2001.

Based on recent trends, the contribution of export markets to total sales is expected to increase as the company experiences higher levels of growth in the export sector, relative to the Australian domestic market.
 
A brief description of BRL's activities in each of its major markets is set out below.
 
Australia
 
Australia represents a key market for the Company representing over 40% of 2001 sales revenue.  The Australian business comprises the sale of bottled and cask wine, spirits and commercial and bulk wine.  The business operates in all States and has established a strong marketing and distribution network with strong supply arrangements with major wholesale and retail customers.  The Company's sales (by volume) are predominantly in the lower to mid-range price points, although the Company has established a range of premium wine products.
 
The Australian business has achieved compound annual volume growth of 6.4% during the three years to 2001.  Total market volumes have experienced compound annual growth of 3.6% over the same period.
The Australian business operates in a mature market characterised by:
 
low growth in consumption with a compound annual growth rate of 2.2% between 1998 and 2002;
 - 
                                         
 
strong competition following recent consolidation of wine producers; and
 - 
                                         
 
margin pressure due to:
 - 
                                         
discounting practices by competitors;
 - 
                                         
 
changing consumption patterns with higher levels of growth in bottled wine relative to cask wine;
 - 
                                         
 
retailer consolidation; and
 - 
                                         
 
rising inventory levels following above average grape harvests.
 - 
                                         
 
Europe
 
Europe accounts for approximately 43% of sales.  Much of the growth experienced by BRL in the past few years has been attributable to exports in the UK market, which represent over 85% of BRL's sales to Europe.  Sales to Europe have grown by an average of 34% per annum for the three years to 2001.
 
Whilst the UK is regarded as a relatively mature market, BRL believes significant opportunities still exist for the Company to grow its share of that market.  Wine consumption in the UK has experienced compound annual growth of about 5% from 1997 to 2001.
 
BRL sells into the UK market through its own distribution network, which has established strong relationships with major customers.  The s and brands have performed strongly with the largest selling brand in the off-trade market and the fastest growing brand.

BRL also supplies pubs and other licensed hospitality outlets, however, the Company has a relatively low penetration of this market.
 
Marketing efforts in mainland Europe are at a relatively early stage.  At present, BRL exports wines mainly to Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.  BRL views mainland Europe as an area that has potential for substantial growth.  As with the UK, Australian wines compete in the "new world" sector.  The Company's strategy remains to focus on the food retail channel to distribute its products in these markets.
 
BRL also owns La Baume, a small French wine producer.  In 2002 La Baume sold about 2.5 million litres of wine, the majority via BRL Hardy Europe into the UK market.
 
Whilst the European markets have delivered excellent growth, significant future growth potential exists for BRL products particularly within lower price points not previously targeted.  BRL, as with other Australian wine exporters to this market, will face continued margin pressure through:
 
              ongoing consolidation of customers;
 - 
 
              consolidation of wine supply companies;
 - 
 
              competition from other "New World" suppliers (US, South Africa and Chile); and
 - 
 
              strengthening of the Australian currency.
 - 
Further growth will depend upon the penetration of BRL products into new markets and continued brand and product development.
 
North America
 
In August 2001 BRL formed PWP, a joint venture with Constellation, which distributes and markets wine (including BRL and Nobilo wines) into the US market.  In addition PWP also owns the Blackstone Brand, winemaking facilities and vineyards in California.
 
The US, with retail wine sales of US$19 billion in 2001, is viewed as a significant growth opportunity for Australian wine makers as US consumption of Australian wines is less than 3.5% of total wine sales.  Currently BRL has a 7% market share of Australian wine imported into the US, compared with 25% to 30% in the UK market.
 
The establishment of PWP and the subsequent acquisition of Blackstone Wineries were aimed at achieving BRL's dual strategy of increasing sales of Australian wine to the US, (particularly in the US$5-12 retail price points which management has identified as the greatest opportunity for growth) and developing a US produced wine for the US market.  In the short term, PWP's focus is on building its share of the US market through promoting the Blackstone and Banrock Station brands.  Both these brands have experienced significant sales volume growth (albeit off a low base) in the past year.
 
PWP also presents an opportunity to export US made wines to UK and mainland Europe via the BRL distribution network.  The weakening US dollar and oversupply of wine has enabled US wines to compete on price against wines from other "New World" suppliers.
 
New Zealand
 
BRL has a significant presence in the New Zealand wine market through its acquisition of Nobilo in 2000. This acquisition enabled BRL to increase its market share of the New Zealand wine market through sales generated by Nobilo and also facilitating distribution of BRL's Australian wines in New Zealand.
 
Since the acquisition, Nobilo has been expanding rapidly acquiring land and vineyards in New Zealand to boost the supply of grapes, particularly Sauvignon Blanc.  Presently, a large proportion of grapes are sourced externally from contracted and uncontracted growers.  In 2002 the Nobile grape intake was almost 10,000 tonnes, of which around 13% was supplied from Nobilo owned or controlled vineyards.  Nobilo is seeking to increase its supply of grapes from company-owned vineyards to supplement the supply from non-contracted growers for key varieties.  Nobilo currently has around 757 hectares of vineyards in New Zealand.
 
The New Zealand wine market (domestic and export) was estimated to be 76 million litres in 2002 and has grown by about 24% since 1997.  Management believes Nobilo has approximately a 7.6% share of the New Zealand market.  Nobilo sales (export and domestic) totalled 950,000 cases in 2002, an increase of over 45% in the last four years.
 
Nobilo is strong in the bottled red and white wine market, but to date has been unable to establish a significant position in the high volume cask wine or sparkling wine categories.
Approximately 60% of Nobilo's wine production is exported predominantly to the US and UK.  It is envisaged that the proportion of wine exported will continue to grow with significant growth expected in exports of Sauvignon Blanc to Europe and North America.
 
Rest of the world
 
Sales to the rest of the world are relatively minor with a large proportion of sales in this category sold throughout Asia.
 
4.2.3       Grape cultivation and supply
 
BRL owns or has interests in 3,314 hectares of vineyards in Australia, New Zealand and France.  The Company owns vineyards in most of Australia's major wine regions.  Details of BRL's vineyards are set out in the table below.
 
Table 11
 
 
Source: BRL Management.
Notes:
1 Includes joint venture and/or leased vineyards, but not contract suppliers.
2 Excludes PWP vineyard holdings in the US of approximately 569 hectares.
 
Grapes from Company owned, joint venture or leased vineyards account for around 7% of BRL's total annual grape requirements with the balance largely sourced from contract growers.  BRL's vineyards supply the majority of its requirements for super premium fruit.
 
The table below summarises the source of BRL's Australian grape intake from 1999 to 2002.
Table 12
 
 
 
Source: BRL Management.
Note: (1) CCW is a fruit grower co-operative.
 
The record Australian grape vintage in 2002, resulted in BRL's grape intake being in excess of budgeted requirements.  Under the terms of the grape supply contracts, BRL was required to take the higher than expected vintage.  BRL has developed a strategy to reduce the surplus inventories by selectively reducing the intake of certain grape varieties in future years.
 
BRL has also taken steps to renegotiate its supply arrangements with contracted growers to provide for greater flexibility in the supply of grapes to ensure that future supply and demand are more closely aligned and pricing takes into account demand and supply conditions.
 
This process includes:
 
              adopting a new pricing model which supports multi-tier pricing for different types of red grape varieties;
 - 
 
              amending the product quality bonus scheme so that bonuses are capped; and
 - 
 
              non-renewal of some grape supply contracts.
 - 
 
As contracts are typically negotiated on a three-year rolling basis, the financial and operational impact of these measures will have a phased impact on results in future years.
 
Management of future grape intakes will continue to pose a risk to the business, with the reduction in the current surplus position to be managed over the next three to four years.
 
4.2.4       Wine production
 
BRL has wineries in several locations throughout Australia, including ACT, NSW, Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and overseas in France and New Zealand.  The Company produces approximately 95% of its wines from its own or contract wineries. There are plans to upgrade existing wineries and to develop new facilities, including a $12.4 million expansion and upgrade of packaging facilities and capital expenditure of $37.5 million on wineries, to support the future growth in wine production.      The table below summarises the capacity of BRL's existing winery facilities.

BRL undertakes the majority of packaging at its own facilities, with  cask wines packaged at Berri Estates and Stanley and bottling carried out at Reynella and Houghton in Australia and Nobilo in New Zealand.

During the period January 2002 to December 2002, BRL's share price declined by approximately 36%.  From a peak of $11.67 in March 2002 (around the time of the release of its 2001 results and positive external comments regarding the future outlook for the Company) the share price has trended downwards and closed at $7.67 on 13 January 2003.  Many of its peers have also experienced similar price declines (eg. Southcorp's share price fell by 40% over the same period) while the All Ordinaries Index fell by approximately 10%.  The decline of BRL's share price may have been caused by a number of factors, including:
 
concerns regarding future earnings growth because of strong competition in the export markets for Australian wine;
 - 
                                         
 
the perceived impact of the economic slowdown on wine consumption in key markets to which BRL exports;
 - 
                                         
market concerns over potential oversupply of grapes in the Australian and the global market;
 - 
                                         
 
concerns about the appreciation of the Australian dollar which potentially has an impact on the price competitiveness of Australian wines in the export market;
 - 
                                         
 
concerns regarding BRL's large 2002 vintage intake and its impact on inventory levels and future cash flows; and
 - 
                                         
 
general share market conditions, which saw the rerating of many "growth" companies such as BRL, which traded at higher than average price to earnings ratios.
 - 
                                         
 
The figure below shows that over the past few years BRL has outperformed the broader Australian share market as well as the S&P/ASX200 Food and Beverage Index of which BRL is a member.  However, more recently BRL's share price performance has under performed the benchmark indices.

4.6          Outlook
 
The Company operates in a competitive environment and faces numerous risks and opportunities, some of which include:
 
growing overseas appreciation and demand for Australian wines;
 - 
                                         
 
scope for substantial growth in most of BRL's export markets, particularly the US market;
 - 
                                         
 
expansion into new markets through joint ventures and widening product range;
 - 
                                         
 
ability to expand the range of premium wines;
 - 
                                         
 
active participation in industry rationalisation through the acquisition of assets or businesses;
 - 
                                         
 
pressure on margins due to strong competitive environment and increased retailer concentration;
 - 
                                         
 
global oversupply of grapes and wine;
 - 
                                         
 
              management of grape supply contracts and future inventory levels;
 - 
 
potential appreciation of the Australian dollar which diminishes cost competitiveness in export markets;
 - 
                                         
 
competition in key markets from other "New World" producing regions, such as the US, Chile and South Africa;
 -

Statement of financial performance
 
BRL's earnings for the four years ending 31 December 2001 and the six months to 30 June 2002 are set out in the table below.
 
Table 18
 
 
 
Source: Annual Report, Half Yearly Report.
Note: BRL financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Aus GAAP.
 
Sales for the year ended 31 December 2001 were $757.6 million, an increase of 20.8% compared to the prior year.  BRL has achieved a compound annual sales growth rate of 20.7% between 1998 and 2001.
 
Profit after tax in the period from 1998 to 2001 has grown from $38.6 million to $72.2 million, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 23.1%.  Profit margins have remained relatively constant, however, the Company is currently experiencing pressure on margins in some of its key markets.  Management believes that future profit growth will largely be driven by volume growth in BRL's key export markets.
 
As BRL derives a significant proportion of its revenues from exports, BRL has undertaken a risk management strategy to limit its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.  Hedging its exposure to movements in exchange rates may result in exchange rate gains or losses when the underlying physical transaction occurs.  These gains or losses are reflected in BRL's earnings.
Interest expense has been growing because of BRL's increasing debt levels.  Borrowings have increased to fund BRL's expansion, ongoing operations and holding costs associated with the greater than expected inventory levels.  Interest rate cover (EBIT to interest expense) for the year ended December 2001 was 5.5 times.
 
A breakdown of sales and corresponding EBIT for each geographic region for 1999 to 2002 is presented below.

N/a  not applicable
1 BRL excludes PWP sales from BRL sales figures, but includes its 50% share of PWP's profit before tax.
 
Sales within the Australian and European markets comprise over 80% of total revenues.  Australian wine sales have been relatively flat compared to the sales growth achieved in other export markets.  The performance in Europe for the first six months of 2002 was not as good as expected which was largely caused by a number of non-recurring events, including faulty cask wine taps which resulted in the cask wine being off retail shelves for more than a month.
 
The contribution of PWP to earnings is evidenced in the June 2002 half-year results, which were more than double the EBIT derived in 2001, the year PWP commenced business.
 
Management believes that sales to Europe and North America will be the main sources of future growth.
EBIT margins on Australasian sales have fallen from 14.9% in 1999 to approximately 12.0% in June 2002.  In Australia, profit margins have declined due to price competition from other wine makers and also due to the pricing power held by the major retailers.
 
4.8         
Statements of financial position
 
BRL's statements of financial position as at 31 December 2000 and 2001 and 30 June 2002 are set out in the table below.
 
Table 20
 
 
 
Source: Annual report, Half Yearly Report.
Note: BRL financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Aus GAAP.
The nature of BRL's business requires extensive investment in working capital.  In the last few years, BRL has built up large inventories of wine to sustain the growth it has experienced.  Inventory levels at 30 June 2002 were 56% higher than at December 2001.  Inventory levels are typically greater in the first half of the year due to the timing of the grape harvest.
 
As discussed earlier, the 2002 vintage intake was in excess of BRL's requirements.  Management believes that this imbalance will be addressed in the future as the inventory levels are progressively reduced.  Furthermore, it is believed that the excess inventories may actually be a positive for the Company if drought conditions in Australia persist and reduce the 2003 grape harvest.
 
BRL's investments largely represent BRL's equity accounted interests in associated companies, including PWP.  BRL's share of profits from these associated companies are reflected in the earnings of BRL.  Details of the associated companies are set out in the table below.
 
Table 21
 
 
 
Source: Annual and Half-Year Reports.
Note:
1 Interest in Medallion Wine Marketing Inc. increased from 18% to 25% effective 1 November 2002.
 
BRL also has an investment in GSI.  The book value of this investment is approximately $25.6 million.
 
Plant, property and equipment of $411 million represents assets used in the operations of the business such as wineries, packaging facilities, land and buildings etc.  The value of BRL's grapevines are also included on the statement of financial position as these are regarded as self-generating and regenerating assets.
 
BRL had borrowings of $620 million as at 30 June 2002, or a debt to equity ratio of approximately 85% (based on the book value of net assets).  Increased debt arose largely as a consequence of the increase in inventory in the 2002 financial year.
4.9         
Statements of cash flow
 
BRL's statements of cash flows for the three years ended December 1999, 2000 and 2001 and the six months ended June 2002 are set out in the table below.
 
Table 22
 
 
 
Source: Annual Reports, Half Yearly Report.
Note: BRL financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Aus GAAP.
 
Whilst profits have been increasing, operating cash flows have been negative mainly because of the large investments in inventories and working capital.  The negative free cash flow has required the Company to increase its borrowings to fund its expansion plans.
 
Management expects operating cash flow to be positive in 2003 regardless of the size of the 2003 vintage.  If drought conditions reduce the vintage below normal levels, cash flow will exceed current expectations.
 
The majority of the high level of cash outflow from investing activities in 2001 is accounted for by BRL's investment in PWP.

PROFILE OF CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC
 
5.1         
Company History and Overview
 
Constellation, headquartered in Fairport, New York, went public in 1973 and is currently listed on the NYSE.  Constellation's principal activities are the production and marketing of beverage alcohol brands in North America and the United Kingdom.
 
Constellation's portfolio of more than 200 products, covers the major beverage alcohol categories of imported beer, wine and distilled spirits.  Constellation's broad portfolio provides the company with diversification, particularly should specific segments within the beverage alcohol industry experience a downturn.  It also allows Constellation to allocate resources to faster growing categories.
 
Constellation operates twenty-nine production facilities throughout the world.  In the United Kingdom, Constellation is considered to be a leading producer and marketer of wine and cider and a leading independent on-premise drinks wholesaler.
 
Constellation has established the following market profile:
 
Table 23
 
 
Source: Constellation Brands, Inc. 2002 Annual Report, Scheme Booklet.
Note: Classification is volume based.
 
Constellation's products are distributed by more than 1,000 wholesale distributors in North America.  In the United Kingdom, Constellation distributes its branded products and those of other companies to more than 16,500 customers in the United Kingdom, through its subsidiary, Matthew Clark.
5.2         
Business Segments
 
The business segments and divisions of Constellation, together with their leading brands are set out in the following diagram:
 
Figure 13
 
 
Source:  Constellation Brands, Inc. website and Constellation Brands, Inc. 2002 Annual Report.
Notes:
1 Comprises U.K. Brands (10%), U.K. Wholesale (18%).
2 Constellation's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive performance based distribution agreements with suppliers.
3 Brands owned by BRL and distributed by PWP. n/a = not applicable.
Constellation has grown through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions.  Constellation's internal growth has been driven by leveraging its existing portfolio of leading brands, developing new products, new packaging and line extensions and focusing on the faster growing sectors of the beverage alcohol industry.  Constellation's current growth opportunities are from its imported beer, fine wine and United Kingdom wholesale businesses.
 
Constellation's divisions act independently and are empowered to make decisions regarding their marketing, sales and production requirements.  Constellation has found this operational structure effective, as it enables it to react more dynamically to changing consumer requirements and consumption patterns.
5.3         
Operations
 
Constellation operates 29 production facilities, most of which have warehousing and distribution facilities.  The facilities comprise twenty grape processing facilities, seven distilled spirits facilities, a cider processing facility and a bottled water facility.
 
Constellation owns or leases approximately 6,500 acres of land and vineyards in California, New York and Chile.  This acreage however, only supplies a small percentage of Constellation's grape requirements.
 
In the United States, Constellation purchases several varieties of grapes from approximately 800 independent growers, located principally in California.  Constellation enters into annual purchase agreements with the majority of these independent growers.  These grapes are crushed at Constellation's wineries, made into wine under brand names owned by Constellation, sold to other companies for resale under their own labels and/or shipped to customers in the form of juice or juice concentrate.
 
5.3.1       Imported beer and spirits (Barton)
 
This  segment imports and markets a diversified range of beer and also produces, bottles, imports, exports and markets distilled spirits.  As the third largest marketer of imported beer in the United States, it distributes six of the top 25 imported beer brands, including the top selling Corona Extra.  In addition, it sells spirits in bulk and provides contract production and bottling services for third parties.
 
Constellation's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive performance based distribution agreements with suppliers.  The most significant is the contract  for Corona Extra and other Mexican beer brands, which expires in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria, will be automatically renewed for additional terms of 5 years.  The exclusive distribution agreements contain certain performance criteria, which may result in early termination if they are not met.  Constellation has historically met these performance criteria.
 
Constellation produces and ages distilled spirits in four distilleries that it owns and operates in Kentucky, Georgia, Alberta and Quebec.  The raw materials required by Constellation's distilleries are sourced from contractual arrangements that it has with suppliers and through the open market.
 
In the United States, Constellation also owns, leases and operates three bottling plants  located in Georgia, Kentucky and California.
 
5.3.2       Popular and premium wine (Canandaigua Wine Company)
 
The popular and premium wine segment produces, bottles, imports and markets wine and brandy in the United States.  As the second largest supplier of wine in the United States, it distributes 18 of the top one hundred wine brands in the United States and exports wine to approximately sixty countries.  In addition, it is also a leading grape juice concentrate producer in the United States.  The segment operates twelve wineries in New York, California, Washington and Idaho of which nine are owned whilst the remaining are leased.  Constellation owns or leases approximately 2,800 acres of vineyards in California and New York.
5.3.3       UK brands and wholesale (Matthew Clark)
 
This segment produces and markets wine, cider and bottled water from three production facilities in the United Kingdom.  Matthew Clark is an independent on-premise drinks wholesaler throughout the United Kingdom and operates eleven distribution centres that distribute products produced by Constellation and third parties.
 
Constellation sources wine on a contracted basis and on the open market whilst cider apples are sourced through long-term supply arrangements.
 
5.3.4       Fine wine (Franciscan)
 
This segment is a supplier to the super-premium and ultra-premium wine market and exports to approximately 25 countries from the United States.
 
Constellation owns and operates six wineries in California and through a majority owned subsidiary operates a winery in Chile.  This segment also owns and leases approximately 2,700 acres of vineyards in California and approximately 1,000 acres of vineyards in Chile.
 
5.4         
Key success factors
 
The key success factors identified by Constellation's management include the following:
 
brand equity: continual investment in brand equity and establishing a presence in all the major beverage alcohol categories.  In addition, Constellation owns a significant proportion of the trademarks that it uses;
 - 
                                         
 
exclusive distribution agreements: renewal of exclusive distribution agreements;
 -

Constellation's strategy has been to maintain pricing points and brand equity and not engage in price competitive behaviour;
                                        
 
as a result of Constellation's brand equity, it has experienced a return to more normal results.

Strategic acquisitions
 
Constellation has grown organically and through acquisitions.
 
Constellation's organic growth has been generated from product development, brand building and by focussing on the faster growing sectors of the  beverage alcohol industry.
 
Constellation has also grown through acquisition with the following acquisitions completed since 1999.

Notes:
(1) Purchase price includes a performance-based component.
(2) EBITDA multiple was derived based on EBITDA before synergies.
 
Constellation's acquisition strategy involves identifying opportunities to acquire additional businesses, assets or companies that it believes will provide a strategic fit with its existing business.  Strategic benefits may include establishing a dominant presence in core geographic regions, acquiring brands and products to enhance its brand portfolio, expanding distribution channels and enhancing shareholder value  by leveraging synergies and channelling resources towards higher margin sectors.
 
Constellation has developed strict financial criteria for identifying strategic acquisitions and is able to use this experience in integrating such acquisitions into its portfolio.  For the fiscal year ended 2002, Constellation disclosed that acquisitions contributed over $220 million to net sales.
 
In July 2001, Constellation and BRL formed a joint venture, PWP, which is equally owned.  The joint venture was formed to produce, market and sell wine in the United States.  During the fiscal 2002 year, PWP acquired certain assets of the Blackstone Winery including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business in Sonoma County, California.

Statements of financial performance
 
The audited financial results of Constellation for the years ended February 1998 to 2002 and the unaudited financial results for the nine months ended November 2002 are summarised in the following table:

Notes:
Constellation financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
(1) Earnings per share ("EPS") are before extraordinary items and has been retrospectively adjusted to take account of share splits.
Net sales = Gross sales less excise taxes, returns and allowances.
EBIT = Earnings before Interest and Taxes.
EBITDA = Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation.
n/a = Not applicable.
 
The results for the 2002 fiscal year includes seven months contribution from PWP (established August 2001) and eight months contribution from Ravenswood (acquired July 2001).  The 2003 fiscal year will be the first year in which the full results of both PWP and Ravenswood are included.
Net interest expense for the 2002 fiscal year increased by approximately 5.2%, which reflects the higher level of borrowings which funded recent acquisitions.
 
On 1 March 2002, Constellation adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142").  As at 28 February 2002, approximately 22% of total assets represented unamortised goodwill, which will periodically be evaluated for impairment.

(1) Net sales  Gross sales less excise taxes, returns and allowances.
 
Imported beer and spirits
 
The growth in imported beer sales can primarily be attributed to an increase in sales in the Mexican beer portfolio.
 
Popular and premium wine
 
The 25% increase in net sales for the 2002 fiscal year can be attributed to the contribution from acquired assets comprising the Turner Road Vintners assets and Corus assets.  The increase was tempered with declines in the grape juice concentrate business and other wine brands.
 
Fine wine
 
Net sales increased during the 2002 fiscal year by approximately 53%, which can primarily be attributed to the 8 months contribution from Ravenswood (acquired July 2001) and organic sales growth of certain brands within the fine wine portfolio.
UK brands and wholesale
 
Net sales increased during the 2002 fiscal year by approximately 15%, or 19% when the effects of the adverse foreign currency movements are excluded.  The growth can be attributed to a 27.1% increase in the U.K. wholesale business and a 7.4% increase in branded wine sales, which were partially offset by a decrease in cider sales.
 
Constellation has not paid any cash dividends since its initial public offering in 1973, which is consistent with its policy of retaining all earnings to finance the development and expansion of its business.  Constellation's financing facilities (i.e.  senior credit facility,  senior notes and senior subordinated notes) also contain covenants that restrict the payment of cash dividends.

Note: Prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
 
Constellation's investment in the PWP Joint Venture (US$110.5 million) is equity accounted and included in the other non current assets balance.
 
Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market with approximately 67% of the balance comprised of in-process inventories (i.e. barrelled whiskey and brandy and bulk wine inventories).  The inventories balance has increased by 16%.
 
5.12.2     Liabilities
 
Reference is made to Section 5.5 of the Explanatory Statement, which details the borrowings of Constellation.  The borrowings of Constellation as at February 2002 are summarised in the following table:
 
Table 35
 
 
Source: Constellation Brands, Inc. 2002 Annual Report.
Note: Prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
 
Constellation's borrowings are subject to certain lending covenants and it is required to maintain certain financial ratios, the most significant being the debt coverage ratio.
Borrowings, including the senior credit facility, were originally incurred to finance acquisitions such as the acquisition of Franciscan Estates and Simi.  A syndicate of banks refinanced the majority of these loans with a senior credit facility (commitment of up to US$1 billion). Proceeds from senior notes have predominantly been applied to reduce pre-existing borrowings.
 
5.13       
Future direction
 
The future strategic direction disclosed by Constellation as disclosed in their 2002 Annual Report is summarised below:
 
              capitalising on diverse consumer preferences
 - 
 
establishing a broad product portfolio reduces Constellation's dependence on a single  beverage alcohol category
                                        
 
this strategy focuses on establishing leading brands in all major beverage alcohol categories
                                        
 
              building powerful consumer brands
 - 
 
building brands through innovation, revitalisation and acquisition (i.e. distinctive labelling, line extensions, new packaging, etc.)
                                        
 
              achieving critical mass
 - 
 
through selective acquisitions and planned growth
                                        
 
              allocating resources to the faster growing segments
 - 
 
the PWP joint venture with BRL, provides Constellation with greater participation in Australian wines, which is considered to be the fastest growing imported wine segment in the United States
                                        
 
this strategy is supported by purchasing or leasing additional vineyards
                                        
 
              staying close of customers
 - 
 
the divisions of Constellation operate separately, which enables each segment to more dynamically respond to changes in customer preferences and changing consumption patterns

COMBINED ENTITY
 
6.1         
Overview of the Combined Entity
 
The merger of Constellation and BRL will create one of the world's leading wine companies and a significant global producer and distributor of other alcoholic beverages.  The Combined Entity will produce and distribute products to the US, UK and Australian markets with sales to over 60 other countries.
 
6.2         
Impact of the Proposed Merger
 
If the Share Scheme is approved, BRL will be removed from the ASX.
 
BRL's existing directors will resign and Constellation will appoint representatives to the BRL board.
 
Constellation intends to establish a global wine division, with Stephen Millar to be appointed to the role of Chief Executive Officer. Constellation also intends to undertake a detailed review of the BRL business post merger, for opportunities to maximise shareholder value.
 
The merger of Constellation and BRL is expected to deliver a number of operational and financial benefits including:
 
the additional size and breadth of the Combined Entity's operations should enable it to build upon the platform for growth already established by the individual entities in the UK, mainland Europe and North American markets;
 - 
                                         
 
Constellation will control a diversified portfolio of global brands.  The company will continue to have a strong business in US imported beer and US spirits, as well as a large UK distribution business.  The Combined Entity will have an extensive distribution network with national scale and reach within chosen markets.  This is likely to strengthen the Combined Entity's position in chosen markets and enhance its revenue growth potential;
 - 
                                         
 
the merged entity will gain significant scale, with total sales of over US$3 billion, including total wine sales of approximately US$1.7 billion;
 - 
                                         
 
the Combined Entity will have considerable wine operations in the principal "New World" wine producing regions of North America, Australia and New Zealand.  "New World" wine producers have performed strongly in the UK and consequently, the Combined Entity will be well positioned to take advantage of further growth in this market.  The Combined Entity will be able to capitalise on the demand for Australian wines in Europe and the US;
 - 
                                         
 
              the merged entity may benefit from the combining of two experienced management teams;
 - 
 
the portfolio of wine brands and labels offered by the Combined Entity will have considerable depth in each category and key price points.  The aggregate portfolio will have a greater range of products and greater geographic reach; and
 - 
                                         
 
the Combined Entity should benefit from an increased geographic diversity, providing for potentially greater flexibility in inventory and capital management.
 - 
                                         
Synergies and cost savings
 
Constellation expects to generate synergies in the area of sales and profit margins through increased industry strength and a broader and stronger product portfolio in key export markets.
 
Potential synergies may also include cost savings from the global procurement of suppliers, back office synergies and synergies from merging Constellation's Matthew Clark distribution with BRL Hardy UK.
 
Constellation believes that some cost savings may also be achieved in the areas of its financing arrangements, salaries, office expenses, general expenses, corporate and administrative overheads.
 
6.2.1       Combined Entity risks
 
The following risk factors have been identified in relation to the Combined Entity.
 
 - 
                                         
Synergies
 
The extent to which the potential synergies will be realised is dependent on management's ability to integrate the businesses, products, systems and personnel into the Combined Entity.  Potential risks associated with the merger may include the cost and difficulty of integrating the businesses together and diversion of management time.  Constellation has had the benefit of having completed and integrated numerous acquisitions.  There can be no assurance, however, that Constellation will be successful in realising these synergies and cost savings.
 
 - 
                                         
Indebtedness
 
Constellation will incur substantial additional debt to finance the proposed acquisition. Based on the proforma financial data set out in Section 5 of the Explanatory Statement (and summarised in Section 6.3 of this report) the ratio of total debt to shareholders equity will increase from 1.2 to 2.5 (Scenario 1) and 1.6 (Scenario 2).  Interest cover (the ratio of EBIT to net interest expense) will reduce from 4.1 to 2.8 (Scenario 1) and 3.2 (Scenario 2).
 
Constellation's ability to meet its increased financing obligations will be dependent upon its future operating performance as well as future interest rates, economic conditions in key markets and other factors that may be beyond the company's control.
 
The terms of the debt financing may impact upon the company's ability to pay dividends, undertake further acquisitions, obtain additional financing for working capital or limit the company's ability to conduct its business in certain circumstances. This issue is discussed in further detail in Section 6.1 of the Explanatory Statement.
 
 - 
                                         
Volatility of Constellation's stock price and CDI's
 
Due to the volatility of the NYSE and ASX markets and global stock markets generally trading in Constellation scrip and the price of Constellation CDI's could fluctuate for reasons unrelated to operating performance of the company.
 
The volume of trading in Constellation CDI's may be less than the level of trading in BRL Shares or Constellation Shares on the NYSE.
 
 - 
                                         
Regulatory restrictions
 
As the merger is subject to a number of anti-trust and competition regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions, there may be findings by some authorities, which may have adverse consequences that may impact upon the operations and activities of the Combined Entity.
 - 
                                         
Other Risks
 
The merged entity will have a different geographic operating and product profile compared to BRL. The business will face a number of risks that may adversely impact on the future reported earnings and cashflows of the business and the value of Constellation Shares.  These risks are discussed in detail in Section 6 of the Explanatory Statement and include:
 
termination or non-renewal of imported beer distribution agreements;
         
 
changes in excise taxes;
         
 
changes in the regulatory environment in key markets;
         
 
dependence upon the performance of wholesalers in the US market;
         
 
future grape supply;
         
 
changes in consumption patterns;
         
 
foreign currency fluctuations;
         
 
recoverable value of goodwill; and
         
 
financial performance of acquisitions and joint ventures.
         
 
BRL Shareholders considering taking the Constellation Scrip Consideration should read in detail the risk factors outlined in the Explanatory Statement.

Financial impact of the Proposed Merger
 
Set out below is the unaudited pro-forma statement of financial position as at 30 November 2002 and unaudited pro-forma statement of financial performance for the nine-month period ended 30 November 2002 of the Combined Entity, as prepared by Constellation management in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP").
 
BRL currently prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Aus GAAP whilst Constellation prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP.  As it relates to BRL, there are certain material differences in preparing consolidated financial statements under Aus GAAP compared to US GAAP.  In preparing the pro-forma statements, the unaudited financial statements of BRL as at 30 November 2002 were adjusted in accordance with US GAAP and translated into US dollar equivalent financial statements. In addition, the relevant acquisition adjustments were presented, including the effect of the Proposed Merger on the debt position of the Combined entity under two scenarios as outlined below.
 
The pro-forma statements
 
The pro-forma statements have been prepared based on two scenarios:
 
Scenario 1: BRL Shareholders and Optionholders only accept the Cash Consideration option; and
 - 
                                         
 
Scenario 2: Constellation will issue 15 million new Shares to accepting BRL Shareholders as Scrip Consideration with the balance of the consideration, cash.
 - 
                                         
 
Details of the assumptions adopted in the preparation of the pro-forma financial statements as well as the nature of the adjustments  are set out  in the notes to the financial statements presented in Section 5 of the Explanatory Statement.  The pro-forma statements should be read in conjunction with these notes.
We have not carried out any audit or verification of the pro-forma financial statements.
 
Pro-forma Statement of financial position
 
The unaudited pro-forma condensed combined statement of financial position assumes that the Proposed Schemes occurred on 30 November 2002, combining the historical statements of financial position of Constellation at 30 November 2002 with that of BRL as at 30 November 2002.
 
The unaudited pro-forma condensed combined Statement of Financial Position as at 30 November 2002 is set out below.

(2)
Prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
(3)
Scenario 1 presents the impact on the combined entity's financial position in case the Share Scheme Consideration is paid out 100% cash.
(4)
Scenario 2 presents the impact on the combined entity's financial position if under the Share Scheme the maximum of 15 million new shares in Constellation are issued to BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration and the balance of the Share Scheme Consideration is paid in cash.
Under Scenario 1 on a pro-forma basis, the net assets of the Combined Entity were US$1,118.8 million as at 30 November 2002 (US$1,493.8 million under Scenario 2).  The Proposed Merger has the impact of increasing the gearing ratio (calculated as the ratio of total debt to equity based on the book value of net assets) from 1.2 to 2.5 under Scenario 1 and to 1.6  under Scenario 2.  Total net debt for the consolidated Constellation group will increase from US$1.3 billion to US$2.8 under Scenario 1 and US$2.4 billion under Scenario 2.
 
Pro-forma statement of financial performance
 
The unaudited pro-forma statement of financial performance has been prepared as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of the nine-month period ended 30 November 2002, combining the historical results of Constellation for the nine months ended 30 November 2002 with those of BRL for the nine month period ended 30 November 2002. In addition, the pro-forma profit includes the results of PWP for the nine-month period ended 30 November 2002.

Post merger position of Constellation's share capital
 
As at 15 January 2003, Constellation had 78.5 million Class A Shares on issue.  Assuming the successful completion of the Proposed Schemes and BRL Shareholders elect to receive the Scrip Consideration, Constellation will issue up to 15 million new Constellation Class A Shares to BRL Shareholders.  These newly issued shares would have 7% of the total combined voting power of Constellation's Class A and Class B Shares.
 
Assuming 15 million new Constellation Shares are issued under the Share Scheme, the Principal Shareholders (the Sands family) will beneficially control 59% of the voting rights of the Combined Entity.
 
The Sands family will have sufficient voting power to control business matters, such as corporate transactions, including mergers or other business combinations involving Constellation, acquisition or disposal of assets, payment of dividends, appointment of directors, raising of debt and the issue of common stock or other securities in Constellation.

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES
 
7.1          Overview
 
To estimate the fair market value of the BRL Shares we have considered valuation methodologies recommended by ASIC Practice Note 43 regarding valuation reports of independent experts and common market practice.
 
Market based methods
 
Market based methods estimate a company's fair market value by considering the market price of transactions in its shares or the market value of comparable companies.  Market based methods include:
 
capitalisation of maintainable earnings;
 - 
                                        
 
analysis of a company's recent share trading history; and
 - 
                                        
 
industry specific methods.
 - 
                                        
 
The capitalisation of maintainable earnings method estimates fair market value based upon the company's future maintainable earnings and an appropriate earnings multiple derived from market transactions involving comparable companies.  The capitalisation of maintainable earnings method is appropriate where the company's earnings are relatively stable or a reliable trend in earnings is evident.
 
The recent share trading history provides reasonable evidence on the fair market value of minority parcels of shares in a company where they are publicly traded in an informed and liquid market.
 
Industry specific methods estimate fair market value using rules of thumb for a particular industry.  Generally rules of thumb provide less persuasive evidence in relation to the market value of a company as they may not account for company specific factors.
 
Discounted cash flow method
 
The discounted cash flow method estimates fair market value by discounting a company's future cash flows to their present value.  This method is appropriate where a projection of future cash flows can be made with a reasonable degree of confidence.  The discounted cash flow method is commonly used to value early stage companies or projects with a finite life.
 
Asset based methods
 
Asset based methods estimate the fair market value of a company's shares based on the realisable value of its identifiable net assets.  Asset based methods include:
 
orderly realisation of assets method;
 - 
                                         
 
liquidation of assets method; and
 - 
                                         
 
net assets on a going concern basis.
 - 
                                         
The orderly realisation of assets method estimates fair market value by determining the amount that would be distributed to shareholders assuming the company is wound up in an orderly manner.  The liquidation method is similar to the orderly realisation of assets methods except the liquidation method assumes the assets are sold in a shorter time frame.  The net assets on a going concern basis estimates the market values of the net assets of the entity but does not take account of realisation costs.
 
These approaches ignore the possibility that the company's value could exceed the realisable value of its assets.  Asset based methods are appropriate when companies are not profitable or a significant proportion of a company's assets are liquid.
 
7.2         
Selection of methodology
 
Valuation of BRL
 
We are of the opinion that the most appropriate methodology to value the BRL Shares is the capitalisation of maintainable earnings.  We have performed a review of recent share trading history to provide additional evidence of the fair market value of the BRL Shares.
 
We believe it is appropriate to consider recent share trading as a crosscheck as BRL is a large public company whose shares trade on the ASX and are highly liquid.  The company is also subject to extensive analysis by brokers and is required to make ongoing disclosures regarding its operations prospects and activities.  As a result, it is likely that the BRL share price prior to the announcement of the Proposed Schemes reflects all material information about the company.
 
We have considered the discounted cash flow method, however, in view of the unavailability of longer-term reliable cash flow forecasts and the nature of BRL's operations we did not consider this method to be appropriate.
 
We consider the net assets on a going concern basis to be an inappropriate method as the business generates returns justifying values in excess of assets values which can only be reasonably estimated using market based or income based methods.
 
Constellation shares
 
In our analysis of the market value of the Constellation Shares, we have referred to the recent share trading history for similar reasons set out above. Constellation's shares are highly liquid, trade on the NYSE and are subject to in-depth analysis by brokers.  We have also considered the pro-forma financial statements of the Combined Entity.
 
We believe that the share market value of a Constellation share is the appropriate basis to apply in the assessment of the value of the Scrip Consideration as the value of the Constellation share can only be realised by trading that share on the relevant stock exchange.

VALUATION OF BRL
 
8.1         
Introduction
 
In this section we have estimated the fair market value of a BRL Share using the capitalisation of future maintainable earnings method. We have also conducted an analysis of recent trading in BRL Shares as a cross-check to our valuation.
 
8.2         
Capitalisation of maintainable earnings method
 
To value BRL Shares on a full control basis using this method requires an estimate of the following variables:
 
an estimate of future maintainable earnings;
 - 
                                         
 
appropriate valuation multiples;
 - 
                                         
 
the amount of net debt; and
 - 
                                         
 
an appropriate control premium.
 - 
                                         
 
Our consideration of each of these items is discussed below.
 
8.2.1       Future maintainable earnings
 
Future maintainable earnings represent the level of maintainable earnings that the existing business could reasonably be expected to earn based on current operations.  We have selected EBIT and EBITDA as appropriate measures of future maintainable earnings.  In our opinion, these earnings measures allow for a better comparison with earnings multiples of other companies in the same or similar industry segments than measures based on net profit after tax which can be distorted by differing impact of debt gearing, taxation charges and accounting policies on depreciation and amortisation.
 
In arriving at our estimate of future maintainable EBIT and EBITDA we have considered three key factors:
 
BRL's Historical Performance
 
the historical operational and financial performance of BRL for the five year period from 1998 to 2002;
 - 
                                         
 
nature and quantum of any non-recurring and extraordinary items;
 - 
                                         
 
we have conducted interviews with BRL management in the sales and marketing, operations, supply and finance areas in relation to historical and future trends in company profitability; and
 - 
                                         
 
reviewed publicly available information and a range of recent broker reports.
 - 
                                         
Growth prospects
 
performed a review of industry trends, market supply and demand determinants, growth opportunities and expected risks for the Australian and export markets;
 - 
                                         
 
identified the specific factors affecting the operating environment of BRL, including the ongoing rationalisation of wine companies and the retail liquor sectors, supply of grapes, margin pressures and other factors outlined in the industry section of this report;
 - 
                                         
 
identified the specific company strengths, risks, competitive advantages and growth prospects;
 - 
                                         
 
performed financial analysis based on available information for the various geographic segments of the business;
 - 
                                         
 
considered the source of the historical growth in earnings and the trend in margins; and
 - 
                                         
 
compared BRL's performance to its competitors;
 - 
                                         
 
Risk profile
 
obtained information in respect of the management strategy to address current issues;
 - 
                                         
 
considered management plans in relation to the management of future inventory levels and cash flows;
 - 
                                         
 
considered the exposure of the business to future exchange rate movements in light of its existing and ongoing hedging policy; and
 - 
                                         
 
reviewed the relative contribution of the various geographic segments and reviewed the marketing strategies for the different markets.
 - 
                                         
 
Based upon the above analysis we have estimated the future maintainable EBIT and EBITDA to be:
 
Table 38
 
 
 
Source: BRL Annual reports, Deloitte Corporate Finance estimates
 
 
8.2.2       Earnings multiple
 
We have estimated the appropriate earnings multiples (on a minority interest basis) to be in the range of:
 
11.0 to 11.5 times EBITDA; and
 - 
                                         
 
13.0 to 13.5 times EBIT.
 - 
                                         
In selecting these earnings multiples we have considered earnings multiples derived from share market prices of comparable listed companies, multiples implied in recent takeover transactions in the wine sector (taking account of the inclusion of control premiums) and company specific factors relevant to BRL.
 
Share market trading multiples
 
The share market valuation of comparable listed companies provides reasonable evidence of an appropriate earnings multiple for BRL.  The share price of listed companies represents the market value of a minority interest in a company.
 
In selecting appropriate comparable companies we have:
 
had regard to companies which operate in the wine sector worldwide;
 - 
                                         
 
narrowed the range of comparable companies to those operating in the Australian market as they are considered to be most relevant; and
 - 
                                         
 
selected a set of directly comparable companies.
 - 
                                         
 
Having performed a global company search and selected predominantly wine companies, we have selected a range of broadly comparable companies, operating in different regions.  We have identified significant differences in the trends of those companies, their range of operations, the market forces influencing their performance and the accounting standards applied in generating their reported results, which impact their effective multiples. Further, we have observed that the Australian companies trade at relatively similar multiples as opposed to the wide range observed in other regions. The Australian multiples are relatively higher than the rest of the sample as a result of the generally higher growth profile of Australian wine producers.
 
The table below summarises the comparable companies worldwide.

Note:

Excludes Cranswick Premium Wines Ltd as the multiples have been impacted by the ongoing merger with Evans & Tate.
(2)
Based on pro-forma statements as set out in the Explanatory Statement of the proposed merger.
In selecting the appropriate set of comparable companies, we had particular regard to the share market multiples of the Australian comparable companies for the following reasons:
 
the Australian comparable companies operate and compete in the most similar environment to BRL, both domestically and internationally;
 - 
                                        
 
the Australian companies are known for their unique position on the world wine market, due to the large volume of local production and strong export orientation; and
 - 
                                        
 
the industry dynamics, risks and opportunities encountered by the Australian companies more closely mirrors those experienced by its Australian peers rather than the overseas comparable companies.
 - 
                                        
 
We have analysed the share market trading multiples of those companies that we consider comparable to BRL.  Although we have presented the entire set of publicly listed wine companies in Australia, we have placed much greater emphasis on the pure wine companies, which are considered to be more directly comparable to BRL than the larger and diversified ones, such as Fosters and Lion Nathan, whose multiples are affected by the beer and other spirits component of their activities.
 
We have excluded certain companies in estimating the average multiples, due to the abnormal impact on their results and potential comparability due to completed or ongoing merger activities.
 
We have had regard to the difference in size of the comparable companies, their current and historical performance, compared to BRL.
 
We have considered the historical and the forecast multiples for BRL and the selected comparable companies. Excluding relatively short lived peaks in share price, BRL Shares have traded in a range of 10 to 14 times historic EBIT and 14 to 16 times historic EBITDA.
 
The companies we consider most directly comparable, together with their earnings multiples, are summarised in the following table.

6 Excludes Fosters Group Limited and Lion Nathan Limited.
 
General comments regarding the Australian comparable companies are presented in Appendix 1.
Merger and acquisition multiples
 
The acquisition price in mergers or acquisitions of comparable companies provides evidence of an appropriate earnings multiple for the value of BRL on a control basis.  The acquisition price of companies represents the market value of a controlling interest in a company.  The difference between the market value of a controlling interest and a minority interest is referred to as the premium for control.
 
We have compiled merger and acquisition multiples of Australian transactions which are summarised in the following table.

Details of the above transactions are set out in Appendix 2.
Our observations regarding the multiples are summarised below:
 
takeover premiums implied by merger and acquisitions may include a specific purchaser premium over and above the general control premium;
 - 
                                         
 
the older transactions were subject to different factors impacting market sentiment and the industry outlook.  As a result, the takeover premiums appear comparatively high in comparison to current sector conditions;
 - 
                                         
 
as takeover premiums vary significantly across the set of comparable transactions which have been selected, we have placed a greater weighting on the most similar companies in terms of size, growth prospects, maturity of operations, exposure to export markets and other characteristics;
 - 
                                         
 
the majority of the companies acquired in the Australian market were significantly smaller than BRL; and
 - 
                                         
 
the potential special purchaser benefits potentially priced into these transactions may differ from those that might apply to BRL.
 - 
                                         
 
8.2.3       Conclusion  Earnings multiple
 
Based on the above analysis, we are of the opinion that the appropriate EBITDA multiple is in the range of 11 to 11.5 times and the appropriate EBIT multiple is in the range of 13 to 13.5 times.  These multiples have been estimated on a minority interest basis.
 
In reaching our opinion we have taken account of the preceding analysis and the following factors:
 
BRL is much larger than most of the comparable pure wine companies in terms of revenue and enterprise value;
 - 
                                        
 
the comparative historical performance and margins of BRL are in line with the selected set of companies and although BRL has lower margins, it has achieved higher growth;
 - 
                                        
 
BRL has a comparatively strong position both in the Australian market and the export markets, such as Europe and US;
 - 
                                        
 
BRL has outlined its strategy for growth in the respective markets, which is supported by its historical performance; and
 - 
                                        
 
the growth potential expected in regard to PWP, may support a higher multiple. As the joint venture is in its early stage of operations, the potential upside is quite significant. Whilst the selected maintainable earnings do not necessarily allow for the full potential of the joint venture, we have incorporated the expected growth potential of the joint venture in the selection of the multiple.
 - 
                                        
8.2.4       Control premium
 
Earnings multiples derived from share market trading of shares do not reflect the market value for control of a company as they are for portfolio holdings.  Australian studies indicate the premiums required to obtain control of companies range between 25% and 40% of the portfolio holding value.
 
In addition, the average control premiums paid in the mergers and acquisitions of comparable companies as set out in Table 39 was around 20% of the pre-offer share price, however, after excluding outliers, the average moves towards 25%.
 
In our valuation of BRL we have applied a premium for control of 25% primarily based on the observed control premiums in the wine sector.
 
8.2.5       Surplus assets
 
We have considered surplus assets, such as inventories and investments and have come to the following conclusions:
 
current inventory levels, which are in excess of the normal levels required for the business, have been considered in light of the strategy for dealing with the inventory surplus.  We have taken account of the impact of excess inventory levels in our assessment of the net debt for BRL;
 - 
                                         
 
investments in associate companies and other financial assets generate income which is incorporated in our estimate of maintainable earnings; and
 - 
                                         
 
the investment in PWP and its impact on value has been incorporated in the maintainable earnings and its high growth potential has been reflected in the selected multiple.
 - 
                                         
 
8.2.6       Net debt
 
In order to determine the appropriate net debt we have taken into account the following:
 
the estimated debt as at 31 December 2002;
 - 
                                         
 
the seasonality of debt requirements throughout the year;
 - 
                                         
 
the debt associated with the relatively higher inventory levels at 31 December 2002; and
 - 
                                         
 
the estimated cash balance as at 31 December 2002.
 - 
                                         
 
Based on the above, we have estimated that the net debt of BRL is approximately $550 million.
 
8.2.7       Valuation: Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings method
 
The value of BRL derived from the capitalisation of future maintainable earnings method is summarised below.

Recent share price trading
 
We set out in the following table a summary of the recent closing share price for BRL Shares.
 
Table 43
 
 
Source: Bloomberg.
Notes:
(1)  Average based on daily closing prices.
Further comments in relation to the historical share price of BRL are set out in Section 4.5.  The following BRL Shares have been issued in the past few years:
 
              on 23 October 2001 made a renounceable rights issue to BRL Shareholders on a 1 for 10 basis at an issue price of $9.30 per new share, representing approximately an 11% discount to the closing price on that day.  Under the rights issue 15.58 million shares were issued, raising $141.4 million (net of transaction costs);
 - 
 
              during the period 23 May 2000 to 9 August 2000, 4.14 million shares were issued at an average price of $6.41 per share as consideration for the acquisition of shares in Nobilo;
 - 
 
              BRL operates a dividend reinvestment plan under which BRL Shareholders may elect to have all or part of their dividends satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares at a 5% discount to the market price in lieu of receiving cash dividends; and
 - 
 
              at various times during the past few years, shares have been allotted to employees in connection with the exercise of options that were issued under the Employee Option Plan.
 - 
 
Whilst historical issues of shares may provide some market evidence of the BRL share price, it should be borne in mind that these issues were made in different stock market trading conditions.  As discussed previously, BRL's share price has declined by approximately 36% since the beginning of 2002.  We have therefore placed greater weight on more recent trading data.
 
Based on the average closing price for the one month to 9 January 2003 and the closing price on 13 January 2003, we have selected a range of share prices between $7.00 and $7.50 on a minority basis.  Accordingly, our valuation under the capitalisation of maintainable earnings approach of $9.76 to $10.77 implies a premium in the range of approximately 42% over recent share price trading.  This premium is considered reasonable in light of market concerns regarding factors impacting BRL's short term prospects on recent BRL share trading and the 25% control premium included in our valuation range.
 
8.4         
Valuation conclusion
 
We have estimated the fair market value of a BRL share to be in the range of $9.76 to $10.77 inclusive of a premium for control.

VALUATION OF BRL OPTIONS
 
9.1         
Overview
 
BRL has issued a series of unlisted share options pursuant to Employee Option Plan.  Each option entitles the holder to purchase one fully paid ordinary share in BRL at the option exercise price.
 
The options require certain preconditions to be met prior to exercise and then are generally not able to be exercised earlier than 36 months after issue.  When an employee ceases employment with BRL and all other preconditions have been met, the option may be exercised at any time prior to the expiry date.
 
As at 31 December 2002, BRL had 11,660,868 options on issue, which includes 92,818 non-executive director options.  The details are set out below.
 
Table 44
 
 
 
Source: BRL Hardy Limited, Appendix 3B, 3/11/02, BRL Share and Option Register, 23 December 2002.
 
The above table excludes 92,818 non-executive director options with an exercise price of $8.08 expiring on 23 September 2007, which are not included in the Option Scheme.
 
9.2         
Valuation methodology and assumptions
 
We have utilised the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the share options.  In estimating the fair market value of the options we have made the following assumptions:
 
              BRL's share price has been adjusted to take account of the present value of the expected dividends that are expected to be paid out during the life of the options; and
 - 
 
              we have assumed that the conversion date will not occur prior to the expiry date of the option.
 - 
 
In addition, we have incorporated the fair market value of the Optionholders entitlements to additional shares as a result of the rights issue as at 19 September 2001, which constitute the right to acquire one additional share at $9.30 for every ten options exercised.  We have assumed that these rights lapse at the same date as the underlying option.
9.3         
Valuation inputs
 
The following inputs were used to value the various options issued by BRL:

Our considerations regarding the more significant inputs are set out below.
 
9.3.1       Volatility
 
Taking into account the historical volatility of BRL's listed shares and the ASX 300 Food and Beverage Index, we have estimated the volatility of the underlying BRL share price to be between 25% to 30% per annum.
 
9.3.2       Discount for lack of marketability
 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model assumes that there is a liquid market for the options.  We have applied a discount for lack of marketability to the value of the options to reflect that the options are unlisted, not assignable or transferable, contain performance preconditions and are not readily tradeable.
 
In practice, and from a review of restricted stock studies, discounts for lack of marketability range between 10% and 40%.  A discount for lack of marketability of between nil to 30%, was selected to discount the value of each option.
 
9.4         
Valuation of the share options
 
Based on the above assumptions and methodology, the value of each class of option is outlined in the table below.
 
Table 46
 
 
As detailed in the table above, the Option consideration offered by Constellation is at a significant premium to the values derived by us for each series of options, except for those options with an exercise price of $10.13.  Our evaluation of the Option Scheme is set out in Section 11 of this report.

VALUATION OF CONSTELLATION SHARES
 
10.1       
Background
 
BRL Shareholders who elect to receive the Scrip Consideration in part or in whole will receive entitlements to Constellation shares.  As stated in Section 7, we consider the most appropriate methodology to value Constellation shares for the purposes of assessing the Scrip Consideration is to have regard to Constellation's recent share market trading in its Class A Shares.
 
The share price represents a minority interest value for a Constellation share.  If the Share Scheme is approved and implemented, BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration will receive minority interest parcels of Constellation shares.  For this reason, we have not considered any premium for control in valuing Constellation shares as this premium may not be realised in the foreseeable future.
 
10.2       
Recent share market trading
 
Summarised in the table below are the recent daily trades in Constellation's Class A shares.

13 January 2003).  On 20 September 2002, the closing share price of Constellation decreased by approximately 13% to US$25.  It is not clear from the financial press why this market correction occurred, aside from the period coinciding with the pending release of Constellation's second quarter results, which may not have met market expectations.
When adjusted for share splits, Constellation's Class A share price has generally traded between US$10 to US$13 for the period March 2000 to February 2001, before trending upwards (refer Figure 14).  Constellation's Class A shares reached a high of US$32 during the June 2002 quarter, before decreasing by approximately 25 % to current trading levels of US$25.13 (
 
The broader ASX 300 Food and Beverage Index had decreased by approximately 30% since June 2002.  At the same time BRL Shares reduced approximately 22% over the same period.  The decline in the price of Constellation shares since that time has been similar to that observed in the Australian market for that industry sector.

Notes:  Constellation's stocks have been adjusted for share splits.
 
There is a relatively high volume in the trading activity for Constellation shares with annual turnover in Class A shares equivalent to one and half times the total number of Class A shares on issue.  The trading volumes have increased significantly since March 2001.  In part, this may be attributable to the "two-for-one stock splits" approved in April 2001 and 2002, stock issues and market re-weighting with the addition of Constellation to the S&P MidCap 400 Index.
 
Factors, which may have had an impact on recent trading in Constellation's Class A shares, are detailed in the table below:

Additional comments in relation to the historical share price movements of Constellation are set out in Section 5.9.
10.3       
Analysis of value of Constellation Share
 
Based on the above analysis of recent share market trading activity, in our opinion, the market value of a Constellation Class A share prior to the transaction is in the range of US$23 to US$26.
 
Table 49
 
 
 
Notes:
(1) Includes both Class A and Class B shares.
(2) Based on Constellation's Annual Report, 28 February 2002.
 
The implied earnings multiples illustrate that Constellation shares have been trading at a discount in the order of 5% to 15% compared to the S&P 500 Index and other comparable companies in the wine and beverage sector.  One of the reasons that has been attributed to Constellation trading at a discount was its specific capital structure under which the Class B shares control the majority of the votes in the company.
 
10.4       
Conclusion
 
The above analysis provides a historical analysis of trading in Constellation Class A shares and implied earnings multiples.  In assessing the value of the Scrip Consideration, BRL Shareholders will need to consider the share market price of Constellation Class A shares at the time they vote on the Share Scheme.  This share market price will reflect the market conditions at that time including the share markets assessment of the benefits to Constellation of the acquisition of BRL and any subsequent information released to the market by both Constellation and BRL.

EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED SCHEMES
 
11.1       
Background
 
In forming our opinion as to whether or not the Proposed Schemes are in the best interest of BRL Shareholders and Optionholders we have:
 
              estimated the fair market value of an ordinary share in BRL and compared that value with the consideration to be received by the Shareholders pursuant to the Share Scheme;
 - 
 
              estimated the fair market value of the various options covered by the Option Scheme and compared that value with the Option Consideration to be received by the Optionholders, for each category of options, pursuant to the Option Schemes; and
 - 
 
              compared the advantages and disadvantages of the Proposed Schemes proceeding versus not proceeding, both for BRL Shareholders and Optionholders.
 - 
 
11.2       
Opinion
 
In our opinion:
 
              the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders as a whole; and
 - 
 
              the Option Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Optionholders as a whole.
 - 
 
In forming our opinion, we have considered the likely impact of the Proposed Schemes on the BRL Shareholders and Optionholders as a whole.  We have not considered how the Proposed Schemes may affect individual Shareholders or Optionholders.  Individual members may have different financial circumstances and it is not practicable or possible to consider the implications of the Proposed Schemes on individual BRL Shareholders or Optionholders, as their individual financial circumstances may differ.
 
11.3       
Assessment of the Share Scheme
 
In order to assess whether the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders as a whole, we have had regard to the fairness and reasonableness of the Proposed Scheme.  We have based our opinion on the following:
 
11.3.1     Fairness
 
Under the Share Scheme, the BRL Shareholders can choose from:
 
              Cash Consideration of $10.50 per BRL share;
 - 
 
              Scrip Consideration; and
 - 
 
              any combination of cash and scrip.
 - 
 
In determining whether the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders, we have considered both the Cash Consideration and the Scrip Consideration.
In our opinion, the Cash Consideration offered to BRL Shareholders is fair.
 
This opinion was derived based on the following:
 
              the Cash Consideration represents a significant premium over and above the recent share market price of BRL Shares prior to the announcement of the transaction; and
 - 
 
              the Cash Consideration is within our estimated fair market value range of a BRL Share on a control basis.
 - 
 
Set out in the table below is a comparison of our assessment of the fair market value of a BRL share, recent BRL share market trading data and the Cash Consideration being offered pursuant to the Share Scheme.
 
Table 50
 
 
 
Note:
(1) Based on the volume weighted average price.
 
Assessment of the Scrip Consideration
 
The number of Constellation shares to be issued to BRL shareholders accepting the Scrip Consideration will not be determined until after the date of this report and after the BRL Shareholders have approved the Share Scheme.
 
The number of Constellation shares BRL Shareholders will receive will depend on the average Constellation share price and the average exchange rate during the period leading up to the Second Court Hearing.  This information will be made available to BRL Shareholders prior to the date on which they will need to make their election as to the type of consideration they wish to receive.
 
Based on the terms of the Share Scheme, if the market value of a Constellation Share is between US$22.50 and US$27.50 at that time, BRL Shareholders will receive entitlement to Constellation Shares with an equivalent market value of $10.50 calculated 24 hours prior to the date of the Second Court Hearing.  If the average market value of a Constellation Share for the purpose of the Scrip Consideration calculation falls below US$22.50, the market value of the Scrip Consideration may fall below $10.50.  Conversely, if the average market value of a Constellation Share is above US$27.50, the market value of the Scrip Consideration may exceed $10.50.
The value of the Consideration for BRL Shareholders who elect to receive the Scrip Consideration will also depend upon the movement in the market price of Constellation Shares as well as the US$/A$ exchange rate between the date of the Second Court Hearing and the date the Scrip Consideration is actually received.  If the market value of the Constellation Shares increases or decreases between the date the Scheme is approved and the date when scrip entitlement is received, the market value of the Scrip Consideration will increase or decrease correspondingly.  Similarly, if the Australian dollar appreciates against the United States dollar, the value of the Scrip Consideration in Australian dollars would decrease.
 
The decision to hold Constellation shares represents a separate investment decision which shareholders electing the Scrip Alternative should consider in respect of their individual circumstances.  The market value of Constellation scrip may be volatile due to company specific risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report and Section 6 of the Explanatory Statement as well as market and industry factors which may be beyond Constellation's control.
 
The choice between the Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration will depend on the individual risk preferences of each shareholder, together with the different income tax consequences which arise from accepting either the cash or Scrip Consideration.
 
For the reasons outlined above, it is not possible as at the date of this report to compare in absolute terms our assessment of the value of a BRL Share with the value of the Scrip Consideration.  However, details of the actual value of the Scrip Consideration will be provided to the BRL Shareholders prior to the date on which they will need to lodge their election to receive Scrip.  BRL Shareholders should therefore be able to compare the value of the Scrip Consideration with the Cash Consideration prior to making their election.  In the following section we have outlined some of the reasonableness factors, which will be relevant to shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration.
 
11.3.2     Assessment of reasonableness
 
In our opinion the Share Scheme is reasonable.
 
We have formed our opinion based on comparison of the likely advantages and disadvantages of the Share Scheme if it proceeds, with the likely advantages and disadvantages for the BRL Shareholders if the Share Scheme is not approved.
 
If the Share Scheme proceeds
 
Advantages
 
              Shareholders are able to dispose of their BRL Shares for a cash consideration, which significantly exceeds the recent trading range on the ASX for BRL Shares. The opportunity to realise this value may not be otherwise available for some time, especially for shareholders with large parcels of shares.
 - 
 
              The consideration offered is flexible, offering a choice between Cash and Scrip or any combination thereof, allowing BRL Shareholders to select the type of consideration which best suits their individual circumstances and preferences (subject to any potential scale back of the Scrip Offer as outlined in the Explanatory Statement).
 - 
 
              The Cash Consideration option provides BRL shareholders with certainty over the value of the consideration to be received.
 - 
 
Disadvantages
 
              BRL Shareholders will no longer collectively control BRL or hold a direct interest in the Company.  BRL Shareholders will no longer be able to directly participate in the future growth of BRL to the extent that it may generate a future value above the Share Scheme offer price.
 - 
              Electing the Cash Consideration pursuant to the Share Scheme may crystallise tax liabilities for individual shareholders.  The tax implications of the Proposed Schemes to BRL Shareholders are outlined in Section 10 of the Explanatory Statement.  BRL Shareholders should consult their tax adviser regarding their personal circumstances.
 - 
 
Scrip Consideration
 
In addition to the above factors, BRL shareholders who elect the Scrip Consideration in whole or in part, the following advantages and disadvantages should also be considered.
 
Advantages
 
              The BRL Shareholders will be able to participate in the future growth of the Combined Entity, which will be a leading international wine company and a significant global diversified alcohol group with a significant presence in the US, UK and Australian markets.
 - 
 
              The proposed merger may deliver operational synergies and cost savings that may enhance the operational and financial performance of the combined entity and this may increase the value of Constellation Shares over time (for details refer to Section 6.2 of this report and Section 5.5 of the Explanatory Memorandum).  However, the realisation of these potential synergies will be dependent upon management's ability to successfully integrate the two companies.
 - 
 
              Shareholders may benefit from the income tax roll-over provisions, thus deferring any capital gains tax payable (refer to Section 10.1(d) of the Explanatory Statement detailing taxation consequences).
 - 
 
              Australian resident BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration will be able to trade their Constellation CDI's on the ASX.
 - 
 
Disadvantages and other considerations
 
              The number of Constellation Shares BRL Shareholders will receive will depend on the average Constellation Share price and the US$/A$ exchange rate leading up to the Second Court Hearing.  If the average Constellation Share price is above US$27.50 or below US$22.50, BRL Shareholders will receive Constellation Shares with an equivalent value that may be above or below $10.50.
 - 
 
              The value of the Scrip Consideration to be received by BRL Shareholders may fluctuate due to movements in the price of Constellation Shares or the US$/A$ exchange rate between the date the scrip exchange ratio is set and the date the Scrip Consideration is actually received (6 days based on the proposed transaction timetable).
 - 
              Trading volumes in Constellation CDI's may be less than current trading volumes in BRL Shares and less than the trading volumes in Constellation Shares on the NYSE.  The risk exists that trading in Constellation CDI's may be relatively illiquid and may trade at a discount to the underlying Constellation Share listed on the NYSE.
 - 
 
              Constellation's policy is to retain all of its earnings to finance the development and expansion of the business and it does not anticipate dividend payment in the foreseeable future, unlike BRL, who has consistently paid fully franked dividends to shareholders.
 - 
 
              If Constellation were to pay dividends in the future, they will not be franked for Australian income tax purposes.  Any dividends paid to non-residents of the US may also attract withholding tax in the US.
 - 
 
              BRL Shareholders electing to receive the Scrip Consideration will be exposed to different investment risks and returns.  BRL is predominantly a wine company, whilst the Combined Entity will be significantly different in terms of product mix, geographic coverage and contractual exposure.
 - 
 
              BRL Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration will be exposed to the volatility of the price of the Constellation Share and Constellation CDI's which is related to company specific risk factors (see details in Section 6 of the Explanatory Statement) and factors beyond the control of Constellation, such as general market trends.
 - 
 
              If the Share Scheme proceeds, Constellation will incur substantial additional debt to finance the merger.  Constellation's ability to meet its financial obligations will be dependent upon its future operating performance as well as general economic conditions in key markets, future interest rates and other factors beyond the company's control.
 - 
 
              Shareholders electing the Scrip Consideration will have a lower percentage shareholding in Constellation relative to BRL.  Constellation also has a controlling shareholder group, the Sands family, who collectively control approximately 58% of the voting rights.
 - 
 
              Ownership of Constellation CDI's provides an indirect interest in Constellation Class A shares, which does not provide all the benefits that accrue from a direct shareholding in Constellation (for details refer to other considerations outlined below and Section 7 of the Explanatory Statement).
 - 
 
              The amount of shareholders accepting CDI's may be very small.
 - 
 
If the Proposed Share Scheme is NOT approved
 
Advantages
 
              The BRL Shareholders will continue to collectively control BRL.
 - 
 
              BRL Shares will remain listed on the ASX and the company will continue to pursue its business strategy in accordance with its stated objectives. Shareholders will be entitled to any benefits including dividends and share value growth derived from the ongoing activities.
 - 
 
              BRL Shareholders may receive alternative offers for BRL.  However, the existence of the PWP joint venture and the existing relationship with Constellation, although technically not preventing any transaction, may deter other potential purchasers from making an alternative offer.
 - 
Disadvantages
 
 
              BRL Shareholders will not receive the consideration offered in the Share Scheme.
 - 
 
              BRL's share price which has increased significantly following the announcement of the Share Scheme and is likely to decline in the short term if the Share Scheme is not approved.
 - 
 
              BRL's future outlook may be less favourable than the Combined Entity's future outlook due to the potential synergies and other strategic benefits that might have arisen in the Combined Entity, which will not be realised if the Proposed Scheme does not proceed.
 - 
 
              BRL Shareholders will be exposed to the risks of BRL not achieving its target performance as a stand alone entity operating in a highly competitive environment internationally.
 - 
 
Alternative bidders
 
The Proposed Scheme was announced on 17 January 2003.  The Directors of BRL have confirmed that there have not been any alternative offers since this date and that they are not aware of any alternative offers that may be forthcoming.
 
If a superior alternative offer emerges prior to the meeting to approve the Share Scheme, BRL Shareholders will be able to vote against the Share Scheme.
 
11.4       
Assessment of the Option Scheme
 
The Option Scheme is conditional upon the approval of the Share Scheme and will not proceed unless the Share Scheme is approved.
 
We have concluded above that the Share Scheme is in the best interest of BRL Shareholders.  Most of the considerations applicable to BRL Shareholders are also applicable to Optionholders.
 
11.4.1     Fairness
 
In our opinion, the Option Scheme is, on balance, fair to the Optionholders as a whole.
 
This opinion was based on the following:
 
              the Option Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium over the estimated market value of most of the options on issue (except for the options at an exercise price of $10.13);
 - 
 
              the majority of the Optionholders with an exercise price of $10.13 hold other BRL options which results in the value of the Option Scheme Consideration exceeding the assessed fair market value of all the options held; and
 - 
 
              the Optionholders who hold only options with an exercise price of $10.13 and no other options only hold approximately 2.5% of this series of Options.  Although the Option Scheme Consideration is below the estimated fair market value range for these options, we believe that for those Optionholders, it is relevant to consider the reasonableness factors arising from the Option Scheme in the absence of an alternative offer.
 - 
Our assessment of value is summarised in the table below.
 
Table 51
 
 
The additional leverage offered by options means that the premium inherent in the Option Scheme is higher than the Share Scheme.  The majority of the Option holders will receive a premium above the current value of their options of between 85 % and 130% if the Option Scheme proceeds.
 
11.4.2     Reasonableness
 
In our opinion, the Option Scheme is reasonable to the Optionholders as a whole.
 
If the Option Scheme is approved
 
Advantages
 
              Optionholders will be able to dispose of their Options.  As some of the Scheme Options are neither listed on a stock exchange nor assignable or tradeable, holders of non-vested options have limited opportunity to dispose of their options.  Acceptance of the Option Scheme Consideration relieves the Optionholders of having to meet certain vesting periods before their Options can be exercised.
 - 
              The Option Scheme provides certainty of value to be realised by the Optionholders and a significant premium above the assessed value per option (excluding those holding options with an exercise price of $10.13).
 - 
 
Disadvantages
 
              Optionholders will no longer have the opportunity to participate in any potential increase in BRL's share price over and above the implied premium for each series of options.
 - 
 
              The Option Scheme may crystallise income tax liabilities for individual Optionholders.
 - 
If the Option Scheme is NOT approved
 
              Any tax liabilities will be deferred until the time the Optionholders choose to dispose of their options.
 - 
 
              If the Shareholder Scheme is approved, BRL Shares will be delisted.  Accordingly, options would be convertible into a minority shareholding in an unlisted entity.  The market value of these shares would be highly uncertain because of their lack of liquidity.
 - 
 
              Constellation will be in a position to compulsory acquire the unlisted options or BRL Shares that Optionholders would receive from exercising their options under Chapter 6A of the Corporations Act.
 - 
 
              the Optionholders may miss the opportunity of obtaining a significant premium over the fair market value for their options.

APPENDIX 1: 
COMPARABLE COMPANIES
 
Australian wine producers
 
We have identified eight publicly listed companies that operate in the Australian wine industry that are comparable with BRL.  The following comments relate to the operations, historical growth and activities of the selected companies.
 
Lion Nathan Ltd ("Lion Nathan")
 
              Lion Nathan is a large Australian brewing company with four breweries.  The company produces Castlemaine XXXX in Brisbane, Swan in Perth, West End in Adelaide and Tooheys in Sydney;
 - 
 
              Lion Nathan is 47% owned by Kirin Brewery Co Ltd;
 - 
 
              the Company has yet to develop a national brand, although, it has recently embarked on a nationwide campaign to promote Hahn;
 - 
 
              the company has recently invested in the wine industry through the acquisition of Banksia Wines and Petaluma.  Presently wine sales account for approximately 5% of total sales. The wines produced by Banksia and Petaluma are targeted at the premium end of the market;
 - 
 
              Lion Nathan expects that its future growth will be driven by its wine division and plans to expand its wine business by acquiring other assets in Australia and New Zealand;
 - 
 
              the company also has brewing operations in China; and
 - 
 
              in the last financial year the company had sales of $1.7 billion and net profit of $162 million.
 - 
 
Fosters Group Limited ("Fosters")
 
              Fosters is Australia's largest diversified alcoholic beverage company, with the majority of revenues derived from beer and wine production and distribution.  The company also distributes spirits and owns a large number of pubs;
 - 
 
              the company's brewing arm is Carlton & United Breweries which produces a number of major brands such as Crown Lager, Fosters, Cascade and VB.  The Fosters brand is well known internationally;
 - 
 
              Fosters' wine business has grown significantly mainly because of its acquisition of Beringer Wine Estates in the US in 2000.  Wine sales accounted for approximately 41% of total sales; and
 - 
 
              In 2002 Fosters had sales of $4.5 billion and a net profit of $566 million.
 - 
 
Southcorp Limited ("Southcorp")
 
              Southcorp is a top 50 listed company that is engaged in the production and distribution of wines.  In recent times, Southcorp has transformed itself into a pure wine producer by divesting of a number of its manufacturing assets.  The sale proceeds sale of these assets were used to reduce debt;
 - 
 
              during 2001 Southcorp acquired Rosemount Estate.  Today Southcorp is considered the world's largest premium brand wine company.  Its key brands include Penfolds, Rosemount Estate, Lindemans and Wynns.  The company has plans to grow its higher premium portfolio, and in particular the Penfolds brand.  The key brands account for approximately 60% of Southcorp's total sales;
 - 
 
              the company has 15,000 acres of vineyards that are located in the Coonawarra and other wine regions across Australia.  The company sells approximately 20 million cases per annum;
 - 
 
              export sales represents 60% of Southcorp's revenue.  The company supports its export program through an extensive distribution network.   Major overseas markets include North America and Europe; and
 - 
 
              Southcorp's revenue declined by 30% during 2002 due to the divestment of a number of manufacturing businesses. Despite the overall decline in revenue, Southcorp's wine business experienced a 13.2% increase in revenue.  Market analysts have forecast Southcorp's wine sales to increase to $1.7 billion during 2003.
 - 
 
McGuigan Simeon Wines Limited ("McGuigan")
 
              McGuigan is an entity that is primarily engaged in the production and marketing of wine and managing and developing vineyards.  The company formed after the merger of McGuigan Wines and Simeon Wines.  The merger was facilitated by Simeon Wines' desire to move from its position as a purely toll wine juice producer to a branded wine producer;
 - 
 
              prior to the merger, Simeon Wines produced approximately 13% of Australian wines under long-term contracts to other wine companies. They also managed various vineyards on behalf of Orlando;
 - 
 
              after the completion of the merger McGuigan will have 10,000 acres of grapes under management and control, making it the second largest vineyard owner in Australia.  The company has the capacity to crush 180,000 tonnes per annum;
 - 
 
              Simeon Wines' revenue was derived solely in the Australian market, while 65% of McGuigan wines were sold locally.  McGuigan has plans to grow its domestic market share by introducing new packaging and new products (such as fortified wines);
 - 
 
              approximately 48% of McGuigan's total production, or 35% of total revenue, was sold into international markets.  McGuigan's major export market was UK ($18 million per annum), US ($9 million per annum) and New Zealand ($4.5 million per annum).  During 2002, sales to UK and New Zealand increased, while sales to the US remained constant.  The merged company will continue to develop its overseas markets, and is expected to export to over 20 countries; and
 - 
 
              McGuigan's historical trading multiples are significantly higher than its competitors.  The company's merger occurred on 21 June 2002, so its financial results do not incorporate the financial impact of its merger with Simeon Wines.  Market analysts forecast the merged group's revenue to be $260 million for the 2003 financial year.
 - 
Peter Lehmann Wines ("Peter Lehmann")
 
              Peter Lehmann is a listed Australian wine producer located in the Barossa Valley, South Australia.  The company produces a wide range of white, red and fortified wines.  The company's popular ranges include Clancy's, Cellar Door and Weighbridge, which was recently launched in the UK market;
 - 
 
              the company experienced a 7% increase in revenue during 2002, which has been attributed to increased domestic and international sales.  The growth attributable to Peter Lehmann is considered organic, as the company has not been acquisitive.  Market commentators expect Peter Lehmann's sales to increase to $52 million in 2003;
 - 
 
              the company ceased production for two of the three companies they were representing during 2002;
 - 
 
              export sales increased by 16% during 2002.  The UK market is Peter Lehmann's largest single export market, accounting for 30% of total branded case sales. Sales to European markets represented 43% of the company's total sales; and
 - 
 
              the company's EBIT margin was 23% during 2002, which is consistent with industry averages.
 - 
 
Evans & Tate Limited ("Evans & Tate")
 
              Evans & Tate is an Australian company engaged in the production and sale of wines from the Margaret River region in Western Australia;
 - 
 
              the company sells a range of branded wines, which include Oakridge Vineyard, Gnamgara and the Margaret River ranges.  It also provides non-branded wine production services to local and international customers;
 - 
 
              Evans & Tate's wine production accounted for approximately 30% of the Margaret River's output or 600,000 cases.  The company's production is expected to increase to  1 million cases by 2006;
 - 
 
              during 2002 Evans & Tate generated revenue of $31 million, making it the second smallest comparable company in terms of revenue.  The company's revenue is forecast to increase to $35 million during 2003.  Evans & Tate's EBIT margin of 24% is consistent with the average profitability of the comparable companies; and
 - 
 
              during 2002 Evans & Tate acquired Selwyn Viticultural Services and Oakridge Vineyards.  Evans & Tate issued 4.7 million shares ($6.6 million) to fund its acquisition of Oakridge Vineyards.   The company will merge with Cranswick Premium Wines in 2003.
 - 
 
Cranswick Premium Wines Limited ("Cranswick")
 
              Cranswick is an Australian wine producer and owns 1,200 acres of vineyards in Riverina, Riverland, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra;
 - 
 
              the company's generated revenue of $53 million during 2002.  The company's EBIT margin of 7% is significantly lower than the average margin earned by the comparable companies.  Since 2001, Cranswick has undergone a period of low profitability which has been attributed to a large increase in marketing and distribution costs;
 - 
              domestic sales have not grown over the past couple of years.  During 2002 the company's local distributor ceased trading, which is expected to decrease Cranswick's annual revenue by $4 to $5 million per annum;
 - 
 
              Cranswick generates 75% of its sales revenue from exports to 23 countries. The company experienced strong growth in sales to the UK and Europe during 2002. Cranswick distributes its wines to the US via a national broker network and has recently launched products into Asia;
 - 
 
              overall, market analysts forecast the company's sales to increase to $65 million during 2003; and
 - 
 
              Cranswick's historical trading multiple is 22 times EBIT, which is higher than the average historical trading multiples of comparable companies.  The EBIT multiple may be attributable to the proposed merger with Evans and Tate which will be completed later in 2003.
 - 
 
Xanadu Wines Limited ("Xanadu")
 
              Xanadu commenced operations approximately 20 years ago. The company is based in Margaret River and is considered a substantial holder of prime land in this region. The company also operates vineyards in McLaren Vale, South Australia;

 - 
 
              the company's annual processing capacity is 3,000 tonnes.  A planned expansion of its local wineries is expected to increase production by 15%;
 - 
 
              Xanadu is the smallest company in terms of enterprise value ($53 million) and sales  ($14 million).  Xanadu has experienced high growth in the past couple of years.  The company's EBIT margin is 23%, which is comparable to the average margin earned by the comparable companies;
 - 
 
              locally, Xanadu entered into a distribution agreement with Casma, the second largest wine distributor in Australia; and
 - 
 
              historically, Xanadu's international strategy has been to concentrate on the UK market.  More recently the company has further developed its presence in the US, Canadian, European and Asian markets. The company expects to export 60% of its production by 2003.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
 
To Constellation Brands, Inc.:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2002 and February 28, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2002 and February 28, 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

             SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
1.
 
Description of business -
Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry. The Company is a leader in the production and marketing of beverage alcohol brands in
North America and the United Kingdom. The Company is the largest single-source supplier of wine,
imported beer and distilled spirits in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the Company is a leading
producer and marketer of wine and cider, and a leading independent drinks wholesaler. The Company's
products are distributed by more than 1,000 wholesale distributors in North America. In the United
Kingdom, the Company distributes its branded products and those of other companies to more than
16,
500 customers.
 
Principles of consolidation -
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Constellation
Brands, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Management's use of estimates and judgment -
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Foreign currency translation -
The "functional currency" for translating the accounts of the Company's operations outside the U
.S. is the local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is
performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the period. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.
 
Cash investments -
Cash investments consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased
of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates market value. The amounts at February
28, 2002, were not significant. At February 28, 2001, cash investments consist of investments in
commercial paper of $141.0 million, which were classified as held-to-maturity.
 
Fair value of financial instruments -
To meet the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
"'Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the Company calculates the fair value of
financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, the Company uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, etc.) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized as
follows:
Accounts receivable:
The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments, the creditworthiness of the customers and the large number of customers constituting
the accounts receivable balance.
Notes payable:
These instruments are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying
value approximates the fair value.
Long-term debt:
The carrying value of the debt facilities with short-term variable interest rates
approximates the fair value. The fair value of the fixed rate debt was estimated by discounting cash flows
using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
Foreign exchange hedging agreements:
The fair value of currency forward contracts is estimated based on quoted market prices.
Letters of credit:
anticipated.
At February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $13.2 million and S12.3 million, respectively, which guarantee payment for certain
obligations. The Company recognizes expense on these obligations as incurred and no material losses are
 
summarized as follows:
The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments are
 
 
Interest rate futures and currency forward contracts -
From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate futures and a variety of currency forward contracts in the management of interest rate risk and foreign currency transaction exposure. The Company
has limited involvement with derivative instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company uses derivatives solely to reduce the financial impact of the related risks. Effective March 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"),
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 133
requires that the Company recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
The Company uses foreign currency exchange agreements to reduce the risk of foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations resulting primarily from contracts to purchase inventory items that are
denominated in various foreign currencies. Certain of these derivative contracts are designated to hedge
the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction and are classified as cash flow hedges. As
such, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded each period in the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss ("AOCI"), and is reclassified into the
statement of income, primarily as a component of cost of product sold, in the same period during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. The currency forward exchange contracts used generally have
maturity terms of twelve months or less. The Company expects the entire balance in AOCI related to
cash flow hedges to be reclassified to the statement of income within the next twelve months. The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items in
accordance with SFAS No. 133 requirements.
The Company uses the remaining foreign currency exchange agreements to reduce the risk of fdenominated in various foreign currencies. As these derivative contracts have not been designated as
oreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting primarily from recorded accounts payable
hedging instruments, all resulting gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the period of change.
 
The Company has exposure to foreign currency risk, primarily in the United Kingdom, as a result
of having international subsidiaries. The Company uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such borrowings are
designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in the foreign operation.
Accordingly, the effective portion of the foreign currency gain or loss on the hedging debt instrument is reported in AOC1 as part of the foreign currency translation adjustments. For fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, net gains of $5.4 million and $20.0 million, respectively, are included in foreign currency translation adjustments within AOCI.
 
Inventories -
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out
method) or market. Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and consist of the following:
 
 
A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of
the duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process
inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice. Bulk wine
inventories are also included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the
general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods
greater than one year. Warehousing, insurance, ad valorem taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.
 
Property, plant and equipment -
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and betterments are charged to
property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. The cost of
properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating
income.
 
Depreciation - -
Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated
useful lives:
 
Amortization of assets capitalized under capital leases is included with depreciation expense.
Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the asset or the lease term.
Other assets -
Other assets, which consist of goodwill, distribution rights, trademarks, agency license
agreements, deferred financing costs, prepaid pension benefits and other amounts, are stated at cost, net of
accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line or effective interest basis over the
following estimated useful lives:
 
 
Long-lived assets and intangibles -
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," the Company reviews
its long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable on an undiscounted
cash flow basis. The statement also requires that, when an impairment has occurred, long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
less cost to sell. The Company recorded an asset impairment of $1.4 million in Fiscal 2002 in connection
with the sale of the Stevens Point Brewery in March 2002.
 
Advertising and promotion costs -
The Company generally expenses advertising and promotion costs as incurred, shown or
distributed. Prepaid advertising costs at February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, were not material.
Advertising and promotion expense for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and
February 29. 2000. were $310.9 million, $264.4 million, and $279.6 million, respectively.
 
Income taxes -
The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The liability method
accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the
difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
 
Environmental -
Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed as appropriate.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to
current or future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or the Company's
commitment to a formal plan of action. Liabilities for environmental costs were not material at February
28, 2002, and February 28, 2001.
 
Comprehensive income -
Comprehensive income consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and net
unrealized gains on derivative instruments and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Stockholders' Equity. See Note 15 for changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive
loss.
Earnings per common share -
Basic earnings per common share excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period for Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible
Common Stock. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that could result if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
Diluted earnings per common share assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method
and assumes the conversion of convertible securities, if any, using the "if converted" method.
 
Commnn stock split -
During April 2002, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of both the
Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock, which will be distributed in
the form of a stock dividend on May 13, 2002, to stockholders of record on April 30, 2002. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to give effect to the common stock split.
 
Other -
Certain February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, balances have been reclassified to conform to

Senior credit facility -
On October 6, 1999, the Company, certain of its principal operating subsidiaries and a syndicate
of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The Chase Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent,
entered into a senior credit facility (as subsequently amended, the "2000 Credit Agreement"). The 2000
Credit Agreement includes both U.S. dollar and British pound sterling commitments of the Syndicate
Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of $1.0 billion (subject to increase as therein provided to $1.2 
billion). Proceeds of the 2000 Credit Agreement were used to repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest on all loans under the Company's prior senior credit facility, and are available to fund permitted acquisitions and ongoing working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries.
 
The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility due in December 2004, a $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility available for borrowing in British pound
sterling due in December 2004, and a $300.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including letters of credit up to a maximum of $20.0 million) which expires in December 2004. The Tranche I Term Loan facility
($380.0 million) and the Tranche II Term Loan facility (193.4 million, or $320.0 million) were fully
drawn at closing. During Fiscal 2001, the Company used proceeds from operating activities to prepay a
portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2002, the Company used
proceeds from the sale of 645,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock (see Note 13) to pay
an additional portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. After these repayments, the
required quarterly repayments of the Tranche I Term Loan facility were revised to $17.4 million for each quarter in 2002, $19.6 million for each quarter in 2003, and $20.0 million for each quarter in 2004. On

After these repayments, the required quarterly repayments of the Tranche II Term Loan facility were
revised to 0.4 million ($0.6 million) for each quarter in 2001 and 2002, 0.5 million ($0.7 million) for
each quarter in 2003, and 8.5 million ($12.0 million) for each quarter in 2004 (the foregoing U.S. dollar
equivalents are as of February 28, 2002). There are certain mandatory term loan prepayments, including
those based on sale of assets and issuance of debt and equity, in each case subject to customary baskets,
exceptions and thresholds.
The rate of interest payable, at the Company's option, is a function of the London interbank
offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin.
The margin is adjustable based upon the Company's Debt Ratio (as defined in the 2000 Credit
Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% for Revolving
Credit loans and 1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans. As of February 28, 2002, the margin was 1.125% for
Revolving Credit loans and 1.625% for Term Loans. In addition to interest, the Company pays a facility f
ee on the Revolving Credit commitments at 0.50% per annum as of February 28, 2002. This fee is based
upon the Company's quarterly Debt Ratio and can range from 0.25% to 0.50%.
 
Certain of the Company's principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed the Company's
obligations under the 2000 Credit
Agreement
. The 2000 Credit Agreement is secured by (i) first priority
pledges of 100% of the capital stock of Canandaigua Limited and all of the Company's domestic
operating subsidiaries and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the capital stock of Matthew Clark and

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants including those
restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness, the sale of assets, the payment of dividends,
transactions with affiliates and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to customary
baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The primary financial covenants require the maintenance of a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
Among
the most restrictive covenants contained in the 2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio.
 
On February 13, 2001, the 2000 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, permit
the Company to finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets with revolving loan
borrowings, permit the refinancing of the Original Notes (as defined below) and Series C Notes (as

These rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.7% over seven years and 4.0% over 3 years for the Non-U.S. and U.S. plans, respectively, and to remain at this level thereafter. Assumed healthcare trend rates could have a significant effect on the amount reported for health care plans. A 1% change in assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
 
 
12.           COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
 
Operating leases -
Future payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows during the next five fiscal years and thereafter:
 
 
Rental expense was $24.0 million, $19.6 million, and $17.4 million for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000, respectively.
 
Purchase commitments and contingencies -
The Company has agreements with suppliers to purchase various spirits of which certain agreements are denominated in British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. The maximum future obligation under these agreements, based upon exchange rates at February 28, 2002, aggregate $19.1 million for contracts expiring through December 2006.
 
All of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements from the suppliers of these products. The Company's agreement to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands exclusively throughout 25 primarily western U.S. states expires in December 2006, with automatic five year renewals thereafter, subject to compliance with certain performance criteria and other terms under the agreement. The remaining agreements expire through June 2008. Prior to their expiration, these agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance criteria. At February 28, 2002, the Company believes it is in compliance with all of its material distribution agreements and, given the Company's long-term relationships with its suppliers, the Company does not believe that these agreements will be terminated.
 
In connection with previous acquisitions as well as with the Turner Road Vintners Assets acquisition and the Corus Assets acquisition, the Company has assumed grape purchase contracts with certain growers and suppliers. In addition, the Company has entered into other grape purchase contracts with various growers and suppliers in the normal course of business. Under the grape purchase contracts, the Company is committed to purchase all grape production yielded from a specified number of acres for a period of time from one to sixteen years. The actual tonnage and price of grapes that must be purchased by the Company will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions and the agricultural practices and location of the growers and suppliers under contract. The Company purchased $177.0 million of grapes under these contracts during Fiscal 2002. Based on current production yields and published grape prices, the Company estimates that the aggregate purchases under these contracts over the remaining term of the contracts will be $785.3 million.
 
In connection with the Turner Road Vintners Assets acquisition and the Corus Assets acquisition, the Company established a reserve for the estimated loss on firm purchase commitments assumed at the time of acquisition of $52.6 million.
 
The Company's aggregate obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts will be $25.0 million over the remaining term of the contracts which expire through fiscal 2005.
Employment contracts -
The Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive officers and certain other management personnel with automatic one year renewals unless terminated by either party. These agreements provide for minimum salaries, as adjusted for annual increases, and may include incentive bonuses based upon attainment of specified management goals. In addition, these agreements provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment. The aggregate commitment for future compensation and severance, excluding incentive bonuses, was $4.8 million as of February 28, 2002, of which none was accrued as of February 28, 2002.
 
Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements -
Approximately 29% of the Company's full-time employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements at February 28, 2002. Agreements expiring within one year cover approximately 10% of the Company's full-time employees.
 
Legal matters -
The Company is subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management such liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
3.             STOCKHOLDERS'EQUITY:
 
Common stock -
The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If the Company pays a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.
 
At February 28, 2002, there were 76,413,648 shares of Class A Common Stock and 12,105,490 shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding, net of treasury stock.
 
Stock repurchase authorization -
In June 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. The Company may finance such purchases, which will become treasury shares, through cash generated from operations or through the senior credit facility. No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000
 
Equity offerings -
During March 2001, the Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This resulted in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets.
During October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of Class A Common Stock by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility.
 
Long-term stock incentive plan -
Under the Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards may be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company. At the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 20, 1999, stockholders approved the amendment to the Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares of the Class A Common Stock available for awards under the plan from 16,000,000 shares to 28,000,000 shares. The exercise price, vesting period and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the "Committee"). Grants of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting, terms, conditions and other requirements as the Committee may establish. During Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, no stock appreciation rights were granted. No restricted stock was granted during Fiscal 2002. During Fiscal 2001, 15,100 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock were granted at a weighted average grant date fair value of $13.31 per share.
 
Incentive stock option plan -
Under the Company's Incentive Stock Option Plan, incentive stock options may be granted to employees, including officers, of the Company. Grants, in the aggregate, may not exceed 4,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The exercise price of any incentive stock option may not be less than the fair market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting period and term of incentive stock options granted are established by the Committee. The maximum term of incentive stock options is ten years.
 
A summary of stock option activity under the Company's long-term stock incentive plan and the incentive stock option plan is as follows:
 
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at February 28, 2002:
 
 
The weighted average fair value of options granted during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000 was $8.99, $5.45, and $6.57, respectively. The fair value of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 4.7% for Fiscal 2002, 6.2% for Fiscal 2001, and 5.7% for Fiscal 2000; volatility of 41.0% for Fiscal 2002, 38.8% for Fiscal 2001, and 40.0% for Fiscal 2000; and expected option life of 6.0 years for Fiscal 2002, 4.7 years for Fiscal 2001, and 7.0 years for Fiscal 2000. The dividend yield was 0% for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
 
Employee stock purchase plans -
The Company has a stock purchase plan under which 4,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued. Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period. During Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001. and Fiscal 2000, employees purchased 120,674 shares, 147,776 shares, and 124,248 shares, respectively.
 
The weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000 was $5.59, $3.78, and $3.04, respectively. The fair value of purchase rights is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 2.6% for Fiscal 2002, 5.7% for Fiscal 2001, and 5.4% for Fiscal 2000: volatility of 33.2% for Fiscal 2002, 36.8% for Fiscal 2001, and 33.6% for Fiscal 2000; expected purchase right life of 0.5 years for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000. The dividend yield was 0% for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000.
 
The Company has a stock purchase plan under which 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock may be issued to eligible employees and directors of the Company's United Kingdom subsidiaries. Under the terms of the plan, participants may purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price may be no less than 80% of the closing price of the stock on the day the purchase price is fixed by the committee administering the plan. As of February 28, 2002, no shares have been issued.
 
Pro forma disclosure -
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its plans. The Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123"). Accordingly, no incremental compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans. Had the Company recognized the compensation cost based upon the fair value at the date of grant for awards under its plans consistent with the
 
methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per common share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts as follows:
 
 
The pro forma effect on net income may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.
 
14.           EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:
 
The following table presents earnings per common share as follows:
 
 
Stock options to purchase 2.2 million, 1.1 million and 0.3 million shares of Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $20.70, $13.93 and $14.82 were outstanding during the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively, but were not included in the computation of the diluted earnings per common share because the stock options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Stock for the respective periods.
15.           ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS:
 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the following components:
 
 
16.           RELATED PARTIES:
 
Agustin Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fine Wine segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various family owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions with the Fine Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2002. The Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the exclusive distributor of its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell grapes to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long-term contracts; participate as partners with the Fine Wine segment in the ownership and operation of a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and other consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally to the Fine Wine segment and the Company. Total payments to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $4.8 million, $5.0 million, and $3.2 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. In addition, the Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus Interests. Total fees received from the Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for these services totaled $0.4 million, $0.6 million, and $0.6 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. As of February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, the net amounts due to/from the Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant.
 
17.          SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:
 
Gross sales to the five largest customers of the Company represented 19.1%, 17.6%, and 17.1% of the Company's gross sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. No single customer was responsible for greater than 10% of gross sales during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000. Accounts receivable from the Company's largest customer, Southern Wine and Spirits, represented 10.0%, 9.8%, and 8.6% of the Company's total accounts receivable as of February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively. Gross sales to the Company's five largest customers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of the Company's revenues. The Company's arrangements with certain of its customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial position, and management of the Company is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of customers and geographic sales area.
 
18.           CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
 
subsidiaries of the Company which are not Subsidiary Guarantors, primarily Matthew Clark, which is included in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment ("Subsidiary Nonguarantors").  The Subsidiary Guarantors are wholly owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors.  Separate financial statements for the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Company are not presented because the Company has determined that such financial statements would not be material to investors.  The Subsidiary Guarantors comprise all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, other than Matthew Clark, the Company's Canadian subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries which individually, and in the aggregate, are inconsequential.  The accounting policies of the subsidiaries are the same as those described in Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  There are no restrictions on the ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.
The following information sets forth the condensed consolidating balance sheets of the Company as of February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, and the condensed consolidating statements of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 28, 2002, for the C'ompany, the parent company, the combined subsidiaries of the Company which guarantee the Company's senior notes and senior subordinated notes ("Subsidiary Guarantors") and the combined
 
 
 
 
19            BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:
 
The Company reports its operating results in five segments: Popular and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine, cider and bottled water, and wholesale wine, cider, distilled spirits, beer and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super-premium and ultra-premium wine) and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items). Segment selection was based upon internal organizational structure, the way in which these operations are managed and their performance evaluated by management and the Company's Board of Directors, the availability of separate financial results, and materiality considerations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.   The Company evaluates performance based on operating profits of the respective business units.
 
Segment information is as follows:
 
The Company's areas of operations are principally in the United States. Operations outside the United States consist of the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's operations, which are primarily in the United Kingdom. No other single foreign country or geographic area is significant to the consolidated operations.
 
20.           NONRECURRING CHARGES:
 
During Fiscal 2000, the Company incurred nonrecurring charges of $5.5 million related to the closure of a cider production facility within the U.K. Brands and Wholesale operating segment in the United Kingdom ($2.9 million) and to a management reorganization within the Popular and Premium Wine operating segment ($2.6 million).
 
21.           ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
 
During 2000 and 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") addressed various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments, including EITF Issue No. 00-14 ("EITF No. 00-14"), "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," EITF Issue No. 00-22 ("EITF No. 00-22"), "Accounting for "Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future," and EITF Issue No. 00-25
("EITF No. 00-25"), "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products." In November 2001, the EITF codified EITF No. 00-14, EITF No. 00-22, and EITF No. 00-25 as part of EITF Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF No. 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)." EITF No. 01-09 addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including both a reseller of the vendor's products and an entity that purchases the vendor's products from a reseller). EITF No. 01-09, among other things, requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement. The Company currently reports such costs referred to in EITF No. 00-14 and EITF No. 00-25 as selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 01-09 in its financial statements beginning March 1, 2002. Upon adoption of EITF No. 01-09, financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes will be reclassified to comply with the requirements of EITF No. 01-09. For the fiscal years ended February 28, 2002. February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, net sales will be reduced by $222.4 million, $176.2 million, and $182.5 million, respectively, cost of product sold will increase by $10.1 million, $7.8 million, and $8.8 million, respectively, and selling, general and administrative expenses will decrease by $232.5 million, $184.0 million, and $191.3 million, respectively. This reclassification will not effect operating income or net income.
 
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations requiring all business combinations to be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. In addition, SFAS No. 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141 is effective immediately for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, as well as for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 141 for all business combinations for which the acquisition date was before July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 141 has not had a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company believes that the adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 141 will not have a material impact on its financial statements. On March 1, 2002, the Company reclassified $59.9 million of previously identified separable intangible assets into goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.
 
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company is required to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 for all goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. For goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001, these assets are subject immediately to the nonamortization and amortization provisions of SFAS No. 142. The Company's assessment of the financial impact of SFAS No. 142 on its financial statements is that $27.3 million of amortization expense of existing goodwill and other intangible assets for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2002. will not be incurred in subsequent fiscal years. The required transition impairment evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements.
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 144 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company believes the financial impact of SFAS No. 144 will not be material on its financial statements.
 
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, '"Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Lastly, SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company is required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 to have a material impact on its financial statements. However, it will result in a reclassification of the previously reported extraordinary item, net of income taxes, to increase nonoperating expense ($2.6 million) and to decrease the provision for income taxes ($1.0 million).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MANAGEMENT'S REPRESENTATIONS:
            
1)
 
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to quarterly reporting on Form 10-Q and reflect, in the opinion of the Company, all significant adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial information for the Company.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations.  These consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002.  Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results.
 
Certain February 28, 2002, balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
 
ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
            
2)
 
Effective March 1, 2002, the Company completed its adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS No. 141"), "Business Combinations," resulting in a reclassification of $46.8 million of previously identified separable intangible assets to goodwill and an elimination of $16.6 million of deferred tax liabilities previously associated with those intangible assets with a corresponding deduction from goodwill.  The adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have any other material impact on the Company's financial statements.
 
Effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets."  Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment.  Intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are subject to review for impairment.  Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company determined that certain of its intangible assets met the criteria to be considered indefinite lived and, accordingly, ceased their amortization effective March 1, 2002.  These intangible assets consisted principally of trademarks.  Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily distribution agreements, continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives which were not modified as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.  Nonamortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142 and amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 (as defined below).  Note 5 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.
 
The Company has completed its impairment testing for nonamortizable intangible assets and goodwill pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142.  No instances of impairment were noted as a result of these processes.
 
The following table presents earnings and earnings per share information for the comparative periods as if the nonamortization provisions of SFAS No. 142 had been applied as of March 1, 2001:
 
 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended November 30, 2002, are as follows:
 
 
Effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  SFAS No. 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion).  The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
 
Effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF No. 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)," which codified various issues related to the income statement classification of certain promotional payments under EITF Issue No. 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," EITF Issue No. 00-22, "Accounting for Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in the Future," and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."  EITF No. 01-09 addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of consideration given by a vendor to a customer (including both a reseller of the vendor's products and an entity that purchases the vendor's products from a reseller).  EITF No. 01-09, among other things, requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement.  The Company previously reported such costs as selling, general and administrative expenses.  As a result of adopting EITF No. 01-09 on March 1, 2002, the Company has restated net sales, cost of product sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2001.   Net sales were reduced by $157.5 million and $62.2 million, respectively; cost of product sold was increased by $8.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively; and selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $165.7 million and $65.3 million, respectively.  This reclassification did not affect operating income or net income.
 
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 ("SFAS No. 146"), "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
 
ACQUISITIONS:
            
3)
 
On March 5, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several well-known premium wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage, and Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California, and other related assets from Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River Vintners Group (the "Turner Road Vintners Assets").  The purchase price of the Turner Road Vintners Assets, including assumption of indebtedness of $9.4 million, was $289.2 million.  The acquisition was financed by the proceeds from the sale of the February 2001 Senior Notes and revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility.  The Turner Road Vintners Assets acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $146.7 million, is no longer being amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142.  The results of operations of the Turner Road Vintners Assets are reported in the Popular and Premium Wine segment and have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.
On March 26, 2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain wine brands, wineries, working capital (primarily inventories), and other related assets from Corus Brands, Inc. (the "Corus Assets").  In this acquisition, the Company acquired several well-known premium wine brands primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia, Ste. Chapelle and Alice White.  The purchase price of the Corus Assets, including assumption of indebtedness (net of cash acquired) of $3.0 million, was $52.3 million plus an earn-out over six years based on the performance of the brands.  As of November 30, 2002, the Company has paid an earn-out in the amount of $1.7 million.  In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered into long-term grape supply agreements with affiliates of Corus Brands, Inc. covering more than 1,000 acres of Washington and Idaho vineyards.  The acquisition was financed with revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility. The Corus Assets acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $48.9 million, is no longer beingamortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142.  The results of operations of the Corus Assets are reported in the Popular and Premium Wine segment and have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.
 
On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. (the "Ravenswood Acquisition").  The Ravenswood business produces, markets and sells super-premium and ultra-premium California wine, primarily under the Ravenswood brand name.  The purchase price of the Ravenswood Acquisition, including assumption of indebtedness of $2.8 million, was $152.5 million.  The purchase price was financed with revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility.  The Ravenswood Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value at the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $99.8 million, is not amortizable and is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142.  The Ravenswood Acquisition was consistent with the Company's strategy of further penetrating the higher gross profit margin super-premium and ultra-premium wine categories.  The results of operations of the Ravenswood business are reported in the Fine Wine segment and have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.
 
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Ravenswood Acquisition at July 2, 2001, as adjusted for the final appraisal:
 
 
The trademarks are not subject to amortization.  None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The following table sets forth the unaudited historical and unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company for the nine months ended November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001, respectively. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the nine months ended November 30, 2001, give effect to the acquisitions of the Turner Road Vintners Assets and the Corus Assets and the Ravenswood Acquisition as if they occurred on March 1, 2001.  The unaudited pro forma results of operations are presented after giving effect to certain adjustments for depreciation, amortization of goodwill, interest expense on the acquisition financing and related income tax effects.  The unaudited pro forma results of operations are based upon certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances.  The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the nine months ended November 30, 2001, do not reflect total nonrecurring charges of $12.6 million ($0.09 per share on a diluted basis) related to transaction costs, primarily for the acceleration of vesting of stock options, which were incurred by Ravenswood Winery, Inc. prior to the acquisition.  The unaudited pro forma results of operations do not purport to present what the Company's results of operations would actually have been if the aforementioned transactions had in fact occurred on such date or at the beginning of the period indicated, nor do they project the Company's financial position or results of operations at any future date or for any future period.
 
 
INVENTORIES:
            
4)
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.  Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and consist of the following:
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS:
            
5)
 
The major components of intangible assets are:
 
 
The difference between the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount for each item presented is attributable to accumulated amortization.  Amortization expense for intangible assets was $1.7 million and $0.6 million for the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2002, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:
 
 
INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE:
            
6)
 
On July 31, 2001, the Company and BRL Hardy Limited ("Hardy") completed the formation of Pacific Wine Partners LLC ("PWP"), a joint venture owned equally by the Company and Hardy.  The Company and PWP are parties to the following agreements: crushing, wine production, bottling, storage, and related services agreement; inventory supply agreement; sublease and assumption agreements pertaining to certain vineyards, which agreements include a market value adjustment provision; and a market value adjustment agreement relating to a certain vineyard lease held by PWP.  As of November 30, 2002, amounts related to the above agreements were not material.
 
On October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase of certain assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business in Sonoma County (the "Blackstone Assets").  The purchase price of the Blackstone Assets was $138.0 million and was financed equally by the Company and Hardy.  The Company used revolving loan borrowings under its senior credit facility to fund the Company's portion of the transaction.
 
As of November 30, 2002, the Company's investment balance, which is accounted for under the equity method, was $120.6 million and is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets.  The carrying amount of the investment is less than the Company's equity in the underlying net assets of PWP by $3.9 million.  This amount is included in earnings as the assets are used by PWP.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:
            
7)
 
In July 2002, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 120,000,000 shares to 275,000,000 shares and Class B Convertible Common Stock from 20,000,000 shares to 30,000,000 shares, thereby increasing the aggregate number of authorized shares of the Company to 306,000,000 shares.
 
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:
            
8)
 
Basic earnings per common share exclude the effect of common stock equivalents and are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period for Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per common share assume the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.
 
The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:
 
 
Stock options to purchase 1.1 million and 2.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $27.43 and $20.62 were outstanding during the nine months ended November 30, 2002 and 2001, but were not included in the computation of the diluted earnings per common share because the stock options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Stock for the period.  Stock options to purchase 1.1 million and 2.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $27.41 and $20.62 were outstanding during the three months ended November 30, 2002 and 2001, but were not included in the computation of the diluted earnings per common share because the stock options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Class A Common Stock for the period.
 
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME:
            
9)
 
Comprehensive income consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, net unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments and minimum pension liability adjustments.  The reconciliation of net income to comprehensive income is as follows:
 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the following components:
 
 
10)           RELATED PARTIES:
 
Agustin Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fine Wine segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various family owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions with the Fine Wine segment during the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001.  The Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the exclusive distributor of its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell grapes to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long-term contracts; participate as partners with the Fine Wine segment in the ownership and operation of a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and other consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally to the Fine Wine segment and the Company.  Total amounts to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements for the nine months ended November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001, totaled $4.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively.  Total amounts to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements for the three months ended November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001, totaled $3.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively.  In addition, the Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus Interests.  Total fees earned from the Huneeus Interests by the Fine Wine segment for these services were not material for the nine months and three months ended November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001.  As of November 30, 2002, and November 30, 2001, the net amounts due to/from the Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant.

The Subsidiary Guarantors are wholly owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. Separate financial statements for the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Company are not presented because the Company has determined that such financial statements would not be material to investors.  The Subsidiary Guarantors comprise all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, other than Matthew Clark, the Company's Canadian subsidiary and certain other subsidiaries which individually, and in the aggregate, are inconsequential.  The accounting policies of the parent company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Subsidiary Nonguarantors are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002, and include the accounting changes described in Note 2 herein.

12)           BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:
The Company reports its operating results in five segments: Popular and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine, cider and bottled water, and wholesale wine, cider, distilled spirits, beer and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super-premium and ultra-premium wine) and Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items).  Segment selection was based upon internal organizational structure, the way in which these operations are managed and their performance evaluated by management, and the availability of separate financial results.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002, and include the accounting changes described in Note 2 herein.  The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective business units.
Segment information is as follows:
 
 
13)           ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."  SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003.  The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements."  In addition, SFAS No. 145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions.  Lastly, SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions.  The Company is required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003.  All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 were adopted on March 1, 2002.  The adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.  The adoption of the remaining provisions will result in a reclassification of the extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002 ($1.6 million, net of income taxes), by increasing selling, general and administrative expenses ($2.6 million) and decreasing the provision for income taxes ($1.0 million).
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN No. 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Othersan Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34."  FIN No. 45 addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees.  FIN No. 45 also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee.  Lastly, FIN No. 45 supersedes FASB Interpretation No. 34, "Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5)."  The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The Company is required to adopt the disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003.
 
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF No. 00-21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables."  EITF No. 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities.  EITF No. 00-21 also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement.  The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 00-21 for all revenue arrangements entered into beginning August 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of EITF No. 00-21 on its financial statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure."  SFAS No. 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS No. 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123  to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation.  Lastly, SFAS No. 148 amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28 ("APB Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial Reporting," to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information.  The Company is required to adopt the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003.  The Company is required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning March 1, 2003.
