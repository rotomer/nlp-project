-2- Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets On January 17, 2003, Constellation Brands, Inc. ("Constellation") and BRL Hardy Limited, an Australian corporation ("BRL Hardy"), entered into an agreement to effect an acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of BRL Hardy by Constellation Australia Pty Limited, an Australian corporation that is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Constellation ("Constellation Australia"). On March 27, 2003, Constellation acquired control of BRL Hardy's Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the agreement. On April 9, 2003, the acquisition was implemented by all of the outstanding shares of BRL Hardy being transferred to Constellation Australia and the BRL Hardy options held by employees of BRL Hardy and its affiliates being cancelled. In consideration for the transfer of the BRL Hardy shares, Constellation Australia is obligated to pay the holders of such shares aggregate cash consideration of A$1.74 billion (equivalent to approximately US$1.04 billion) and Constellation issued to certain electing holders of BRL Hardy shares (or to a depositary issuing depositary interests to such holders) 3,288,913 shares of class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Constellation (attributed a value of US$76.4 million for purposes of the transaction). In addition, Constellation Australia loaned A$32.1 million (equivalent to approximately US$19.3 million) to BRL Hardy to enable BRL Hardy to effect the cancellation of all of the outstanding stock options of BRL Hardy. Constellation Australia also loaned approximately A$570 million (equivalent to approximately US$341 million) to BRL Hardy to permit BRL Hardy to satisfy its outstanding bank debt. The consideration for the BRL Hardy shares and options was determined on an arms-length basis following negotiations between the Board of Directors of each of BRL Hardy and Constellation and their respective advisors. The cash used to pay the cash portion of the consideration and to make loans to BRL Hardy is being funded with proceeds from loans under (i) an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2003 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Constellation and certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, and JPMorgan Europe Limited, as London Agent, and (ii) an Amended and Restated Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of January 16 2003 and amended and restated on March 26, 2003 (the "Bridge Loan Agreement"), among Constellation and certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders named therein, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement provides for revolving credit loans and term loans in an original aggregate principal amount of up to US$1.6 billion (which amount, under certain circumstances, may be increased to up to US$1.9 billion), and the Bridge Loan Agreement provides for bridge loans in an original aggregate principal amount of up to $450 million. Constellation utilized US$1.0 billion of term loans under the Credit Agreement and approximately US$400 million under the Bridge Loan Agreement to consummate the transactions. BRL Hardy is a leading Australian producer and exporter of wine, with products sourced from Australia, New Zealand and France. BRL Hardy's wines are distributed worldwide through a network of sales and marketing operations, with the majority of sales generated in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Major export brands include: Hardys Stamp of Australia, Hardys Nottage Hill, Hardys VR and Banrock Station. Other domestic and international brands include: Houghton, Nobilo, Leasingham, Moondah Brook, Yarra Burn,
-3- Stonehaven, Stanley and Renmano. Constellation intends to continue to operate the business of BRL Hardy. Prior to the transactions described above, there was no material relationship between the officers, directors or shareholders of BRL Hardy and Constellation or any of its affiliates, any director or officer of Constellation or any associate of any such director or officer, except that BRL Hardy and Constellation were equal owners of Pacific Wine Partners, LLC, a joint venture established to produce, market and sell a global portfolio of premium wines in the US, including a range of Australian imports provided by BRL Hardy.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Scheme Consideration 5.1 Forms of Scheme Consideration (a) Subject to clause 5.1(b), the Scheme Consideration in respect of each Scheme Share is either: (i) a cash amount of A$10.50 (the "Cash Consideration"); or (ii) the number of New Constellation Shares calculated in accordance with clause 5.2 (the "Scrip Consideration"). Each Scheme Shareholder is entitled to receive either Cash Consideration or Scrip Consideration in respect of each Scheme Share held by that Scheme Shareholder. The allocation of each Scheme Shareholder's entitlement to Scheme Consideration as between Cash Consideration and Scrip Consideration will be determined in accordance with clause 5.3. (b) If the US Listing Conditions are not satisfied by the date which is 5 Business Days before the Scheme Meeting or the Australian Listing Condition is not satisfied by 8.00 am on the Second Court Date then, in accordance with the terms of the Share Scheme, all Scheme Shareholders will receive Cash Consideration whether or not they have elected to receive Scrip Consideration. 5.2 Calculation of Scrip Consideration Subject to clause 5.5 the Scrip Consideration is the number of New Constellation Shares for each Scheme Share given by the following formula: C x 10.50 N = ---------- where: P N is the number of New Constellation Shares to be issued as consideration for each Scheme Share; P is the Constellation Share Price in US$ provided that: (a) if the Constellation Share Price is below US$22.50, P is 22.50; and (b) if the Constellation Share Price is above US$27.50, P is 27.50; C is the average of the closing US$/A$ exchange rate (in units of US$ per A$1.00) as quoted by Bloomberg (based on the New York market close at 5.30 pm (New York time)) for each day in the Price Setting Period. 5.3 Form of Scheme Consideration Subject to clause 5.1(b) the, form of Scheme Consideration to be paid to Scheme Shareholders will be determined in accordance with the following provisions of this clause 5.3: (a) each Scheme Shareholder who does not make an Election will receive Cash Consideration in respect of all of that Scheme Shareholder's Scheme Shares; (b) each Scheme Shareholder who makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Cash Consideration will receive that part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Cash Consideration;
(c) subject to clause 5.6, each Scheme Shareholder who makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration will receive: (i) such part of the Scheme Consideration to which that Scheme Shareholder is entitled as is ascertained in accordance with clause 5.4 in the form of Scrip Consideration; and (ii) the balance of the Scheme Consideration to which that Scheme Shareholder is entitled in the form of Cash Consideration. 5.4 Allocation of Scrip Consideration (a) If the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation pursuant to Elections to receive Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration (a "Scrip Election") if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full is less than or equal to the Scrip Consideration Cap then each Scheme Shareholder who has made a Scrip Election in respect of some or all of that Scheme Shareholder's Scheme Shares will receive Scrip Consideration in respect of all of the Scheme Shares in respect of which the Scrip Election is made. (b) If the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation pursuant to Scrip Elections if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full exceeds the Scrip Consideration Cap then each Scheme Shareholder who has made a Scrip Election will receive Scrip Consideration in respect of such number of the Scheme Shares in respect of which the Scrip Election is made as is given by the following formula C x E S = ------ A where: S is the number of Scheme Shares in respect of which Scrip Consideration will be received by the Scheme Shareholder. C is the number of New Constellation Shares comprising the Scrip Consideration Cap. E is the number of Scheme Shares in respect of which a Scrip Election was made by the Scheme Shareholder. A is the aggregate number of New Constellation Shares which would be issued by Constellation to Scheme Shareholders if all Scrip Elections were satisfied in full. 5.5 Constellation CDIs Where an Eligible Scheme Shareholder is entitled to Scrip Consideration in accordance with clause 5.3: (a) the number of New Constellation Shares which would otherwise be required to be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder will not be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder and will instead be issued to the Depositary to hold on trust for the Eligible Scheme Shareholder; and (b) Constellation Australia will cause to be issued to the Eligible Scheme Shareholder
10 Constellation CDIs for each New Constellation Share to which the Eligible Scheme Shareholder would be entitled under clause 5.2. 5.6 Foreign Scheme Shareholders If a Foreign Scheme Shareholder makes an Election to receive all or part of the Scheme Consideration in the form of Scrip Consideration then: (a) the New Constellation Shares which would otherwise be required to be issued to the Foreign Scheme Shareholder will not be issued to the Foreign Scheme Shareholder and will instead be issued to a nominee appointed by Constellation; (b) Constellation will cause the nominee to offer for sale on the open market within 5 Business Days after the Implementation Date all of the New Constellation Shares issued to the nominee under this clause 5.6 in such manner, at such price and on such other terms as the nominee shall determine and to remit to Constellation the proceeds of sale (after deducting brokerage, taxes and other costs of sale) (the "Proceeds") ; and (c) Constellation will pay to each Foreign Shareholder such fraction of the Proceeds as is equal to the number of New Constellation Shares which would have been issued to the Foreign Shareholder but for the application of this clause 5.6 divided by the total number of New Constellation Shares issued to the nominee under this clause 5.6. 5.7 Fractional entitlements If a fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share arises from the calculation of the Scheme Consideration in respect of a Scheme Shareholder, then any such fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of New Constellation Shares, as the case may be, and all fractional entitlements will be paid in the form of Cash Consideration. Any Cash Consideration payable under this clause 5.7 will be calculated by multiplying the fractional entitlement to a New Constellation Share by the Constellation Share Price converted into Australian dollars using the exchange rate referred to in clause 5.2. 5.8 Currency of Cash Consideration All Cash Consideration payable to Scheme Shareholders other than any payments made pursuant to clause 5.6 must be paid by cheque drawn in Australian dollars. 5.9 Joint holders In the case of Scheme Shares held in joint names: (a) any cheque required to be paid to Scheme Shareholders shall be payable to the joint holders and be forwarded to the holder whose name appears first in the Register on the Record Date; and (b) any stock certificates and uncertificated holding statements for Constellation Shares or Constellation CDIs to be issued to Scheme Shareholders shall be issued in the names of the joint holders and forwarded to the holder whose name appears first in the Register as at the Record Date.

The Incremental Term Loans to be made pursuant to any Incremental Term Loan Agreement in response to any such request by the Borrower shall be deemed to be a separate "Series" of Incremental Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the minimum aggregate principal amount of Incremental Term Loan Commitments entered into pursuant to any request specified above (and, accordingly, the minimum aggregate principal amount of any Series of Incremental Term Loans) shall be $75,000,000, (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Incremental Term Loans of all Series, together with the aggregate unutilized Incremental Term Commitments of all Series, shall not exceed $300,000,000 at any time, (iii) the Incremental Term Loan Commitments of any Series shall terminate on the earlier of the Incremental Term Loan Availability Date and the date 30 days after the date of the respective Incremental Term Loan Agreement for such Series and (iv) in no event shall the Incremental Term Loan Agreement for any Series of Incremental Term Loans provide for the final maturity of the Incremental Term Loans of such Series to be earlier than the Tranche B Term Loan Maturity Date, or for the weighted average life to maturity of the Incremental Term Loans of such Series to be less than the weighted average life to maturity of the Tranche B Term Loans as of the date of such Incremental Term Loan Agreement (such determination of average life to be made by the Administrative Agent). Following agreement by the Borrower and one or more of the Lenders as provided above, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Incremental Term Loan Lender of any Series agrees to make Incremental Term Loans of such Series to the Borrower from time to time during the period from and including the date of the respective Incremental Term Loan Agreement for such Series to and including the earlier of the Incremental Term Loan Availability Date and the date 30 days after the date of such Incremental Term Loan Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount up to but not exceeding the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Series of such Incremental Term Loan Lender. SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Obligations of Lenders. Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required.
-40- (b) Type of Loans. Subject to Section 2.13, each Borrowing shall be constituted entirely of ABR Loan or Eurocurrency Loans may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. At the commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing , such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of U.S.$3,000,000 or a larger multiple of U.S.$100,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount equal to U.S.$3,000,000 or a larger multiple of U.S.$100,000; provided that an ABR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments of the applicable Class or that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(g). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount equal to U.S.$500,000 or a larger multiple of U.S.$100,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of thirty (30) Eurocurrency Borrowings outstanding. (d) Limitations on Lengths of Interest Periods. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert to or continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing: (i) any Revolving Borrowing of any Class if the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the Revolving Commitment Termination Date of such Class; (ii) any Term Loan Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the Term Loan Maturity Date for the relevant Class; or (iii) unless the Borrower shall confirm to the Applicable Agent in connection with such request or election that the Borrower intends to compensate each Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 (to the extent required to do so thereunder), any Term Loan Borrowing if the Interest Period requested therefor would commence before and end after any Principal Payment Date unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, as the case may be, having Interest Periods that end after such Principal Payment Date shall be equal to or less than the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, respectively, permitted to be outstanding after giving effect to the payments of principal required to be made on such Principal Payment Date. SECTION 2.03. Requests for Borrowings. To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, (b) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in Australian Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., London time, four Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (c) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of a Revolving ABR Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(g) may be given not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such
-41- telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by such Applicable Agent and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a U.S. Dollar Revolving Borrowing, Australian Dollar Revolving Borrowing, Tranche A Term Loan Borrowing, Tranche B Term Loan Borrowing or Incremental Term Loan Borrowing (including, if applicable, the respective Series of Incremental Term Loans to which such Borrowing relates);; (ii) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing; (iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; (iv) in the case of a Borrowing denominated is in U.S. Dollars, whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; (v) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and (vi) the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) Agreement to Make Swingline Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the U.S. Dollar Revolving Availability Period, in U.S. Dollars in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding U.S.$30,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total U.S. Dollar Revolving Exposures and the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the total Australian Dollar Revolving Exposures exceeding the total U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. (b) Interest Rates. Swingline Loans shall be ABR Loans or FFBR Loans (with an Interest Period of two weeks), as selected by the Borrower, except that the Swingline Lender and the Borrower may agree that the interest rate in respect of a Swingline Loan made by the Swingline Lender, for a period ending on the date that is not earlier than one day and not later
-42- than fifteen days after such Swingline Loan is made, be at an alternative rate of interest (and with such applicable margins and prepayment premiums) as may from time to time be offered by the Swingline Lender to the Borrower in its sole discretion; provided that upon any sale pursuant to Section 2.04(d) of participations in any Swingline Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Base Rate or any such alternative rate, such Swingline Loans shall automatically be converted into an ABR Loan. (c) Notice of Swingline Loans by the Borrower. To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day), amount and Type of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to a deposit account designated by the Borrower (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(g), by remittance to the respective Issuing Lender) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan. (d) Participations by Lenders in Swingline Loans. The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice to the Administrative Agent shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans on the applicable Business Day as provided above. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above in this paragraph, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Swingline Lender, such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline
-43- Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. (e) Replacement of Swingline Lender. The Borrower may at any time, and from time to time, request that the then-current Swingline Lender be replaced with another Lender hereunder designated by the Borrower and reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Any such replacement shall be effected pursuant to a written instrument, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, under which such new Lender agrees to become the "Swingline Lender" hereunder, and the predecessor Swingline Lender is relieved of all of its obligations hereunder as the "Swingline Lender"; provided that in no event shall any such replacement occur unless the principal of and interest on all of the Swingline Loans of the predecessor Swingline Lender shall have been paid in full. SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request an Issuing Lender to issue, at any time and from time to time during the U.S. Dollar Revolving Availability Period, Committed Letters of Credit for its own account in such form as is acceptable to such Issuing Lender in its reasonable determination. Committed Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall be issued in U.S. Dollars and shall constitute utilization of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments specified by the Borrower at the time it requests such Committed Letter of Credit to be issued hereunder. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal or Extension. To request the issuance of a Committed Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Committed Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the respective Issuing Lender) to the respective Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Committed Letter of Credit, or identifying the Committed Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Committed Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (e) of this Section) and the amount of such Committed Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Committed Letter of Credit. If requested by the respective Issuing Lender, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on such Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request for a Committed Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an Issuing Lender relating to any Committed Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
-44- (c) Alternative Currency Letters of Credit. (i) Requests for Offers. From time to time during the U.S. Dollar Revolving Availability Period the Borrower may request the Issuing Lenders to make offers to issue a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency for account of the Borrower. Each Issuing Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to such Issuing Lender, and the Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers. The issuance of each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be subject to the conditions of Section 5.04 and to such other conditions as are agreed upon by the Borrower and the Issuing Lender issuing such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.05, each such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be issued, and subsequently, renewed, extended, amended and confirmed, on such terms as the Borrower and such Issuing Lender shall agree, including, without limitation, expiry, drawing conditions, reimbursement, interest, fees and provision of cover. Each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall constitute utilization of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments specified by the Borrower at the time it requests such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit to be issued hereunder (ii) Reports to Administrative Agent. Each Issuing Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each other Issuing Lender a report in respect of each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (each such report, an "Alternative Currency Letter of Credit Report") on and as of the date on which (x) such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit is issued, (y) the issuance, renewal, extension or amendment of a Committed Letter of Credit, if any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit is then outstanding, and (z) the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments are to be reduced pursuant to Section 2.08, specifying for each such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (after giving effect to issuance thereof, as applicable): (A) the date on which such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit was or is being issued; (B) the Alternative Currency of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit; (C) the aggregate undrawn amount of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (in such Alternative Currency); (D) the aggregate unpaid amount of LC Disbursements under such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (in such Alternative Currency); (E) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency LC Exposure in respect of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit; and (F) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate amount of Alternative Currency LC Exposures in respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender. Each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit Report shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders by 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date on which it is required
-45- to be delivered. The Borrower agrees to promptly provide the Issuing Lenders with such reasonably requested information as may be needed to prepare an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit Report. (d) Limitations on Amounts. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure of all Issuing Lenders (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section) shall not exceed U.S.$40,000,000, (ii) the sum of the total U.S. Dollar Revolving Exposures and the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the total Australian Dollar Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments and (iii) the aggregate LC Exposure of such Issuing Lender (determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section) shall not exceed the maximum LC Exposure for such Issuing Lender, if any, specified in the instrument contemplated by clause (k) below. (e) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit, so long as such renewal or extension occurs within three months of such then-current expiration date) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment Termination Date. (f) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) by any Issuing Lender in respect of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments, and without any further action on the part of such Issuing Lender or the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender, and each such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the respective Issuing Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of (x) each LC Disbursement made by an Issuing Lender in respect of each Committed Letter of Credit and (y) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent, using the Exchange Rates on the date such payment is required, of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender in an Alternative Currency, promptly upon the request of such Issuing Lender at any time from the time of such LC Disbursement until such
-46- LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the respective Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to the next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the respective Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. (g) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement (i) under a Committed Letter of Credit by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount in U.S. Dollars equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (x) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (y) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time (provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than U.S.$100,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with a U.S. Dollar Revolving ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting U.S. Dollar Revolving ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan) and (ii) under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit by paying to the London Agent an amount in the relevant Alternative Currency equal to such LC Disbursement not later that 12:00 noon, London time, on (x) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., London time, or (y) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof together with, in the case of an LC Disbursement under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof, using the Exchange Rates which would apply were such Lender to pay such amount on the date such notice is delivered to such Lender. (h) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (g) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document
-47- presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the respective Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, and (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the respective Issuing Lender or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Lender; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that: (i) an Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; (ii) an Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). (i) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
-48- (j) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply; provided further that, in case of any LC Disbursement made under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect thereto shall be payable in U.S. Dollars and shall accrue on the U.S. Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated using the Exchange Rates on the date such LC Disbursement was made. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (k) Addition / Termination of Issuing Lenders. Any Lender may be added as an Issuing Lender (each such Lender, an "Additional Issuing Lender") at any time pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Additional Issuing Lender and to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Additional Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of each Additional Issuing Lender. From and after the effective date of any such addition, (i) the Additional Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to include such Additional Issuing Lender. In addition, any Issuing Lender, with the consent of the Borrower, may cease being an Issuing Lender (each such Issuing Lender, a "Terminating Issuing Lender") at any time pursuant to a written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Terminating Issuing Lender and to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Terminating Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of each Terminating Issuing Lender. At the time such termination is effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of the respective Terminating Issuing Lender. After the termination of a Terminating Issuing Lender, such Terminating Issuing Lender shall remain a party hereto as an Issuing Lender and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to the Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such termination, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (l) Cash Collateralization. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing at least 66-2/3% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to, in the case of an Event of Default, the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that (i) the portions of such amount attributable to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements denominated in Alternative
-49- Currencies shall be deposited in the applicable Alternative Currencies in the actual amounts of such undrawn Alternative Currency Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii) the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VIII. For purposes of this paragraph, Alternative Currency LC Exposure shall be calculated using the Exchange Rates on the date notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the Borrower. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent in the Collateral Account as collateral in the first instance for the LC Exposure under this Agreement and thereafter for the payment of the "Secured Obligations" under and as defined in the U.S. Pledge Agreement, and for these purposes the Borrower hereby grants a security interest to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in the Collateral Account and in any financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other Property held therein. (m) Existing Letters of Credit. Pursuant to Section 2.05 of the 1999 Credit Agreement, JPMorgan Chase, as an "Issuing Lender" thereunder, has issued various "Letters of Credit" under and as defined in the 1999 Credit Agreement. On the Effective Date, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to effectiveness of the obligations of the Lenders hereunder set forth in Article V, each of such "Letters of Credit" under the 1999 Credit Agreement shall automatically, and without any action on the part of any Person, become a Letter of Credit hereunder and constitute a utilization of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments. (n) Conversion. In the event that the Loans become immediately due and payable on any date pursuant to Article VIII, all amounts (i) that the Borrower is at the time or thereafter becomes required to reimburse or otherwise pay to the Administrative Agent in respect of LC Disbursements made under any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (other than amounts in respect of which the Borrower has deposited cash collateral pursuant to paragraph (l) of this Section, if such cash collateral was deposited in the applicable Alternative Currency to the extent so deposited or applied), (ii) that the U.S. Revolving Lenders are at the time or thereafter become required to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent is at the time or thereafter becomes required to distribute to the Issuing Lenders pursuant to paragraph (g) of the Section in respect of unreimbursed LC Disbursements made under any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit and (iii) of each U.S. Revolving Lender's participation in any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit under which an LC Disbursement has been made shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the U.S. Dollar Equivalent, calculated using the Exchange Rates on such date (or in the case of any LC Disbursement made after such date, on the date such LC Disbursement is made), of such amounts. On and after such conversion, all amounts accruing and owed to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or any U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender in respect of the obligations described in this paragraph shall accrue and be payable in U.S. Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder. SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Funding by Lenders. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time (or, in the case of any Australian Dollar Revolving Loan, 12:00 noon,
-50- London time), to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that U.S. Dollar Revolving ABR Borrowings made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(g) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the respective Issuing Lender. (b) Presumption by the Administrative Agent. Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Elections for Borrowings. Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have the Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert any Borrowing made to it to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, the Borrower, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period for Borrowings made to it, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Australian Dollar Revolving Loan may be converted to another Type, and the Borrower may not convert its Loans of other Types to Australian Dollar Revolving Loans. (b) Notice of Elections. To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Applicable Agent and signed by the Borrower.
-51- (c) Information in Interest Election Requests. Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies (including, if applicable, the respective Series of Incremental Term Loans to which such Interest Election Request relates) and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) if the resulting Borrowing is denominated in U.S. Dollars, whether such resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. (d) Notice by the Applicable Agent to Lenders. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each relevant Lender of the details thereof and of each such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) Failure to Elect; Events of Default. If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing, and if the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to an Australian Dollar Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested an Australian Dollar Revolving Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
-52- SECTION 2.08. Termination and Reduction of the Commitments. (a) Scheduled Termination.

(b) Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Class pursuant to this Section shall be in an amount that is U.S.$3,000,000 or a larger multiple of U.S.$100,000, or the remaining amount of the Commitments of such Class and (ii) except as provided in Section 2.08(d) (but subject to Section 2.10(c)), the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans of such Class of in accordance with Section 2.10, the total Revolving Exposures of such Class would exceed the total Revolving Commitments of such Class. (c) Notice of Voluntary Termination or Reduction. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments of any Class under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments of any Class delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. (d) Effect of Termination or Reduction. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class. SECTION 2.09.

Prepayments by the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be applied as follows: first, such prepayment shall be applied to any then outstanding Term Loans, ratably in accordance with the then-outstanding aggregate principal amounts thereof; and second, after the payment in full of any then outstanding Term Loans, such prepayment shall be applied to any then outstanding Revolving Loans (without reduction of Revolving Commitments), ratably in accordance with the then-outstanding aggregate principal amounts thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this clause (viii) to the contrary, if at any time Tranche A Terms Loans are outstanding, any Tranche B Term Loan Lender shall have the option to forego any such prepayment of a Tranche B Term Loan held by it in its sole discretion, and in any such case, the amount that would otherwise be applied to prepay such Tranche B Term Loan will be applied pro rata to the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans of the Tranche B Term Loan Lenders who have not foregone the related prepayment, and any amount remaining after prepayment in full of the Tranche B Term Loans of any Tranche B Term Loan Lenders who have not foregone such prepayment will be applied pro rata to the outstanding Tranche A Term Loans. Each such prepayment of the Term Loans of any Class pursuant to this clause (b)(viii) shall be applied to the remaining installments thereof on a pro rata basis. (c) Mandatory Prepayments - U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans. The Borrower will prepay the U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans hereunder if requested by the Required U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders (through the Administrative Agent) if the Administrative Agent or such Lenders determine on any date that the total U.S. Dollar Revolving Exposure, after giving effect to any Borrowing on any date of U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans or issuance, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit hereunder, plus the total Australian Dollar Revolving Exposure, after giving effect to any Borrowing on any date of Australian Dollar Revolving Loans hereunder, exceeds the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments on such date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess. (d) Notices, Etc. The Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment (or in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in
-62- Australian Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., London time, four Business Days before the date of prepayment), (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08(c). Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Applicable Agent shall advise the relevant Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.09(c). SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the unused U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments of such U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the earlier of the date such U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment terminates and the applicable U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment Termination Date. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of each Australian Dollar Revolving Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the unused Australian Dollar Revolving Commitments of such Australian Dollar Revolving Lender during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the earlier of the date such Australian Dollar Revolving Commitment terminates and the applicable Australian Dollar Revolving Commitment Termination Date. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable on each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Revolving Commitments of the applicable Class terminate and the applicable Revolving Commitment Termination Date of such Class, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate applicable to interest on Eurocurrency U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment
-63- terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Lender, a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate set forth in the instrument of such Issuing Lender contemplated by Section 2.05(k) on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure of such Issuing Lender (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements and determined for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 2.05) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Lender's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For the purposes of calculating the average daily balance of the LC Exposure for any period under this Section 2.11(b), the average daily amount of the Alternative Currency LC Exposure for such period shall be calculated by multiplying (x) the average daily balance of each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (expressed in the Alternate Currency of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit) by (y) the Exchange Rate for each such Alternative Currency in effect on the last Business Day of such period or by such other reasonable method that the Administrative Agent deems appropriate. (c) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. (d) Payment of Fees. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in U.S. Dollars and in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the respective Issuing Lender, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. SECTION 2.12. Interest. (a) ABR Loans. The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing (other than in respect of Swingline Loans, as to which paragraph (c) below shall apply) shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. (b) Eurocurrency Loans. The Loans constituting each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
-64- (c) Swingline ABR and FFBR Borrowings. Each ABR Borrowing constituting a Swingline Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Each Swingline Borrowing the interest on which is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Base Rate for any Interest Period therefor shall bear interest at a rate per annum, for each day during such Interest Period, equal to the Federal Funds Base Rate for such period plus the Applicable Rate plus 0.50%. Each Swingline Borrowing the interest on which is determined at an alternate rate of interest as contemplated in Section 2.04(b), shall bear interest at the respective alternate rate of interest so agreed for the period so contemplated by Section 2.04(b). (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (e) Payment of Interest. Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans of any Class, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments of such Class; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Revolving ABR Loan prior to the U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment Termination Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (f) Computation. All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of the Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing (the Loan Currency of such Borrowing herein called the "Affected Currency"): (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Affected Currency, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or
-65- (b) if such Borrowing is of a particular Class of Loans, the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders of such Class that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for such Affected Currency, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the Affected Currency shall be ineffective, and, if the Affected Currency is U.S. Dollars, such Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, an ABR Borrowing, (ii) if the Affected Currency is U.S. Dollars and any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (iii) if the Affected Currency is Australian Dollars, any Borrowing Request that requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in the Australian Dollars shall be ineffective. SECTION 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or any Issuing Lender; or (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or such Issuing Lender of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such Issuing Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any Issuing Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Issuing
-66- Lender or such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate, in the case of any amount payable as specified in paragraph (a) of this Section, shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount). The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. SECTION 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan, Australian Dollar Revolving Loan or Swingline FFBR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.10(d) and is revoked in accordance herewith), (c) the Borrowing of any Term Loan the Interest Period for which commences before and ends after any Principal Payment Date (unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, as the case may be, having Interest Periods that end after such Principal Payment Date shall be equal to or less than the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans, respectively, permitted to be outstanding after giving effect to the payments of principal required to be made on such Principal Payment Date), or (e) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to
-67- such event (including such loss, cost and expense as calculated below but otherwise excluding any lost profit): (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, Borrowing, failure or assignment to the last day of then current Interest Period for such Loan (or (x) in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation and (y) in the case of a Borrowing of any Term Loan, the period from the date of such Borrowing to the applicable Principal Payment Date) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Term Loans, such other period), over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in U.S. Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period; and (b) in the case of a Swingline FFBR Loan, the loss to the Swingline Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by the Swingline Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the Federal Funds Base Rate for the period commencing on the date of such payment to but not including the last day of the Interest Period for such Swingline FFBR Loan, over (ii) the Federal Funds Base Rate for such Interest Period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate to include in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount or amounts). The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.16. Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Covered Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
-68- (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Indemnification by the Borrowers. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or an Issuing Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate to include in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount). (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Foreign Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) Refund. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section 2.16, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Subsidiary Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other Person.
-69- SECTION 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Payments by the Obligors. Each Obligor shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) or under any other Loan Document (except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time (or, in the case of any payment of any Australian Dollar Revolving Loan, London time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim; provided that if a new Loan is to be made by any Lender on a date the Borrower is to repay any principal of an outstanding Loan of such Lender, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of such new Loan to the payment of the principal to be repaid and only an amount equal to the difference between the principal to be borrowed and the principal to be repaid shall be made available by such Lender to the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.06 or paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this paragraph, as the case may be. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at an office specified by it, except as otherwise expressly provided in the relevant Loan Document, and except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made in U.S. Dollars (except for payments in respect of Loans denominated in Australian Dollars, which are payable in Australian Dollars). (b) Application of Insufficient Payments. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing of a particular Class shall be made from the relevant Lenders, each payment of commitment fee under Section 2.11 shall be made for account of the relevant Revolving Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments of a particular Class under Section 2.08 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of such Class of the relevant Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class; (ii) each Borrowing of any Class shall be allocated pro rata among the relevant Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments of such Class (in the case of the
-70- making of Loans) or their respective Loans of such Class (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans, Australian Dollar Revolving Loans, Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans, Australian Dollar Revolving Loans, Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders. (d) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Obligor rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Obligor in the amount of such participation. (e) Presumptions of Payment. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders or an Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
-71- (f) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent. If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(d), 2.05(f) or (g), 2.06(b) or 2.17(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a U.S. Dollar Revolving Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the relevant Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
-72- ARTICLE III GUARANTEE SECTION 3.01. The Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantee to each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and all other amounts from time to time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by the Borrower under this Agreement and by any Obligor under any of the other Loan Documents, and all obligations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to any Lender (or any Affiliate of any Lender) in respect of any Hedging Agreement, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations").

The obligations of the Subsidary Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section that the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several, under any and all circumstances. In full recognition and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that: (a) Without affecting the enforceability or effectiveness of Section 3.01 in accordance with its terms and without affecting, limiting, reducing, discharging or terminating the liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at any time and from time to time and without notice or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever: (i) amend, supplement, modify, extend, renew, waive, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or performance of, or the terms of, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate or rates of interest on all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations);

(b) The enforceability and effectiveness of this Article and the liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors, and the rights remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, shall not be affected, limited, reduced, discharged or terminated, and each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives any defense now or in the future arising, by reason of: (i) the illegality, invalidity, irregularity, authenticity, or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any agreement, security document, guarantee or other instrument relative to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (including

-76- Subsidiary Guarantor or may preclude any Subsidiary Guarantor from obtaining reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or other recovery from any other Subsidiary Guarantor, the Borrower any other guarantor or any other Person and even though the Borrower may not, as a result of such foreclosure, sale or election of remedies, be liable for any deficiency; (ix) any benefits the Borrower, any Subsidiary Guarantor or any other guarantor may otherwise derive from Sections 580(a), 580(b), 580(d) or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction; (x) any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other person that directly or indirectly results in or aids the discharge or release of the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor, of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security or guarantee (including any letter of credit) for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law or otherwise; (xi) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety's principal obligation; (xii) the possibility that the obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may at any time and from time to time exceed the aggregate liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Article; (xiii) any counterclaim, set-off or other claim which the Borrower or any other Subsidiary Guarantor has or alleges to have with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (xiv) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any Person; (xv) the election by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in a bankruptcy proceeding of any Person, of the application or nonapplication of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xvi) any extension of credit or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xvii) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xviii) any agreement or stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding of any Person; (xix) the avoidance of any lien in favor of the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any reason;

(c) Each Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent that it has established adequate means of obtaining financial and other information pertaining to the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of the Borrower and its properties on a continuing basis and that such Subsidiary Guarantor is now and will in the future remain fully familiar with the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of the Borrower and its properties. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further represents and warrants that it has reviewed and approved this Agreement and the related Loan Documents and is fully familiar with the transactions contemplated by such Loan Documents and that it will in the future remain fully familiar with such transaction and with any new Loan Documents and the transaction contemplated by such Loan Documents. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders (should any such duty exist) to disclose to such or any other Subsidiary Guarantor any matter of fact or other information related to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or its properties or to any Loan Documents or the transactions undertaken pursuant to, or contemplated by, such Loan Documents, whether now or in the future known by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. SECTION 3.03. Reinstatement. The obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. SECTION 3.04. Subrogation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby waives all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of law (including
-78- any such right arising under the Bankruptcy Code) or otherwise by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the provisions of this Article until such time as the obligations under this Agreement have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full and the Commitments have terminated. Each Subsidiary Guarantor understands that, by reason of the foregoing provisions of this Section, the exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges that it has under this Article and under the other Loan Documents will result in nonreimbursable liabilities under this Agreement. Nevertheless, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to exercise, in its or their sole discretion, any combination of such rights, remedies, powers and privileges as they, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. SECTION 3.05. Remedies. Each Subsidiary Guarantor jointly and severally agrees that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01. SECTION 3.06. Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or the Administrative Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Subsidiary Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213. SECTION 3.07. Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. SECTION 3.08. Rights of Contribution. The Subsidiary Guarantors hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any Subsidiary Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Subsidiary Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Subsidiary Guarantor shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Subsidiary Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Subsidiary Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the other provisions of this Article and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations.
-79- For purposes of this Section, (i) "Excess Funding Guarantor" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Subsidiary Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) "Excess Payment" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "Pro Rata Share" means, for any Subsidiary Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all properties of such Subsidiary Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any other Subsidiary Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any other Subsidiary Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such Subsidiary Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of all of the Subsidiary Guarantors exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) of all of the Subsidiary Guarantors, determined (A) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a party hereto on the Effective Date, as of the Effective Date, and (B) with respect to any other Subsidiary Guarantor, as of the date such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. SECTION 3.09. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally (including "financial assistance" rules under the laws of England, including Sections 151 to and including 158 of the Companies Act), if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under Section 3.01 would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.08, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Subsidiary Guarantor, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding (or, in the case of Canandaigua Limited, be limited so as not to guarantee the portion of the Loans that are not permitted to be guaranteed under such "financial assistance" rules). ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that (subject to Section 10.15): SECTION 4.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding Inactive Subsidiaries) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Obligor and constitutes, and each of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party when executed and delivered by such Obligor will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against each Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(b) Intellectual Property. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any failure to own or license any such trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property, or any such infringements, that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 4.06. Litigation. (a) Actions, Suits and Proceedings. There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority now pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions (other than the review of the Target Acquisition by the Supreme Court of South Australia and customary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and from or otherwise relating to the Target Acquisition). (b) Disclosed Matters. Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 4.07. Environmental Matters. Except as described in the Disclosed Matters, each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has obtained all environmental, health and
-82- safety permits, licenses and other authorizations required under all Environmental Laws to carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted, except to the extent failure to have any such permit, license or authorization could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

During any period that the Borrower is a public company regulated by, and required to file regular periodic reports with, the Securities and Exchange Commission, any compensation paid to an executive officer of the Borrower or any Subsidiary (who is an Affiliate) which has been specifically approved by the board of directors of the Borrower (or by the Human Resources Committee of the board of directors of the Borrower or other committee responsible for such approval) during such period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower and/or any Subsidiary may enter into so-called split-dollar life insurance agreements with Affiliates, so long as the aggregate amount of premiums payable by the Borrower during any fiscal year pursuant to such agreements shall not exceed U.S.$2,000,000 in the aggregate.

In addition, the Borrower will not enter into, after the date hereof, any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement that, directly or indirectly, prohibits or restrains, or has the effect of prohibiting or restraining, or imposes materially adverse conditions upon the granting of Liens contemplated by Section 6.10; provided that (i) the foregoing shall not apply to restrictions and conditions imposed by law, (ii) the foregoing shall not apply to restrictions or conditions imposed by the Bridge Credit Agreement or any agreement relating to secured Indebtedness permitted by this Agreement if such restrictions or conditions apply only to the property or assets securing such Indebtedness and (iii) the foregoing shall not apply to customary provisions in leases and other contracts restricting the assignment thereof.

Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (d) of Section 7.03, the Borrower will not modify or supplement its Certificate of Incorporation as in effect on the date hereof in any manner materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders without the prior consent of the Administrative Agent (with the approval of the Required Lenders). ARTICLE VIII EVENTS OF DEFAULT If any of the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur: (a) the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at the due date thereof or at a date fixed for prepayment thereof or otherwise; (b) the Borrower shall fail to pay any interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in clause (a) of this Article) payable under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of five or more Business Days; (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any amendment or modification hereof or thereof, or in any report, certificate, financial statement or other document furnished pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any amendment or modification hereof or thereof, shall prove to have been incorrect when made or deemed made in any material respect; (d) the Borrower shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement contained in Section 6.02(a) or (e), 6.03 (with respect to the Borrower's existence), 6.08, 6.11, 6.12 (with respect to covenants, conditions or agreements contained in any fee letter referred to in the Syndication Letter) or in Article VII;

-120- surety or instrument, as the case may be, has not contested liability in respect of such judgment so long as the Borrower or such Subsidiary is seeking to recover under such insurance, bond, surety or similar instrument) shall be rendered against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any combination thereof and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 45 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce any such judgment; (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (m) a reasonable basis shall exist for the assertion against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of (or there shall have been asserted against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) claims or liabilities, whether accrued, absolute or contingent, based on or arising from the generation, storage, transport, handling or disposal of Hazardous Materials by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any predecessor in interest of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or relating to any site or facility owned, operated or leased by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which claims or liabilities (insofar as they are payable by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries but after deducting any portion thereof which is reasonably expected to be paid by other creditworthy Persons jointly and severally liable therefor), in the judgment of the Required Lenders are reasonably likely to be determined adversely to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and the amount thereof is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; (n) a Change in Control shall occur; or (o) any Lien created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected Lien on the collateral intended to be covered thereby (to the extent perfection by filing, registration, recordation or possession is required herein or therein) in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, free and clear of all other Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 7.02 or under the respective Security Documents), or, except for expiration or termination in accordance with its terms, any of the Security Documents shall for whatever reason be terminated or cease to be in full force and effect, or the enforceability thereof shall be contested by any Obligor; then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to any Obligor described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Obligors accrued
-121- hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Obligor; and in case of any event with respect to any Obligor described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Obligors accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Obligor. In the event that any outstanding U.S. Dollar Revolving Loans, Australian Dollar Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans are declared to be, or become, due and payable pursuant to this Article, the Administrative Agent shall calculate the Funding Percentages of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders and the Australian Dollar Revolving Lenders as of the date that such Loans are declared to be, or become, due and payable (the "Acceleration Date") and shall, on or prior to the Business Day next succeeding the Acceleration Date, provide notice of such Funding Percentages to all U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders and Australian Dollar Revolving Lenders, together with a calculation of any amounts required to be paid by the Underfunded Revolving Lenders as provided below. If on the Acceleration Date either (i) the Funding Percentage of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders exceeds the Funding Percentage of the Australian Dollar Revolving Lenders or (ii) the Funding Percentage of the Australian Dollar Revolving Lenders exceeds the Funding Percentage of the U.S. Dollar Revolving Lenders (such Revolving Lenders whose Funding Percentage is so in excess being referred to herein as the "Overfunded Revolving Lenders" and such other Revolving Lenders being referred to herein as the "Underfunded Revolving Lenders"), each Underfunded Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have acquired, on the Acceleration Date, a participation in each outstanding Revolving Loan or Swingline Loan made by, and in the LC Exposure of, each Overfunded Revolving Lender (on a pro rata basis based on the Applicable Percentage of such Underfunded Revolving Lender as of the Acceleration Date) such that, after giving effect thereto, the Funding Percentage of the Overfunded Revolving Lenders is equal to the Funding Percentage of the Underfunded Revolving Lenders. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender and Australian Dollar Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees that, if such Lender is an Underfunded Revolving Lender as provided above, upon receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent as provided above, such Revolving Lender shall on or prior to the date five Business Days after the Acceleration Date pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Overfunded Revolving Lenders, an amount equal to the aggregate purchase price for all of the participations acquired by such Revolving Lender as provided above. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender and Australian Dollar Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and LC Exposure pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default or the reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each U.S. Dollar Revolving Lender and Australian Dollar Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall
-122- apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Overfunded Revolving Lenders (as their interests may appear) the respective amounts so received by it from the Underfunded Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Loans and LC Exposure acquired pursuant to this paragraph. The purchase of participations in any Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof. ARTICLE IX THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LONDON AGENT Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and as its trustee in respect of the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement and the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each of the Australian Dollar Revolving Lenders appoints the London Agent as its agent hereunder. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent or the London Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent or the London Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent or the London Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent or the London Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent, London Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent and the London Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
-123- Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or the London Agent. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent and the London Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent or the London Agent. The Administrative Agent, the London Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent, the London Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent and the London Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent or London Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent or the London Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower (no such consultation being required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent or London Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or London Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or London Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York (or London in the case of the London Agent), or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent or London Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or London Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent or London Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent or London Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
-124- Administrative Agent's or the London Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent or London Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent or London Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the London Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the London Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Without the authorization of the Required Lenders, neither the Administrative Agent nor the London Agent nor any Lender shall send to the Borrower or the Trustee under the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures any notice of a Default or Event of Default hereunder if such notice would result in a payment block in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Administrative Agent in its capacity as trustee or otherwise under the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement and the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements: (a) shall not be liable for any failure, omission, or defect in perfecting the security constituted or created by the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement or the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements including, without limitation, any failure to (i) register the same in accordance with the provisions of any of the documents of title of the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement) to any of the assets thereby charged or (ii) effect or procure registration of or otherwise protect the security created by this deed under any registration laws in any jurisdiction; (b) may accept without inquiry such title as the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement) or the Mortgagor (as defined in each Australian Equity Pledge Agreement) may have to the Shares (as so respectively defined); and (c) shall not be under any obligation to hold any title deed or any other documents in connection with the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement or the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements or to take any steps to protect or preserve the same. The Administrative Agent may permit the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement) or the Mortgagor (as defined in each Australian Equity Pledge Agreement) to retain all such title deeds and other documents in its possession. Except as otherwise provided in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement and the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements, all moneys which under the trusts therein contained are received by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as trustee or otherwise may be invested in the name of or under the control of the Administrative Agent in any investment for the time being authorized by English law (or in the case of the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements,
-125- Australian law) for the investment by trustees of trust money or in any other investments which may be selected by the Administrative Agent. Additionally, the same may be placed on deposit in the name of or under the control of the Administrative Agent at such bank or institution (including JPMorgan Chase) and upon such terms as the Administrative Agent may think fit. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.01. Notices. (a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows: (i) if to the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, to it at 300 WillowBrook Office Park, Fairport, New York 14450, Attention of Thomas Mullin, Esq.

(c) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent and the London Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, the London Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent, the London Agent or the Borrower
-126- may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase any Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) alter the manner in which payments or prepayments of principal, interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders or Types or Classes of Loans, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender or (vi) release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from their guarantee obligations under Article III without the written consent of each Lender; and provided further that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, (y) any modification or supplement of Article III shall require the consent of each Subsidiary Guarantor and (z) subject to the foregoing clause (vi), any Subsidiary Guarantor may
-127- be released from its guarantee obligations under Article III if such Subsidiary Guarantor is the subject of a Disposition permitted by this Agreement or if such Subsidiary Guarantor becomes an Inactive Subsidiary (and any other release of a Subsidiary Guarantor not described in the foregoing clause (vi) may be effected only with the consent of the Required Lenders). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement that has the effect (either immediately or at some later time) of enabling the Borrower to satisfy a condition precedent to the making of a Loan of any Class shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class for purposes of the Commitments of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver or modification, and no waiver or modification of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Lenders of any Class in a manner that does not affect all Classes equally shall be effective against the Lenders of such Class unless the Required Lenders of such Class shall have concurred with such waiver or modification. (c) Amendments to Security Documents. No Security Document nor any provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified, nor may the Liens thereof be spread to secure any additional or other obligations (including any increase in Loans hereunder) of the Obligors except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower or any Subsidiary party thereto, and by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, (i) any provision of the Cash Collateral Pledge Agreement may be waived, amended or modified to the extent provided therein, (ii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the Borrower and Subsidiaries from their respective obligations under the Security Documents and (iii) without the written consent of each Lender, no such agreement shall release all or substantially all of the collateral security or otherwise terminate all or substantially all of the Liens under the Security Documents, alter the relative priorities of the obligations entitled to the Liens created under the Security Documents (except in connection with securing additional or other obligations equally and ratably with the Loans and other obligations hereunder) with respect to all or substantially all of the collateral security provided thereby, except that (A) no such consent shall be required, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized (and so agrees with the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors), to release any Lien covering property (and to release any such Subsidiary Guarantor) that is the subject of either a Disposition permitted hereunder or a Disposition to which the Required Lenders have consented and (B) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. (d) Syndication. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.02 to the contrary, if the syndication of the credit facilities provided by this Agreement has not been completed on or before the date 120 days after the Implementation Date and the Existing Lenders determine that changes to the terms of this Agreement are advisable in order to ensure a successful syndication of such facilities, this Agreement may be amended to the extent provided in the Syndication Letter or in any fee letter referred to therein. With respect to such changes, the Borrower and the Lenders agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.02 or otherwise, no consent of any Lender is required to amend or modify the terms of this
-128- Agreement or any other Loan Document as provided in the previous sentence so long as such amendments and modifications will not adversely affect the Lenders. The Administrative Agent agrees to promptly notify the Lenders of any amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents permitted by this clause (d). SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iv) and all costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration, recording or perfection of any security interest contemplated by any Security Document or any other document referred to therein. (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Lender to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any Property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
-129- determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, an Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, such Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Obligor shall assert, and each Obligor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Participants referred to in paragraph (e) below and the directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents of each of the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s), Loan(s), LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
-130- (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment (x) to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund, (y) if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee or (z) in connection with the syndication contemplated by the Syndication Letter; and (B) the Administrative Agent (and the London Agent in the case of an Australian Dollar Revolving Commitment or Loan), provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent or the London Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment, Loan, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment, Loan, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. (ii) Certain Conditions to Assignments. Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund of such assigning Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment(s), Loan(s), LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the amount of the Commitment(s), Loan(s), LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than U.S.$5,000,000 (or, in the case of any assignment of a Tranche B Terms Loan or Tranche B Term Loan Commitment, U.S.$1,000,000) unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment of any Commitment, Loan, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Commitment, Loan, LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of U.S.$3,500; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (iii) Effectiveness of Assignments. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 10.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
-131- have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 hereof). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section 10.04. (c) Maintenance of Register by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment(s) of, and principal amount of the Loan(s), LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure held by, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04 and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (e) Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more Lenders or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s), Loan(s), LC Exposure and Swingline Exposure held by it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
-132- provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) hereof that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section 10.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 hereof to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 hereof as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) hereof as though it were a Lender hereunder. (f) Limitations on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 hereof than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender. (g) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank or a Farm Credit Bank, and this Section 10.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) No Assignments to the Borrower or Affiliates. Anything in this Section 10.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Commitment, Loan, LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure held by it hereunder to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender. SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the London Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 3.03 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions

SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the obligations of any Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. (a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) Submission to Jurisdiction.

(c) Waiver of Venue. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Syndication Letter in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.

(b) The Borrower hereby agrees that each Subsidiary Guarantor, each Lender, the Administrative Agent and the London Agent (and each of their respective, and their respective affiliates', employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors (collectively, "Agent/Lender Representatives") is, and has been from the commencement of discussions with respect to the facility established by this Agreement (the "Facility"), permitted to disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Facility, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to such Lender, the Administrative Agent, the London Agent or such Subsidiary Guarantor related to such tax treatment and tax structure .

SECTION 10.13. "Credit Agreement" under Indentures; 1999 Credit Agreement. (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes one of the successive renewals, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of the Credit Agreement dated as of June 29, 1993 between the Borrower, the Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified on the signature pages thereof under the caption "Subsidiary Guarantors", the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent, referred to in the definition of "Credit Agreement" in Section 101 of the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures and that, accordingly, this Agreement constitutes the "Credit Agreement" under and as defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indentures. (b) It is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes one of the successive renewals, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of the "Credit Agreement" referred to in each of the indentures listed in Part A of Schedule I, and that, accordingly, this Agreement constitutes the "Credit Agreement" under and as defined in each such indenture. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that compliance by the Borrower with any provision of Article VI or VII would violate or conflict with any provision of the 1999 Credit Agreement, then such provision of Article VI or VII (as applicable) shall have no force or effect until on and after the Effective Date. SECTION 10.14. Judgment Currency. This is an international loan transaction in which the specification of U.S. Dollars, Australian Dollars or an Alternative Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Currency"), and any payment in New York County or the country of the Specified Currency, as the case may be (the "Specified Place"), is of the essence, and the Specified Currency shall be the currency of account in all events relating to Loans denominated in the Specified Currency. The payment obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall not be discharged by an amount paid in another currency or in another place, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on conversion to the Specified Currency and transfer to the Specified Place under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount of the Specified Currency at the Specified Place due hereunder. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in the Specified Currency into another currency (the "Second Currency"), the rate of exchange which shall be applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Applicable Agent could purchase the Specified Currency with the Second Currency on the Business Day next preceding that on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Applicable Agent or any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the Second Currency to the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase and transfer to
-137- the Specified Place the Specified Currency with the amount of the Second Currency so adjudged to be due; and the Borrower hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against, and to pay the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on demand in the Specified Currency, any difference between the sum originally due to the Applicable Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, in the Specified Currency and the amount of the Specified Currency so purchased and transferred. SECTION 10.15. Cleanup Period. The Lenders and the Administrative Agent acknowledge and agree that if, at any time during the period (herein, the "Cleanup Period") commencing on the Effective Date through but not including the 60th day following the Effective Date, the Borrower shall fail to cause the Target or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with any of the covenants herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, or if any of the representations or warranties made herein or in any of the other Loan Documents (or in any report, financial statement, certificate or other document furnished in connection herewith or therewith) by or on behalf of the Target or any of its Subsidiaries shall prove to have been incorrect in any material respect, then, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such failure to comply with covenants (other than any such failure that is caused or authorized by the Borrower, it being understood that mere knowledge of a failure to comply shall not constitute authorization for purposes hereof) and any such incorrectness with respect to representations or warranties shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder until after the expiration of the Cleanup Period (and then only to the extent that the same is continuing). SECTION 10.16. Delivery of Lender Addenda. Each Lender (other than the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Lender) shall become a party to this Agreement by delivering to the Administrative Agent a Lender Addendum duly executed by such Lender and the Borrower and, by executing its Lender Addendum, each such Lender agrees to be bound by the provisions hereof with the Commitments set forth opposite its name in such Lender Addendum.

The commitments of the Lenders to make the Bridge Loans to Borrower pursuant to this subsection 2.01(a) are herein called individually, a "Bridge Loan Commitment" and collectively, the "Bridge Loan Commitments." (b) Notice of Borrowing. Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time), at least one Business Day in advance of the Funding Date or such later time as shall be agreed to by the Administrative Agent. The Notice of Borrowing shall specify the date of borrowing (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount to be borrowed. Upon receipt of the Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its share of the Bridge Loans and the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing. (c) Disbursement of Funds. (i) No later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the Funding Date, each Lender shall make available its pro rata share of the Bridge Loans in the manner provided below. All amounts shall be made available to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly make available to Borrower by depositing to an account designated by Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made available in the type of funds received. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the Funding
-30- Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent its portion of the Bridge Loans, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to it on such date, and the Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, and the Administrative Agent has made available the same to Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon demand therefor by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower, and Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender and/or Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (x) if paid by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (y) if paid by Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest on the Bridge Loans. (ii) Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Bridge Loan Commitment hereunder or to prejudice any rights which Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. (d) Bridge Notes. Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender (upon request by such Lender) on the Funding Date a Bridge Note dated the Funding Date substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to evidence the portion of the Bridge Loan made by such Lender and with appropriate insertions (collectively, the "Bridge Notes"). (e) Scheduled Repayment of Bridge Loan. Subject to Sections 2.02, 2.06 and 5.03, Borrower shall repay in full the outstanding amount of Bridge Loans and all other Obligations owing hereunder on the Initial Maturity Date by way of conversion into Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.02. (f) Termination of Bridge Loan Commitments. The Bridge Loan Commitments shall automatically and permanently terminate in their entirety on the earlier of (i) the Funding Date immediately after the making of the Bridge Loans and (ii) the termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02. (g) Pro Rata Borrowings. The Bridge Loans shall be made by the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective Bridge Loan Commitments. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make its portion of the Bridge Loan hereunder and that each Lender shall be obligated to make its portion of the Bridge Loan hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder.
-31- SECTION 2.02. Term Loans and Term Notes. (a) Term Loan Commitment. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 5.03, the Lenders hereby agree that on the Initial Maturity Date, all of the then outstanding Bridge Loans not converted to Exchange Notes pursuant to Section 2.06 shall convert into term loans (the "Term Loans") and shall thereupon be deemed to be indefeasibly repaid hereunder, such Term Loans to be in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Loans not converted to Exchange Notes pursuant to Section 2.06. The commitments of Lenders to permit the conversion of the Bridge Loans to Term Loans under this subsection 2.02(a) are herein called individually, a "Term Loan Commitment" and collectively, the "Term Loan Commitments." (b) Notice of Conversion. If Borrower has not repaid and does not intend to repay the Bridge Loans in full on or prior to the Initial Maturity Date, then Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Conversion no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time), at least one Business Day in advance of the Initial Maturity Date. The Notice of Conversion shall specify the principal amount of the Bridge Loans to be outstanding on the Initial Maturity Date to be converted into Term Loans. (c) Making of Term Loans. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.03, each Lender shall extend to Borrower the Term Loans to be made on the Initial Maturity Date by such Lender by canceling on its records a corresponding principal amount of the Bridge Loans held by such Lender, which corresponding principal amounts of Bridge Loans shall be satisfied by the conversion into Term Loans in accordance with this Section 2.02. (d) Maturity of Term Loans. The Term Loans shall mature and Borrower shall pay in full the outstanding principal amount thereof and accrued interest thereon on the Final Maturity Date. (e) Term Notes. Borrower shall execute and deliver to each Lender (upon request by such Lender) on the Initial Maturity Date a Term Note dated the Initial Maturity Date substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to evidence the Term Loan made on such date, in the principal amount of the Bridge Notes held by such Lender on such date and with other appropriate insertions (collectively, the "Term Notes"). SECTION 2.03. Interest on the Loans. (a) Rate of Interest. The Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date made through maturity (whether by prepayment, acceleration or otherwise) at a rate determined as set forth below:
-32- (i) Bridge Loans. The Bridge Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (adjusted on the first day of each Interest Period) plus the Applicable Bridge Spread and (ii) the highest interest rate then applicable to the Tranche B Term Loans under the Credit Agreement at any time, plus 75 basis points; provided, that if at any time after the Execution Date and prior to the Initial Maturity Date Borrower's senior unsecured credit rating drops below either (i) BB- by Standard & Poor's or (ii) Ba3 by Moody's, then the Applicable Bridge Spread shall be increased by (a) 50 basis points if Borrower's senior secured credit rating is at least B+ by Standard & Poor's and B1 by Moody's or (b) 100 basis points in all other cases, in each case effective as of the date of the relevant drop in credit rating. (ii) Term Loans. The Term Loans shall bear interest at the rate of interest borne by the Bridge Loans on the Initial Maturity Date plus the Applicable Term Spread. (iii) Maximum Interest. Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii) of this subsection 2.03(a) or any other provision herein, in no event will the interest on the Loans (other than post-maturity interest pursuant to subsection 2.03(c)) exceed 11.50% per annum. In no event will the interest rate on the Loans exceed the highest rate permitted under applicable law. (b) Interest Payments. Interest shall be payable (i) with respect to the Bridge Loans, in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 and upon any prepayment of the Bridge Loans (to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity of the Bridge Loans in respect of any amounts paid on such date and not converted to Exchange Notes or Term Loans; and (ii) with respect to the Term Loans, in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, commencing on the first of such dates to follow the Initial Maturity Date, and upon any prepayment of the Term Loans (to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid) and at maturity of the Term Loans. (c) Post-Maturity Interest. Any principal payments on the Loans not paid when due and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payment on the Loans not paid when due, in each case whether at Final Maturity Date, by notice of prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate which is 2.0% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement for the Loans.
-33- (d) Computation of Interest. Interest on the Loans shall be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed in a year of 360 days. In computing interest on the Loans, the date of the making of the Loans shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan. SECTION 2.04. Fee Letter. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and certain of its Affiliates all fees, expenses and other obligations specified in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter at the times specified therein. Except as otherwise provided in the Fee Letter or in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter, the fees or any part thereof payable hereunder and under the Fee Letter and the Administrative Agent Fee Letter will not be refundable under any circumstances, regardless of whether the transactions or borrowings contemplated hereby are consummated.

-35- payment to the last day of the Interest Period in which Borrower receives such Net Debt Proceeds. B. Net Equity Proceeds. Concurrently with the receipt by the Borrower of any Net Equity Proceeds (other than Net Equity Proceeds received from the issuance or sale of capital stock in connection with Stock Based Plans in effect from time to time), the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a calculation of the amount of such Net Equity Proceeds and make a mandatory prepayment of the Bridge Loans or Prepayable Term Loans in an amount equal to 100% of such Net Equity Proceeds; provided that, in the case of Loans the interest rate of which is determined by reference to Adjusted LIBO, Borrower may defer payment to the last day of the Interest Period in which Borrower receives such Net Equity Proceeds. C. Pro Rata Prepayment with Mandatory Redemption of Prepayable Exchange Notes. If any Prepayable Exchange Notes are outstanding, any prepayment pursuant to clause (A) or (B) above shall be made pro rata with any mandatory redemption of Prepayable Exchange Notes required by the Exchange Note Indenture. D. Notice. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any prepayment to be made pursuant to subsection 2.05(a)(ii) at least two Business Days prior to such prepayment date (unless shorter notice is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent).

All prepayments shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount so prepaid and shall be applied to payment of interest before application to principal. (iv) Mandatory Offers to Repay Loans. A. Mandatory Offer to Repay Term Loans on Change of Control. (1) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Initial Maturity Date, each Lender shall have the right to require that the Borrower repay such Lender's Term Loans in an amount in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of repayment plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, such date of repayment (the "Change of Control Repayment Date"). (2) Within five days following any Change of Control after the Initial Maturity Date, the Borrower shall mail a notice to each Lender with a copy to the Administrative Agent (the "Change of Control Offer") stating: (w) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Lender has the right to require the Borrower to repay such Lender's Term Loans in an amount in cash
-36- equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the Change of Control Repayment Date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the Change of Control Repayment Date; (x) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control; (y) the Change of Control Repayment Date (which shall be 14 days after such notice is mailed); and (z) the instructions, as determined by the Borrower, consistent with this subsection 2.05(a)(iv)(A), that a Lender must follow in order to have its Term Loans repaid. (3) Lenders electing to have a Term Loan repaid shall be required to surrender the applicable Term Note (if any) to the Borrower at the address specified in the notice at least two Business Days prior to the Change of Control Repayment Date. (4) On the repayment date, all Term Notes (if any) evidencing Term Loans to be repaid by the Borrower under this subsection 2.05(a)(iv)(A) shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and Borrower shall repay the loans in the amount in cash set forth in clause (1) above plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Term Loans to be repaid to the Lenders entitled thereto. (5) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist or become effective any restriction (other than restrictions existing under Indebtedness as in effect on the date of this Agreement) that would materially impair the ability of the Borrower to make a Change of Control Offer to repay the Loans or, if such Change of Control Offer is made, to repay the Loans tendered for repayment. B. Mandatory Offer to Repay Bridge Loans and Term Loans with Net Cash Proceeds. (1) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds equals $10,000,000 or more, the Borrower shall apply the Excess Proceeds to the repayment of the Loans and any Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid under the instrument governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness as follows: (a) the Borrower shall make an offer to repay (an "Excess Proceeds Offer") the Loans of all Lenders in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement in the maximum principal amount (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of Loans that may be repaid out of an amount (the "Loan Amount") equal to the product of such Excess Proceeds multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, and the denominator of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Loans and such Pari Passu Indebtedness (subject to proration in the event such amount is less than the aggregate Offered Price (as defined below) of all Loans tendered) and (b) to the ex-
-37- tent required by such Pari Passu Indebtedness to permanently reduce the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Borrower shall make an offer to repay or otherwise repurchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness (a "Pari Passu Offer") in an amount (the "Pari Passu Debt Amount") equal to the excess of the Excess Proceeds over the Loan Amount; provided that in no event shall the Pari Passu Debt Amount exceed the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus the amount of any premium required to be paid to repay or otherwise repurchase or redeem such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Loans shall be repaid in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Loans plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date (the "Offer Date") such Excess Proceeds Offer is consummated (the "Offered Price"), in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement. To the extent that the aggregate Offered Price of the Loans tendered pursuant to the Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the Loan Amount relating thereto or the aggregate amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness that is repaid or otherwise repurchased or redeemed is less than the Pari Passu Debt Amount (the amount of such shortfall, if any, constituting a "Deficiency"), the Borrower shall use such Deficiency in the business of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon completion of the repayment of all the Loans tendered pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer and the repayment, repurchase or redemption of the Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to a Pari Passu Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be reset at zero. (2) If the Borrower becomes obligated to make an Excess Proceeds Offer pursuant to paragraph (1) above, the Loans shall be repaid by the Borrower, at the option of the Lenders, in whole or in part in integral multiples of $1,000,000, on a date that is 14 days from the date notice is given to Lenders, subject to proration in the event the Loan Amount is less than the aggregate Offered Price of all Loans tendered. (3) Subject to paragraph (1) above, within 5 days after the date on which the amount of Excess Proceeds equals or exceeds $10,000,000, the Borrower shall mail a notice to each Lender with a copy to the Administrative Agent stating: (i) that the Lender has the right to require the Borrower to repay, subject to proration, such Lender's Loans at the Offered Price; (ii) the Offer Date (which shall not be later than the date that any Pari Passu Indebtedness or Exchange Notes are repaid with such Excess Proceeds); (iii) the instructions, as determined by the Borrower, consistent with this subsection 2.05(a)(iv)(B), that a Lender must follow in order to have its Bridge Loans or Term Loans repaid; and (iv) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Excess Proceeds Offer.
-38- (4) Lenders electing to have a Loan repaid shall be required to surrender the applicable Note (if any) to the Borrower at the address specified in the notice at least three Business Days prior to the repayment date. (5) On the repayment date, all Notes (if any) evidencing Loans to be repaid by the Borrower under this subsection 2.05(a)(iv)(B) shall be delivered by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and the Borrower shall repay the Loans in the amount in cash set forth in clause (1) above plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Loans to be repaid to the Lenders entitled thereto. (6) If any Exchange Notes are outstanding, any offer to repay the Loans pursuant to this subsection 2.05(a)(iv)(B) shall be made pro rata with any offer to purchase required by the Exchange Note Indenture. (a) Manner and Time of Payment. All payments of principal and interest and fees hereunder and under the Notes by the Borrower shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim and in same-day funds and delivered to the Administrative Agent, unless otherwise specified, not later than 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date due at the Payment Office for the account of the Lenders; funds received by the Administrative Agent after that time shall be deemed to have been paid by the Borrower on the next succeeding Business Day. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to charge its account with the Administrative Agent in order to cause timely payment to be made of all principal, interest and fees due hereunder (subject to sufficient funds being available in its account for that purpose). (b) Payments on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of interest hereunder or under the Notes or of the commitment and other fees hereunder, as the case may be. (c) Notation of Payment. Each Lender agrees that before disposing of any Note held by it, or any part thereof (other than by granting participations therein), such Lender will make a notation thereon of all principal payments previously made thereon and of the date to which interest thereon has been paid and will notify the Borrower of the name and address of the transferee of that Note; provided, however, that the failure to make (or any error in the making of) such a notation or to notify the Borrower of the name and address of such transferee shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under such Notes with respect to the Loans and payments of principal or interest on any such Note (it being understood that the transferee takes subject to the defense of payment as to any payment made but not noted).
-39- (d) Payments in Dollars. All payments of any Obligations to be made hereunder or under the Notes by the Borrower or any other obligor with respect thereto shall be made solely in Dollars or such other currency as is then legal tender for public and private debts in the United States of America. (e) Register. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower's agent to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Loans made by each Lender and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect of such Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to ownership of such Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of any Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 10.04. Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and Acceptance to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note evidencing such Loan, if any, and thereupon one or more new Notes of the same type and in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender upon the request of such Lender. (f) Pro Rata Treatment of Payments. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by the relevant Lenders; and (ii) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations; pro-
-40- vided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Obligor rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Obligor in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.06. Exchange of Loans for Exchange Notes. (a) Exchange Notes; Exchange Note Indenture. On the Initial Maturity Date following the written request of a Lender of a Bridge Loan given not less than ten and not more than 30 Business Days prior to the Initial Maturity Date to exchange all or a portion of such Lender's Bridge Loans for Exchange Notes, or on the tenth Business Day following the written request of the Lenders of any Term Loan to exchange all or a portion of such Lender's Term Loans for Exchange Notes (any such notice, an "Exchange Request"), the Borrower will: (i) Execute and deliver, cause the Guarantors to execute and deliver, and cause an Eligible Trust Company to execute and deliver as trustee on behalf of holders of Exchange Notes, the Exchange Note Indenture if the Exchange Note Indenture has not previously been executed and delivered by such party; (ii) Execute and deliver to such holder in accordance with the Exchange Note Indenture one or more Exchange Notes in exchange for the Loans or portion thereof being exchanged, which Exchange Notes shall be dated the date of issuance thereof, payable to the order of such holder or owner, as the case may be, in the same principal amount as the Loans or portion thereof being exchanged, and cause each Guarantor to endorse its guarantee thereon; and (iii) Execute and deliver, and cause the Guarantors to execute and deliver, the Exchange Note Registration Rights Agreement if the Exchange Note Registration Rights Agreement has not previously been executed and delivered by such party or, if the Exchange Note Registration Rights Agreement has previously been executed and delivered and such holder is not already a party thereto, permit such holder to become a party thereto.
-41- (b) Exchange Request; Cancellation of Notes. The Exchange Request shall specify the principal amount of Loans to be exchanged pursuant to this Section 2.06, which shall be at least $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if any Lender holds Loans with an outstanding amount less than $1,000,000, such remaining amount). On the date of issuance of Exchange Notes, the requesting Lender shall deliver the Notes, if any, evidencing the Loans or portion thereof to be exchanged. Upon issuance of the Exchange Notes, any Notes so delivered shall be canceled by Borrower and the corresponding amount of the Loans deemed repaid. SECTION 2.07. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period: (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) for such Interest Period; then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, such Loans shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Bridge Spread or Applicable Term Spread, as the case may be, less 100 basis points. SECTION 2.08. Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce
-42- the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company, if any, with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Certificates from Lenders. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate, in the case of any amount payable as specified in paragraph (a) of this Section, shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount). The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. SECTION 2.09. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default, voluntary or optional prepayment or offer to repay), or (b) the failure to borrow or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (including such loss, cost and expense as calculated below but otherwise excluding any lost profit): the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit
-43- equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, borrowing, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for deposits in U.S. Dollars from other banks in the eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate to include in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount or amounts). The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.10. Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Covered Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower or such Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower or such Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower or such Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be
-44- conclusive absent manifest error (such certificate to include in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount). (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower or any Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (e) Foreign Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, the properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) Refund. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Tax or Other Tax as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or any Guarantor under this Section 2.10, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower or such Guarantor (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or such Guarantor under this Section 2.10 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower or such Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or such Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Government Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person. SECTION 2.11. Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.08, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.10, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.10, as
-45- the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. ARTICLE III GUARANTEE SECTION 3.01. The Guarantee. The Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, guarantee to each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors hereby further agree, jointly and severally, that if the Borrower shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations in respect of which such Guarantor is obligated, such Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of such Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

In full recognition and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Guarantor agrees that: (a) Without affecting the enforceability or effectiveness of Section 3.01 in accordance with its terms and without affecting, limiting, reducing, discharging or terminating the liability of such Guarantor, or the rights, remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at any time and from time to time and without notice or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever: (i) amend, supplement, modify, extend, renew, waive, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or performance of, or the terms of, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase

(b) The enforceability and effectiveness of this Article and the liability of the Guarantors, and the rights remedies, powers and privileges of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument re-
-48- ferred to herein or therein, shall not be affected, limited, reduced, discharged or terminated, and each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any defense now or in the future arising, by reason of: (i) the illegality, invalidity, irregularity, authenticity, or unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any agreement, security document, guarantee or other instrument relative to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other Guarantor with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (including any issuer of any letters of credit), including the effect of any statute of limitations that may bar the enforcement of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or the obligations of any such other guarantor; (iii) the illegality, invalidity, irregularity, authenticity or unenforceability of any security or guarantee (including any letter of credit) for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of the priority of any lien on any collateral for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) the cessation, for any cause whatsoever, of the liability of the Borrower or any other Guarantor (other than subject to Section 3.05, by reason of the full payment and performance of all Guaranteed Obligations); (v) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to marshal assets in favor of the Borrower or any other Person (including any other guarantor), to exhaust any collateral for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, to pursue or exhaust any right, remedy, power or privilege it may have against any other Guarantor, the Borrower, any other guarantor, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person or to take any action whatsoever to mitigate or reduce such or any other Guarantor's liability under this Article, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender being under any obligation to take any such action notwithstanding the fact that all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations may be due and payable and that the Borrower may be in default of its obligations under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein; (vi) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give notice after any Default of sale or other disposition of any collateral (including any notice of any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or sale of any in-
-49- terest in real Property serving as collateral for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations) for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person or any defect in, or any failure by any Guarantor or any other Person to receive, any notice that may be given in connection with any sale or disposition of any collateral; (vii) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with applicable laws in connection with the sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, including any failure to conduct a commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of any collateral for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (viii) any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure or sale of, or other election of remedies with respect to, any interest in real Property or other collateral serving as security for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, even though such foreclosure, sale or election of remedies may impair the subrogation rights of any Guarantor or may preclude any Guarantor from obtaining reimbursement, contribution, indemnification or other recovery from any other Guarantor, the Borrower any other guarantor or any other Person and even though the Borrower may not, as a result of such foreclosure, sale or election of remedies, be liable for any deficiency; (ix) any benefits the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other guarantor may otherwise derive from Sections 580(a), 580(b), 580(d) or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction; (x) any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other person that directly or indirectly results in or aids the discharge or release of the Borrower or any other Guarantor, of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security or guarantee (including any letter of credit) for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations by operation of law or otherwise; (xi) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety's principal obligation; (xii) the possibility that the obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may at any time and from time to time exceed the aggregate liability of the Guarantors under this Article;
-50- (xiii) any counterclaim, set-off or other claim which either Borrower or any other Guarantor has or alleges to have with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (xiv) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any Person; (xv) the election by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in a bankruptcy proceeding of any Person, of the application or nonapplication of Section 1111(b)(2) of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xvi) any extension of credit or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xvii) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code; (xviii) any agreement or stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding of any Person; (xix) the avoidance of any lien in favor of the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any reason; (xx) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Person, including any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any interest on all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations) in or as a result of any such proceeding; (xxi) any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, including by reason of Sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2839, 2845, 2850, 2899, 3275 and 3433 of the California Civil Code, and any future judicial decisions or legislation or of any comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction; or (xxii) diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever. (c) Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent that it has established adequate means of obtaining financial and other information
-51- pertaining to the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of the Borrower in respect of whose Guaranteed Obligations it is obligated as a Guarantor and its properties on a continuing basis and that such Guarantor is now and will in the future remain fully familiar with the business, operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of the Borrower and its properties. Each Guarantor further represents and warrants that it has reviewed and approved this Agreement and the related Loan Documents and is fully familiar with the transactions contemplated by such Loan Documents and that it will in the future remain fully familiar with such transaction and with any new Loan Documents and the transaction contemplated by such Loan Documents. Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders (should any such duty exist) to disclose to such or any other Guarantor any matter of fact or other information related to the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower or its properties or to any Loan Documents or the transactions undertaken pursuant to, or contemplated by, such Loan Documents, whether now or in the future known by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. SECTION 3.03. Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Guarantors jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law. SECTION 3.04. Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby waives all rights of subrogation or contribution, whether arising by contract or operation of law (including any such right arising under Bankruptcy Law) or otherwise by reason of any payment by it pursuant to the provisions of this Article until such time as the obligations under this Agreement have been indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full and the Commitments have terminated. Each Guarantor understands that, by reason of the foregoing provisions of this Section, the exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of the rights, remedies, powers and privileges that it has under this Article and under the other Loan Documents will result in nonreimbursable liabilities under this Agreement. Nevertheless, each Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to exercise, in its or their sole discretion, any combination of such rights, remedies, powers and privileges as they, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.
-52- SECTION 3.05. Remedies. Each Guarantor agrees, jointly and severally, that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against the Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Borrower) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 3.01. SECTION 3.06. Instrument for the Payment of Money. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article constitutes an instrument for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or the Administrative Agent, at its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring motion-action under New York CPLR Section 3213. SECTION 3.07. Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising. SECTION 3.08. Rights of Contribution. The Guarantors hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Guarantor shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this Section shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Article and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations. For purposes of this Section, (i) "Excess Funding Guarantor" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) "Excess Payment" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "Pro Rata Share" means, for any Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all properties of such Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any other Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including
-53- contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any other Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of all of the Guarantors exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors hereunder and under the other Loan Documents) of all of the Guarantors, determined (A) with respect to any Guarantor that is a party hereto on the Effective Date, as of the Effective Date, and (B) with respect to any other Guarantor, as of the date such Guarantor becomes a Guarantor hereunder. SECTION 3.09. General Limitation on Guarantee Obligations. In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, Federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally (including "financial assistance" rules under the laws of England, including Sections 151 to and including 158 of the Companies Act), if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 3.01 would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.08, be held or determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section 3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or proceeding (or, in the case of Canandaigua Limited, be limited so as not to guarantee the portion of the Loans that are not permitted to be guaranteed under such "financial assistance" rules). ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that (subject to Section 10.14): SECTION 4.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding Inactive Subsidiaries) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required. SECTION 4.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are within each Obligor's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, by all necessary shareholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed
-54- and delivered by each Obligor and constitutes, and each of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party when executed and delivered by such Obligor will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against each Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws of general applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). SECTION 4.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) in the case of the Target Acquisition, as specified in Section 1.4(c)(i) of Schedule 1 of the Implementation Deed, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any such Person, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

Properties. (a) Property Generally. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (excluding Inactive Subsidiaries) has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal Properties material to its business, except for minor defects in title or leasehold interests that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such Properties for their intended purposes or where failure to have such title or interest could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or Liens permitted to be incurred under Section 7.02. (b) Intellectual Property. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any failure to own or license any such trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property, or any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 4.06. Litigation. (a) Actions, Suits and Proceedings. There are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority now pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions (other than the review of Target Acquisition by the Supreme Court of South Australia and customary proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and from or otherwise relating to the Target Acquisition). (b) Disclosed Matters. Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.

Except as described in the Disclosed Matters, each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has obtained all environmental, health and safety permits, licenses and other authorizations required under all Environmental Laws to carry on its business as now being or as proposed to be conducted, except to the extent failure to have any such permit, license or authorization could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of such permits, licenses and authorizations is in full
-56- force and effect and each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms and conditions thereof, and is also in compliance with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions, standards, prohibitions, requirements, obligations, schedules and timetables contained in any applicable Environmental Law or in any regulation, code, plan, order, decree, judgment, injunction, notice or demand letter issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder, except as described in Disclosed Matters and except to the extent failure to comply therewith could not (either individually or in the aggregate) reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Borrower or any Guarantor (except, in the case of a Guarantor, pursuant to a transaction set forth in the last paragraph of subsection 7.03(b)) in accordance with Section 7.03, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, is merged or the successor Person to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans and Notes and/or the Guarantees, as the case may be, with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, herein, the other Loan Documents, or the Loans and Notes and/or in the Guarantees, as the case may be. When a successor assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Loans and Notes or a Guarantee, as the case may be, the predecessor shall be released from those obligations; provided that in the case of a transfer by lease, the predecessor shall not be released from the payment of principal and interest on the Loans and Notes or a Guarantee, as the case may be. SECTION 7.04. Limitation on Sale of Assets. (a) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale (other than an Asset Swap permitted by clause (d) below of this Section 7.04) unless (i) at least 75% of the proceeds from such Asset Sale are received in cash; provided, however, that the amount of (A) any liabilities (as shown on the Borrower's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or the notes thereto) of the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary that are assumed by the transferee in such Asset Sale and from which the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary is released and (B) any notes or other obligations received by the Borrower or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are immediately converted by the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash, shall be deemed cash for purposes of this Section 7.04, and (ii) the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of
-84- the shares or assets sold (other than in the case of an involuntary Asset Sale, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Borrower and evidenced in a board resolution). (b) If all or a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale are not required to be applied to repay permanently any secured Indebtedness then outstanding as required by the terms thereof, or the Borrower determines not to apply such Net Cash Proceeds to the permanent prepayment of such secured Indebtedness or if no such secured Indebtedness is then outstanding, then the Borrower may within 12 months of the Asset Sale, invest the Net Cash Proceeds in other properties and assets that (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Borrower) replace the properties and assets that were the subject of the Asset Sale or in properties and assets that will be used in the businesses of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries as existing at such time or reasonably related thereto. The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds neither used to permanently repay or prepay secured Indebtedness nor used or invested as set forth in this paragraph constitutes "Excess Proceeds." The Borrower will cause such Excess Proceeds to be used as required by Section 2.05(a)(iv)(B). (c) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create or permit to exist or become effective any restriction (other than restrictions existing under Indebtedness as in effect on the date of this Agreement as such Indebtedness may be refinanced from time to time, provided that such restrictions are no less favorable to the Lenders than those existing on the date of this Agreement) that would materially impair the ability of the Borrower to make an Offer to repay the Loans and Notes as required by Section 2.05(a)(iv)(B) or, if such Offer is made, to repay the Loans and Notes tendered for repayment. (d) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any Asset Swaps, unless: (i) at the time of entering into such Asset Swap, and immediately after giving effect to such Asset Swap, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (ii) in the event such Asset Swap involves an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000,000, the terms of such Asset Swap have been approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Borrower which determination shall include a determination that the Fair Market Value of the assets being received in such swap are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets being swapped and (iii) in the event such Asset Swap involves an aggregate amount in excess of $20,000,000, the Borrower has also received a written opinion from an independent investment banking firm of nationally recognized standing that such Asset Swap is fair to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a financial point of view. SECTION 7.05. Limitation on Restricted Payments. (a) The Borrower will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly: (i) declare or pay any dividend on, or make any distribution to holders of, any shares of the Borrower's Capital Stock (other than dividends or distributions
-85- payable solely in shares of its Qualified Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Qualified Capital Stock); (ii) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value, directly or indirectly, any shares of the Capital Stock of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (other than any Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower) or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock; (iii) make any principal payment on, or repurchase, redeem, defease, retire or otherwise acquire for value, prior to any scheduled principal payment, sinking fund or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness; (iv) declare or pay any dividend or distribution on any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary to any Person (other than the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary held by any Person (other than the Borrower or any of its Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiaries); (v) Incur, create or assume any guarantee of Indebtedness of any Affiliate (other than a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower); or (vi) make any Investment in any Person (other than any Permitted Investments) (any of the foregoing payments described in clauses (i) through (vi), other than any such action that is a Permitted Payment, collectively, "Restricted Payments") unless after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment (the amount of any such Restricted Payment, if other than cash, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Borrower, whose determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a board resolution), (1) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and such Restricted Payment shall not be an event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both, would be, an "event of default" under the terms of any Indebtedness of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries; (2) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, the Borrower could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) under the provisions contained in Section 7.01, and (3) the aggregate amount of all such Restricted Payments declared or made after the Effective Date does not exceed the sum of: (A) 50% of the aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income (Loss) of the Borrower accrued on a cumulative basis during the period beginning on the Trigger Date and ending on the last day of the Borrower's last fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of the Restricted Payment (or, if such aggregate cumulative Consolidated Net Income (Loss) shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss); plus
-86- (B) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received after the Trigger Date by the Borrower from the issuance or sale (other than to any of its Subsidiaries) of its shares of Qualified Capital Stock or any options, warrants or rights to purchase such shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Borrower (except, in each case, to the extent such proceeds are used to purchase, redeem or otherwise retire Capital Stock or Subordinated Indebtedness as set forth below); plus (C) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received after the Trigger Date by the Borrower (other than from any of its Subsidiaries) upon the exercise of any options or warrants to purchase shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Borrower; plus (D) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received after the Trigger Date by the Borrower from debt securities or Redeemable Capital Stock that has been converted into or exchanged for Qualified Capital Stock of the Borrower to the extent such debt securities or Redeemable Capital Stock are originally sold for cash plus the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Borrower at the time of such conversion or exchange; plus (E) in the event the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary has made since the Trigger Date or makes an Investment in a Person that, as a result of or in connection with such Investment, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to the Borrower's or any Restricted Subsidiary's existing Investment in such Person that was previously treated as a Restricted Payment; plus (F) so long as the Designation thereof was treated as a Restricted Payment made after the Trigger Date, with respect to any Unrestricted Subsidiary that has been redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after the Effective Date in accordance with Section 7.10, an amount equal to the Borrower's Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary (provided that such amount shall not in any case exceed the Designation Amount with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary upon its Designation); plus (G) $50,000,000; minus (H) the Designation Amount (measured as of the date of Designation) with respect to any Subsidiary of the Borrower which has been designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Trigger Date in accordance with Section 7.10; minus (I) for any calculation after the Initial Maturity Date only, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments made after November 17, 1999 through the Effective Date. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) below, so long as there is no Default or Event of Default continuing, the foregoing provi-
-87- sions shall not prohibit the following actions (clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Permitted Payment"): (i) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at such date of declaration such payment would be permitted by the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 7.05 and such payment shall be deemed to have been paid on such date of declaration for purposes of the calculation required by paragraph (a) of this Section 7.05; (ii) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement of any shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Borrower in exchange for (including any such exchange pursuant to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege or in which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares or scrip), or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issue and sale for cash (other than to a Subsidiary) of other shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Borrower; provided that the Net Cash Proceeds from the issuance of such shares of Qualified Capital Stock are excluded from clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) of this Section 7.05; (iii) any repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement, refinancing or acquisition for value or payment of principal of any Subordinated Indebtedness in exchange for, or out of the Net Cash Proceeds of, a substantially concurrent issuance and sale for cash (other than to any Subsidiary of the Borrower) of any Qualified Capital Stock of the Borrower, provided that the Net Cash Proceeds from the issuance of such shares of Qualified Capital Stock are excluded from clause (3)(B) of paragraph (a) of this Section 7.05; (iv) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance, retirement, refinancing or acquisition for value or payment of principal of any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than Redeemable Capital Stock) (a "refinancing") through the issuance of new Subordinated Indebtedness of the Borrower, provided that any such new Subordinated Indebtedness (1) shall be in a principal amount that does not exceed the principal amount so refinanced (or, if such Subordinated Indebtedness provides for an amount less than the principal amount thereof to be due and payable upon a declaration or acceleration thereof, then such lesser amount as of the date of determination), plus the lesser of (x) the stated amount of any premium, interest or other payment required to be paid in connection with such a refinancing pursuant to the terms of the Indebtedness being refinanced or (y) the amount of premium, interest or other payment actually paid at such time to refinance the Indebtedness, plus, in either case, the amount of expenses of the Borrower Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (2) has an Average Life to Stated Maturity greater than the remaining Average Life to Stated Maturity of the Loans and the Notes; (3) has a Stated Maturity for its final scheduled principal payment later than the Stated Maturity for the final scheduled principal payment of the
-88- Loans and the Notes; and (4) is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Loans and the Notes at least to the same extent as the Indebtedness to be refinanced. SECTION 7.06. Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions (including, without limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets, property or services) with any Affiliate of the Borrower (other than the Borrower or a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary) unless: (i) such transaction or series of transactions is in writing on terms that are no less favorable to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than would be available in a comparable transaction in arm's-length dealings with an unrelated third party; (ii) with respect to any transaction or series of transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of $10,000,000, the Borrower delivers an officers' certificate to the Administrative Agent certifying that such transaction or series of related transactions complies with clause (i) above and such transaction or series of related transactions has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Borrower; and (iii) with respect to a transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate value in excess of $25,000,000, the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent an opinion of an independent investment banking firm of national standing in the United States, or an independent public accounting firm of national standing in the United States, stating that the transaction or series of transactions is fair to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to any transaction with an officer or director of the Borrower entered into in the ordinary course of business (including compensation or employee benefit arrangements with any officer or director of the Borrower). SECTION 7.07. Limitation on Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries. (a) In the event the Borrower (i) organizes or acquires any Domestic Restricted Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement that is not a Guarantor and causes or permits such Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness ("Other Indebtedness") of the Borrower or any Guarantor or (ii) causes or permits any Foreign Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, guarantee the payment of any Other Indebtedness, then, in each case the Borrower shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to simultaneously execute and deliver a Guarantee Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it will become a Guarantor under this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event a Domestic Restricted Subsidiary is acquired in a transaction in which a merger agreement is entered into, such Domestic Restricted Subsidiary shall not be required to execute and deliver such Guarantee Assumption Agreement until the consummation of the merger contemplated by any such merger agreement; provided, further, that if such Other Indebtedness is (i) In-
-89- debtedness that is ranked pari passu in right of payment with the Loans and the Notes or the Guarantees of such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, the Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary shall be pari passu in right of payment with the guarantee of the Other Indebtedness; or (ii) Subordinated Indebtedness, the Guarantees of such Restricted Subsidiary shall be senior in right of payment to the guarantee of the Other Indebtedness (which guarantee of such Subordinated Indebtedness shall provide that such guarantee is subordinated to the Guarantees of such Subsidiary to the same extent and in the same manner as the Other Indebtedness is subordinated to the Loans and the Notes or the Guarantee of such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be). (b) If, subject to the requirements of Section 7.03, all or substantially all of the assets of any Guarantor or all of the Capital Stock of any Guarantor are sold (including by issuance or otherwise) by the Borrower in a transaction constituting an Asset Sale, and if (x) the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale are used in accordance with Sections 7.04 and 2.05(a)(iv)(B), or (y) the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent an officers' certificate to the effect that the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall be used in accordance with Sections 7.04 and 2.05(a)(iv)(B) and within the time limits specified by such Sections, then such Guarantor (in the event of the sale or other disposition of all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor), or the corporation acquiring such assets (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) shall be released and discharged of its Guarantee obligations in respect of the Loans and Notes. (c) Any Guarantor that is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.10 shall upon such Designation be released and discharged of its Guarantee obligations in respect of the Loans and Notes and any Unrestricted Subsidiary whose Designation is revoked pursuant to Section 7.10 will be required to become a Guarantor in accordance with Article III. (d) In addition, a Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be released upon the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or all of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor; provided that either (i) such sale or transfer complies with the provisions set forth in Section 7.04 or (ii) such sale or transfer need not comply with the provisions set forth in Section 7.04 because the assets or Capital Stock so sold or transferred does not constitute an "Asset Sale" by operation of the provisions of clause (y) of the last sentence of the definition of Asset Sale. SECTION 7.08. Limitation on Restricted Subsidiary Capital Stock. The Borrower will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower to issue any Capital Stock, except for: (i) Capital Stock issued to and held by the Borrower or a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary;
-90- (ii) Capital Stock issued by a Person prior to the time (A) such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, (B) such Person merges with or into a Restricted Subsidiary or (C) a Restricted Subsidiary merges with or into such Person, provided that such Capital Stock was not issued or incurred by such Person in anticipation of the type of transaction contemplated by subclause (A), (B) or (C); (iii) Capital Stock issued or sold by a Restricted Subsidiary where, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer constitute a Restricted Subsidiary; and (iv) Capital Stock issued to any minority owner of a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that immediately after giving effect to such issuance, (A) such Restricted Subsidiary remains a Restricted Subsidiary and (B) the Borrower has at least the same percentage of beneficial ownership in such Restricted Subsidiary as immediately prior to such issuance. SECTION 7.09. Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries. The Borrower will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower to: (i) pay dividends or make any other distribution on its Capital Stock; (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary; (iii) make any Investment in the Borrower or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (iv) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, except (a) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement; (b) any encumbrance or restriction, with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary that was not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower on the date of this Agreement, in existence at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower and, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;
-91- (c) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), or in this clause (c), provided that the terms and conditions of any such encumbrances or restrictions are not materially less favorable to the Lenders than those under or pursuant to the agreement evidencing the Indebtedness so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced (except that an encumbrance or restriction that is not more restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement shall in any event be permitted hereunder); and (d) any encumbrance or restriction created pursuant to an asset sale agreement, stock sale agreement or similar instrument pursuant to which an Asset Sale permitted under Section 7.04 is to be consummated, so long as such restriction or encumbrance shall be effective only for a period from the execution and delivery of such agreement or instrument through a termination date not later than 270 days after such execution and delivery. SECTION 7.10. Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries. (a) The Borrower may designate after the Effective Date any Subsidiary of the Borrower as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" under this Agreement (a "Designation") only if: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such Designation; (ii) at the time of and after giving effect to such Designation, the Borrower could Incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) under the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Section 7.01(a); and (iii) the Borrower would be permitted to make an Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) at the time of Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such Designation) pursuant to Section 7.05(a) in an amount (the "Designation Amount") equal to the amount of the Borrower's Investment in such Subsidiary on such date. (b) Neither the Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall at any time (x) provide credit support for, subject any of its property or assets (other than the Capital Stock of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) to the satisfaction of, or guarantee, any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Indebtedness) or (y) be directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary. For purposes of the foregoing, the Designation of a Subsidiary of the Borrower as an Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to include the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary.
-92- (c) The Borrower may revoke any Designation of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (a "Revocation") only if: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of and after giving effect to such Revocation; and (ii) all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately following such Revocation would, if Incurred at such time, have been permitted to be Incurred for all purposes of this Agreement. (d) All Designations and Revocations must be evidenced by resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Borrower, delivered to the Administrative Agent certifying compliance with the foregoing provisions. ARTICLE VIII EVENTS OF DEFAULT SECTION 8.01. Events of Default. If any of the following events ("Events of Default") shall occur: (a) a default in the payment of any interest on any Loan when it becomes due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days; (b) a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Loan at its maturity (upon Stated Maturity, acceleration, voluntary or mandatory repayment, required repurchase or otherwise); (c) (i) a default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the Borrower or any Guarantor under this Agreement (other than a default in the performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clause (a) or (b) or in clause (ii) of this clause (c)) or any other Loan Document and such default or breach shall continue for a period of 30 days after written notice has been given, by certified mail, to the Borrower by the Lenders holding at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Loans, specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; (ii) a default in the performance or breach of the provisions of Sections 6.09, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 7.03 or 2.05 or of the Fee Letter or the Administrative Agent Fee Letter or the Syndication Letter; (d) one or more defaults shall have occurred under any agreements, indentures or instruments under which the Borrower, any Guarantor or any Subsidiary then has outstanding Indebtedness in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate and, if not al-

-95- ARTICLE IX THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SECTION 9.01. The Administrative Agent. Each of the Lenders hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
-96- The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower (no such consultation being required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
-97- this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Without the authorization of the Required Lenders, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall send to the Borrower or the Trustee under the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures (as "Trustee" is defined therein) any notice of a Default or Event of Default hereunder if such notice would result in a payment block in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS SECTION 10.01. Notices. (a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows: (i) if to the Borrower or any Guarantor, to it at 300 WillowBrook Office Park, Fairport, New York 14450, Attention of Thomas Mullin, Esq. (Telecopy No. (585) 218-3603); (ii) if to the Administrative Agent, to JPMorgan Chase Bank, 270 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017, Attention of Martha Gurwit, (Telecopy No. (212) 270-5127); and (iii) if to a Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire. (b) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto (or, in the case of any such change by a Lender, by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent). All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. (c) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent or each Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and
-98- other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications. SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No Deemed Waivers; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Obligor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Amendments. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall; (i) increase any Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) extend the Initial Maturity Date or Final Maturity Date, (v) alter the manner in which payments or prepayments of principal, interest or other amounts hereunder shall be applied as among the Lenders, without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; or (vii) release any Guarantor from any of its guarantee obligations under Article III without the written consent of each Lender; and provided, further, that (x) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, (y) any modification or supplement of Article III
-99- shall require the consent of each Guarantor and (z) any Guarantor may be released from its guarantee obligations under Article III to the extent permitted by Section 7.07. SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with any syndication of the Commitments and Loans provided for herein or the Exchange Notes, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iii) and all costs, expenses, taxes, assessments and other charges incurred in connection with any filing, registration or recording contemplated by any document referred to therein. (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any Property owned or operated by either Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to either Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
-100- (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such. (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Obligor shall assert, and each Obligor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor. SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) Assignments Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) (unless in connection with a transaction expressly permitted under Section 7.03) no Obligor may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Obligor without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section 10.04. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Participants referred to in paragraph (e) below and the directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) Assignments by Lenders. (i) Assignments Generally. Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and Loan(s)) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment or Loan to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment or Loan immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.
-101- (ii) Certain Conditions to Assignments. Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund of such assigning Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment(s) or Loan(s), the amount of the Commitment(s) or Loan(s) of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless the Administrative Agent otherwise consents; (B) each partial assignment of any Commitment or Loan shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of its Commitment or Loan; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and (D) the assignee, if it shall not already be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (iii) Effectiveness of Assignments. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 10.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.10 and 10.03 hereof). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section 10.04. (c) Acceptance of Assignments by Administrative Agent. Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04 and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
-102- for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (d) Participations. Any Lender may, without the consent of Borrower or the Administrative Agent sell participations to one or more Lenders or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) or Loan(s) held by it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) hereof that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section 10.04, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.08, 2.09 and 2.10 hereof to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 hereof as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to subsection 2.05(g) hereof as though it were a Lender hereunder. (e) Limitations on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.08, 2.09 and 2.10 hereof than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the applicable Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.10 unless the applicable Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of such Borrower, to comply with subsection 2.10(e) as though it were a Lender. (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 10.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
-103- (g) No Assignments to the Borrower or Affiliates. Anything in this Section 10.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign or participate any interest in any Commitment or Loan held by it hereunder to either Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent of each Lender. SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any funds are extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.08, 2.09, 2.10, 3.03 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Termination. (a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent and/or the Initial Lenders (including, without limitation, the Fee Letter and the Administrative Agent Fee Letter) constitute the entire contract between and among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. (b) Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the termination of the Commitments without any Bridge Loans being made pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02. SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
-104- to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.08. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate thereof to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all the obligations of any Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any Loan Document held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. (a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its Property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Syndication Letter, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or the Syndication Letter shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Syndication Letter against any Obligor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (c) Waiver of Venue. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Syndication Letter in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
-105- (d) Service of Process. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01, except that process may not be served by telecopy. Nothing in this Agreement or the Syndication Letter will affect the right of any party to this Agreement or the Syndication Letter to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SYNDICATION LETTER OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. SECTION 10.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 10.12. Treatment of Certain Information; Disclosure.(a) (a) The Borrower acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to the Borrower or one or more of its Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such Lender and the Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, subject to applicable Federal or state securities laws, to share any information delivered to such Lender by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. (b) The Borrower hereby agrees that each Guarantor, each Lender, the Administrative Agent (and each of their respective, and their respective affiliates', employees, officers, directors, agents and advisors (collectively, "Agent/Lender Representatives") is, and has been from the commencement of discussions with respect to the facility established by this Agreement (the "Facility"), permitted to disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Facility, and all materials of any
-106- kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to such Lender, the Administrative Agent or such Guarantor related to such tax treatment and tax structure. In this regard, each of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors acknowledges and agrees that its disclosure of the tax treatment and tax structure of the Facility is not limited in any way by an express or implied understanding or agreement, oral or written (whether or not such understanding or agreement is legally binding). Furthermore, each of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors acknowledges and agrees that it does not know or have reason to know that its use or disclosure of information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Facility is limited in any other manner (such as where the Facility is claimed to be proprietary or exclusive) for the benefit of any other Person. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Lenders, the Administrative Agent nor the Guarantors may disclose to any Person any information that constitutes material non-public information regarding the Borrower or its securities for purposes of Regulation FD of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other federal or state securities laws (it being acknowledged and agreed that the provisions of this Section 10.12 with respect to such information are reasonably necessary to comply with Regulation FD and/or such other federal and state securities laws) (such information referred to collectively herein as the "Borrower Information"), except that each of the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may disclose Borrower Information (i) to its and its affiliates' Agent/Lender Representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Borrower Information and instructed to keep such Borrower Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority or the National Association of Insurance Commissions, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this paragraph, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or such contractual counterparties' professional advisors, (vii) to the extent such Borrower Information (A) is or becomes generally available to the public on a nonconfidential basis through no fault or action by any of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Guarantors, or (B) is or becomes available to such Lenders, the Administrative Agent or the Guarantors on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower and (viii) with the consent of the Borrower. SECTION 10.13. "Credit Agreement" Under Indentures. (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes one of the successive renewals, substitutions, refinancings or replacements of the Credit Agreement dated as of June 29, 1993 between the Borrower, the Subsidiaries of the Borrower identified on the signature pages
-107- thereof under the caption "Subsidiary Guarantors", the lenders named therein and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent, referred to in the definition of "Credit Agreement" in Section 101 of the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures and that, accordingly, this Agreement constitutes the "Credit Agreement" under and as defined in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indentures.

SECTION 10.14. Cleanup Period.
