EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ [LOGO] CONSTELLATION NEWS RELEASE CONTACTS: Investor Relations: Mark Maring - 585-218-3668 Media: Philippa Dworkin - 585-218-3733 Ginny Clark - 585-218-3669 CONSTELLATION REAFFIRMS THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR GUIDANCE FAIRPORT, N.Y., November 04, 2003 - Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ), a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol brands, today reaffirmed its guidance for diluted earnings per share both on a comparable basis and a reported (GAAP) basis for the third quarter ending November 30, 2003 and fiscal year ending February 29, 2004. The table below reflects management's current diluted earnings per share expectations both on a comparable basis and a reported basis, together with a reconciliation.
- 2 - The Company expects additional imported beer sales ahead of the recently announced Mexican price increase to benefit modestly earnings per share in its third quarter ending November 30, 2003. Notwithstanding the benefit to the third quarter from additional imported beer sales, the Company has maintained its EPS guidance which takes into account the potential impact on shipments caused by California retail strikes and fires. The impact of the beer price increase on the fourth quarter ending February 29, 2004 is expected to be neutral to EPS, with additional sales in the early part of the quarter, offset by initial re-balancing of inventories toward the end of the quarter. Finally, it is anticipated that the benefit to Constellation's full year EPS ending February 29, 2004 from additional imported beer sales ahead of the price increase will be offset by further re-balancing of inventories in the early part of fiscal year 2005. The Company will be informing its distributors on the timing and the amount of the price increase towards late November. Constellation Brands, Inc. is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol brands with a broad portfolio across the wine, spirits and imported beer categories. Well-known brands in Constellation's portfolio include: Corona Extra, Pacifico, St. Pauli Girl, Black Velvet, Fleischmann's, Mr. Boston, Estancia, Simi, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo, Alice White, Vendange, Almaden, Arbor Mist, Stowells and Blackthorn.

The Company's forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and, unless otherwise noted, do not take into account the impact of any future acquisition, merger or any other business combination, divestiture or financing that may be completed after the date of this release. Any projections of future results of operations, and in particular, (i) the Company's estimated
- 3 - diluted earnings per share on a comparable basis for the third quarter ending November 30, 2003 and fiscal year ending February 29, 2004, and (ii) the Company's estimated diluted earnings per share on a reported (GAAP) basis for the third quarter ending November 30, 2003 and fiscal year ending February 29, 2004, should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur.
