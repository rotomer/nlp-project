On December 22, 2004, Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Constellation"), and its United States subsidiaries (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries), together with certain of its subsidiaries organized in foreign jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Administrative Agent"), and certain other lenders (such other lenders, together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to as the "Lenders") entered into a new credit agreement (the "2004 Credit Agreement").
 
The 2004 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $2.9 billion, consisting of a $600.0 million tranche A term loan facility due in November 2010, a $1.8 billion tranche B term loan facility due in November 2011, and a $500.0 million revolving credit facility (including a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $50.0 million) which terminates on December 22, 2010. The required repayments of the tranche A term loan facility are $15.0 million in fiscal 2005, $60.0 million in fiscal 2006, $67.5 million in fiscal 2007, $97.5 million in fiscal 2008, $120.0 million in fiscal 2009, $127.5 million in fiscal 2010 and $112.5 million in fiscal 2011. The required annual repayments of the tranche B term loan facility, which is backend loaded, are $4.5 million in fiscal 2005, and $18.0 million in each of fiscal 2006-2010, $436.5 million in fiscal 2011 and $1.269 billion in fiscal 2012.
 
The rate of interest payable under the 2004 Credit Agreement is a function, at Constellation's option, of LIBOR plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon Constellation's debt ratio, as defined in the 2004 Credit Agreement, and with respect to LIBOR borrowings ranges between 1.0% and 1.75%. The initial LIBOR margin for the revolving credit facility and the tranche A term loan facility is 1.50%, while the initial LIBOR margin on the tranche B term loan facility is 1.75%.
 
The obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the United States subsidiaries of Constellation (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries) and by certain foreign subsidiaries of Constellation. The obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement are also secured by a pledge of (i) 100% of the ownership interests in most of Constellation's United States subsidiaries and (ii) 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of Constellation's foreign subsidiaries.
 
Under the 2004 Credit Agreement, Constellation makes certain representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders customarily found in credit agreements of this type. Constellation and its subsidiaries are also subject to customary lending covenants that are contained in the 2004 Credit Agreement, including those restricting additional liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), the sale of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, the disposition and acquisition of property and the making of certain investments, in each case subject to numerous baskets, exceptions and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to maximum total debt and senior debt coverage ratios and minimum fixed charges and interest coverage ratios.
 
The 2004 Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, any material representation or warranty made by Constellation proving to be incorrect in any material respect, defaults relating to or acceleration of other material indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting Constellation or its subsidiaries, a change in control of Constellation (as defined in the 2004 Credit Agreement), Constellation or its subsidiaries becoming subject to certain material judgments, claims or liabilities, or a material defect in the Lenders' lien against the collateral securing the obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement.
 
 
In the event of a default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders must, terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the 2004 Credit Agreement and declare all obligations under the 2004 Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of the Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of Constellation will become immediately due and payable.
 
Constellation used the proceeds of borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement to repay the outstanding obligations under its 2003 Credit Agreement (as defined below), to fund the cash merger consideration payable in connection with its acquisition of The Robert Mondavi Corporation, a California corporation ("Mondavi"), and to pay certain obligations of Mondavi, including indebtedness outstanding under its bank facility and unsecured notes. Constellation intends to use the remaining availability under the 2004 Credit Agreement to fund its working capital needs on an ongoing basis.
 
As of December 22, 2004, under the 2004 Credit Agreement Constellation had outstanding tranche A term loans of $600.0 million bearing an interest rate of 5.75%, outstanding tranche B term loans of $1.8 billion bearing an interest rate of 6.0%, no outstanding revolving loans, undrawn revolving letters of credit of $37.5 million, and $462.5 million in revolving loans available to be drawn.
 
Certain of the Lenders and agents under the 2004 Credit Agreement are lenders and agents under the 2003 Credit Agreement, and certain of such Lenders and agents, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for Constellation and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The above description of the 2004 Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the 2004 Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
In connection with the entry into the 2004 Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01, which Item is incorporated herein by reference, the prior Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 19, 2003 among Constellation, certain of its subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and administrative agent, and certain other lenders, which since had been amended (or amended and restated) in October 2003, February 2004 and August 2004 (the "2003 Credit Agreement"), was terminated on December 22, 2004. At the time of termination, the outstanding credit facilities under the 2003 Credit Agreement consisted of a $345.0 million tranche A term loan facility due in February 2008, a $500.0 million tranche B term loan facility due in November 2008 and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility (including an Australian Dollar revolving sub-facility of up to A$10.0 million and a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $40.0 million) which was to expire on February 29, 2008.
 
The required annual repayments of the tranche A term loan facility was $60.0 million in fiscal 2005 and increased by $20.0 million each year through fiscal 2008. With respect to the tranche B term loan, no amounts were required to be repaid in fiscal 2005, and the required annual repayments were $5.0 million in each of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 and increased to $125.3 million in fiscal 2008 and $364.7 in fiscal 2009. The rate of interest payable under the 2003 Credit Agreement was, at Constellation's option, a function of LIBOR plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus a margin. The margin was adjustable based upon Constellation's debt ratio, as defined in the 2003 Credit Agreement, and with respect to LIBOR borrowings ranged between 1.0% and 2.5%.
 
 
Except as described above, the terms and conditions of the 2003 Credit Agreement were generally comparable to those of the 2004 Credit Agreement. Constellation did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the 2003 Credit Agreement.
 
Certain of the lenders and agents under the 2003 Credit Agreement are lenders and agents under the 2004 Credit Agreement, and certain of the lenders and agents under the 2003 Credit Agreement, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for Constellation and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
 
The above description of the 2003 Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the 2003 Credit Agreement, which has been previously filed.
 
 
 
See Item 1.01 which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
On December 22, 2004, Constellation completed the acquisition of Mondavi pursuant to the terms of the previously reported (a) Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of November 3, 2004, among Constellation, Mondavi and RMD Acquisition Corp. ("Merger Sub"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation, and (b) Support Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2004, among Constellation and the signatories thereto including certain officers and directors of Mondavi.
 
Effective December 22, 2004, Merger Sub merged with and into Mondavi, with Mondavi surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation. Each outstanding share of Mondavi Class A Common Stock was converted into the right to receive $56.50 in cash. Each outstanding share of Mondavi Class B Common Stock was converted into the right to receive $65.82 in cash.
 
The aggregate consideration for the equity of Mondavi on a fully diluted basis was approximately $1.03 billion in cash. In addition, immediately prior to the consummation of the merger Mondavi had debt which was effectively assumed by Constellation as a result of the merger. The cash merger consideration was financed, and certain Mondavi debt, interest and make-whole obligations in the aggregate amount of approximately $361.9 million were repaid, with borrowings under the 2004 Credit Agreement as described in Item 1.01.
 
Mondavi is a leading producer and marketer of premium table wines. In connection with the production of its products, Mondavi owns, operates and has an interest in certain wineries and controls certain vineyards. Mondavi's well-known brands include Woodbridge, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and the Robert Mondavi Napa, District and Reserve wines.

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Lender, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the respective Issuing Lender or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Lender; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that:
provided
 
(i) an Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit;
 
(ii) an Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
 
(iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).
 
(i) . The Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
 
(j) . If the Issuing Lender for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply; that, in case of any LC Disbursement made under an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, the amount of interest due with respect thereto shall be payable in U.S. Dollars and shall accrue on the Dollar Equivalent thereof calculated using the Exchange Rates on the date such LC Disbursement was made. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of such Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (g) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

(b) such Indebtedness shall be an obligation of the Borrower only, and none of its Subsidiaries shall be contingently or otherwise obligated in respect thereof, unless subordinated to the obligations of such Subsidiary to pay principal of and interest on the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and all other amounts payable hereunder on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Lenders than the terms and conditions of the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures;

(f) at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness, and after giving effect thereto, the Borrower shall be in compliance with Section 7.10 (the determination of such ratios to be calculated under the assumption that such Indebtedness was issued, at the beginning of the respective period and that any other Indebtedness to be retired with the proceeds thereof was in fact retired on such date of issuance);
 
(g) at the time of such issuance, and after giving effect thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder; and
 
(h) prior to such issuance the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect specified in the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (e), (f) and (g) (and setting forth in reasonable detail the computations necessary to determine compliance with said clause (f)).

Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will consent to any modification, supplement or waiver of any of the provisions of any Senior Unsecured Indebtedness if such amendment, supplement or waiver could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on (x) the legal ability or financial capacity of any Obligor to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party or (y) the rights of or benefits available to the Lenders under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

(n) a Change in Control shall occur; or
 
(o) any Lien or Liens created by the Security Documents with respect to any material portion of the Collateral shall at any time not constitute valid and perfected Liens on such collateral intended to be covered thereby (to the extent perfection by filing, registration, recordation or possession is required herein or therein) in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, free and clear of all other Liens (other than Liens permitted under Section 7.02 or under the respective Security Documents), or, except for expiration or termination in accordance with its terms or otherwise permitted hereunder, any of the Security Documents with respect to any material portion of the Collateral shall for whatever reason be terminated or cease to be in full force and effect, or the enforceability thereof shall be contested by any Obligor;
 
then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to any Obligor described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Obligors accrued

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and as its trustee in respect of the Foreign Equity Pledge Agreements and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other
 
terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein or therein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for an Obligor), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and not to be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Without the authorization of the Required Lenders, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall send to the Borrower or the Trustee under the Senior Subordinated Note Indentures any notice of a Default or Event of Default hereunder if such notice would result in a payment block in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes.
 
The Administrative Agent in its capacity as trustee or otherwise under any Foreign Equity Pledge Agreement:
 
(a) shall not be liable for any failure, omission, or defect in perfecting the security constituted or created by such Foreign Equity Pledge Agreement including, without limitation, any failure to (i) register the same in accordance with the provisions of any of the documents of title of the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreement) to any of the assets thereby charged or (ii) effect or procure registration of or otherwise protect the security created by this deed under any registration laws in any jurisdiction;
 
(b) may accept without inquiry such title as the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreements) or the Mortgagor (as defined in each Australian Equity Pledge Agreement) may have to the Shares (as so respectively defined); and
 
(c) shall not be under any obligation to hold any title deed or any other documents in connection with any Foreign Equity Pledge Agreement or to take any steps to protect or preserve the same. The Administrative Agent may permit the Chargor (as defined in the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreements) or the Mortgagor (as defined in each Australian Equity Pledge Agreement) to retain all such title deeds and other documents in its possession.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Foreign Equity Pledge Agreements, all moneys which under the trusts therein contained are received by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as trustee or otherwise may be invested in the name of or under the control of the Administrative Agent in any investment for the time being authorized by English law (in the case of the U.K. Equity Pledge Agreements), Australian law (in the case of the Australian Equity Pledge Agreements), Luxembourg law (in the case of the Luxembourg Equity Pledge Agreement) or New Zealand Law (in the case of the New Zealand Equity Pledge Agreements), in each case for the investment by trustees of trust money or in any other investments which may be selected by the Administrative Agent. Additionally, the same may be placed on deposit in the name of or under the control of the Administrative Agent at such bank or institution (including JPMorgan Chase) and upon such terms as the Administrative Agent may think fit.

Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section 10.04, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 hereof to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 hereof as though it were a Lender; that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(d) hereof as though it were a Lender hereunder. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System that (a) has purchased a participation from CoBank in the minimum amount of U.S.$10,000,000 on or after the Effective Date, (b) is, by written notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent ("Voting Participant Notification"), designated by CoBank as being entitled to be accorded the rights of a voting participant hereunder (any bank that is a member of the Farm Credit System so designated being called a "Voting Participant") and (c) receives the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to become a Voting Participant, shall be entitled to vote (and the voting rights of CoBank shall be correspondingly reduced), on a dollar for dollar basis, as if such participant were a Lender, on any matter requiring or allowing a Lender to provide or withhold its consent, or to otherwise vote on any proposed action.

(f) . A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 hereof than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(e) as though it were a Lender.

and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Subject Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver or consent by such Subject Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation under this Section 10.04(i) cease to apply.

The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 3.03 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
