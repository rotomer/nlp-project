FAIRPORT, N.Y., April 7, 2005
We had a monumental year in which we continued to gain momentum and generate true growth, which is growth that produces incremental returns above our cost of capital, stated Richard Sands, Constellation Brands chairman and chief executive officer. Our worldwide team created true growth across our businesses by its adept management of our existing brands, introduction of new products and integration of the key acquisition of Robert Mondavi, as well as the addition of the Ruffino and Effen Vodka brands. Pursuing and capturing true growth is ingrained in our corporate culture and values.
Fiscal Year Results
Net sales, as reported under generally accepted accounting principles (reported), for fiscal 2005 totaled $4.09 billion, up 15 percent, driven by growth in the companys branded wine, U.K. wholesale and beer businesses, and from the Dec. 22, 2004, acquisition of The Robert Mondavi Corporation (Robert Mondavi). Currency contributed four percent of the increase. Both reported net income of $276.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.37 set records, and were up 25 percent and 15 percent, respectively, over the prior year.
Fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reported results include acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and net unusual costs which totaled $37.6 million after tax or $0.33 per share for fiscal 2005, and $46.1 million after tax or $0.43 per share for fiscal 2004. Excluding these items, net income and diluted earnings per share on a comparable basis increased 18 percent to $314.1 million and eight percent to $2.70, respectively, for fiscal 2005.
For the year, pro forma net sales on a comparable basis increased 13 percent including four percent from currency. The comparable pro forma net sales increase included $31 million of sales from Hardy Wine Company Limited (Hardy) for March 2003, as well as $43 million from Robert Mondavi for January and February 2004, and excluded $9.2 million of relief from certain excise tax, duty and other costs incurred in prior year periods, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
