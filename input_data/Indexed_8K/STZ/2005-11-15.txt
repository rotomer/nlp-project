Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On November 11, 2005 Constellation Brands, Inc. ("Constellation") posted on its website materials for presentation to investors, entitled "Constellation Brands Discussion of Vincor's Directors' Circular," a copy of which materials is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     Also on November 11, 2005, Canadian counsel to Constellation and its wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Bidder"), applied to the Ontario Securities Commission for an order that trading cease in respect of any securities issued or to be issued in connection with the shareholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan") of Vincor International Inc. ("Vincor"), adopted on September 28, 2005. As previously announced, Constellation, through the Bidder, commenced a cash takeover bid (the "Offer") on Thursday, October 20, 2005 for all of the outstanding common shares (and associated Poison Pill Rights) of Vincor for CDN $31.00 per share. The Offer is scheduled to expire at 5:00 pm Toronto time on Monday, November 28, 2005.
     Among the reasons stated in the application were that adoption of the Rights Plan is an improper defensive tactic that warrants a cease trade order as it was adopted as a tactical maneuver intended to frustrate the anticipated take-over bid by Constellation and that it was adopted without approval of the shareholders of Vincor. The application also stated that as matters presently stand, Constellation did not intend to extend the Offer in the face of the Rights Plan.
