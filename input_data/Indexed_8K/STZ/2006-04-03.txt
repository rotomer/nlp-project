Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 2, 2006, Constellation Brands, Inc. ("Constellation") and Constellation Canada Holdings Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation ("Constellation Canada"), entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the "Arrangement Agreement") with Vincor International Inc. ("Vincor") pursuant to which Vincor has agreed to submit to its shareholders a statutory plan of arrangement (the "Arrangement") under the pursuant to which Constellation Canada would acquire all outstanding common shares (other than those directly or indirectly owned by Constellation and its affiliates), and common shares that may become outstanding upon the exercise of options and other rights to purchase common shares, of Vincor for Cdn$36.50 per common share in cash, and would assume Vincor's outstanding debt on the terms set out in the Arrangement. Under the Arrangement Agreement, Vincor, Constellation and Constellation Canada will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arrangement to be successful. Based on the total number of common shares, and securities exchangeable for or convertible into common shares, outstanding on April 3, 2006 and assuming the exercise in full of all such exchangeable and convertible securities prior to the effective time of the Arrangement, the total consideration payable by Constellation Canada for the common shares of Vincor is expected to be approximately Cdn$1.27 billion (U.S. $1.09 billion). In addition, approximately Cdn$250 million (U.S. $220 million) of Vincor's net debt will be assumed. Constellation has received a commitment for an all-debt financing that would be sufficient to complete the Arrangement. Vincor has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to convene and hold a shareholders meeting to consider the Arrangement on June 1, 2006.
Canada Business Corporations Act
The Arrangement Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type. The representations and warranties contained in the Arrangement Agreement are made by the parties solely for the benefit of each other and should not be relied upon by any other person. The obligation of Constellation to consummate the Arrangement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including certain regulatory approvals having been obtained, the receipt of the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Vincor shareholders present in person or by proxy at the shareholders meeting to consider the Arrangement, the receipt of a court order approving the Arrangement, and shareholders representing in excess of 20% of Vincor's outstanding common shares not having exercised dissent or similar rights in connection with the Arrangement. Under the Arrangement Agreement, Vincor has agreed not to take certain steps in respect of negotiations with other parties, except in respect of certain unsolicited superior proposals.
The Arrangement Agreement contains termination rights for both Constellation and Vincor. Upon termination under certain specified conditions, Vincor will be required to pay Constellation a termination fee of Cdn$33.6 million.
The foregoing description of the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Arrangement Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.2
03
 
Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ) and Vincor International (TSX: VN) today announced that the two companies yesterday entered into an arrangement agreement under which Constellation will acquire Vincor, which is unanimously supported by both companies' Boards. The acquisition is to be completed by way of a statutory plan of arrangement in Canada under which Constellation will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vincor at a cash price of C$36.50. The transaction price represents a premium of 55.5 percent to Vincor's closing share price on Sept. 27, 2005, prior to Constellation's initial approach, and a premium of 15.9 percent to Vincor's closing share price on March 31, 2006.
FAIRPORT, N.Y., April 3, 2006 
"Discussions and diligence led the Constellation and Vincor management teams and boards of directors to the conclusion that this is a mutually beneficial transaction because it is a natural fit for both companies," stated Richard Sands, Constellation Brands chairman and chief executive officer. "Through this combination, Canada will become a core market for Constellation, while adding new and existing brands to our already formidable portfolio in other key markets. Our cultures, values and decentralized structures are similar, and we are confident that this is in the best interest of both companies' brands, shareholders, customers and employees. The combination of Vincor with Constellation will result in a world class, all-star team of people, vineyards, wineries and an unequalled international wine portfolio, in addition to long-term value creation."
"We are pleased that Constellation has offered a value that fully recognizes our strong brands, exceptional workforce and significant international growth opportunities," said Donald Triggs, president and chief executive officer, Vincor International Inc. "Through the dedication and hard work of all of our employees we have built one of the world's leading wine companies. This transaction marks the next chapter in the evolution of Vincor, providing strengthened international distribution for our leading brands and new opportunities for our employees. I would like to thank all of our shareholders and many supporters who have contributed to the creation of a truly great company and Canadian success story."
The transaction is valued at approximately C$1.52 (U.S. $1.31) billion, which includes approximately C$1.27 (U.S. $1.09) billion of equity, based on Vincor's approximately 34.8 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, and the assumption of approximately C$250 (U.S. $220) million of Vincor's net debt as of Dec. 31, 2005. The transaction will be modestly accretive to Constellation's fiscal 2007 comparable earnings per share. Constellation has received a commitment for an all-debt financing that would be sufficient to complete the transaction.
An information circular relating to the transaction is expected to be sent to Vincor shareholders in the latter half of April, with the shareholder vote scheduled for June 1, and closing of the transaction scheduled for the first week in June 2006, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.
Conference Call Information
