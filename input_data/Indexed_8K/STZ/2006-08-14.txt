Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 10, 2006, Constellation Brands, Inc. (the "Company") and certain subsidiary guarantors (the "Guarantors") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Scotia Capital (USA) Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Underwriters") for the sale by the Company of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes") for a public offering price of 99.02% of the principal amount of the Notes. The offering is being made by a prospectus dated August 8, 2006 included in the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-136379), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on August 8, 2006 (the "Registration Statement"), together with a prospectus supplement dated August 10, 2006 and filed with the SEC on August 11, 2006. The Underwriters will purchase the Notes from the Company at 98.02% of their principal amount.
The Notes will be issued under an Indenture as supplemented by Supplemental Indenture No. 1 to be entered into among the Company, the Guarantors and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee. The offering is scheduled to close on August 15, 2006, subject to customary closing conditions. A revised form of the Indenture and the form of Supplemental Indenture No. 1 are filed herewith for incorporation into the Registration Statement as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2.
The Underwriters and their affiliates have performed and may in the future perform various investment banking, commercial banking and advisory services for the Company from time to time for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders under the Company's Credit Agreement (dated as of June 5, 2006), borrowings under which will be reduced with the net proceeds of the offering. The aggregate amount of debt owed to the Underwriters and their affiliates that is being repaid with the proceeds from this offering constitutes less than 10% of the proceeds of the offering.
The Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
The description above is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Underwriting Agreement, filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
. (a) Each Issuer, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Issuers will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue

statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Issuer may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Issuer, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls any Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Issuers to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. Each Issuer acknowledges that the statements set forth in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
provided
however
 
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any statement as to or any admission of culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which any Issuer and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Issuers, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Issuers shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by any Issuer on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Issuers and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
provided
however
 
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls any Issuer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of any Issuer who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of any Issuer shall have the same rights to contribution as the Issuers, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). The Underwriters obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchangeshall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authoritiesor (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
Termination
 
11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Execution of Debt Securities; Authentication
No Debt Security of any series shall be entitled to the benefits hereof or shall be or become valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there shall appear on the Debt Security a certificate of authentication, substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed manually by the Trustee for such series or an Authenticating Agent; and such certificate on any series of Debt Securities issued by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that it has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any series of Debt Securities shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Debt Security to the Trustee or its designee for cancellation as provided in Section 2.11 together with a
 
written statement (which need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Debt Security has not been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Debt Security shall be deemed not to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
If the form or forms or terms of the Debt Securities of any series have been established in or pursuant to one or more resolutions of the Board of Directors or indentures supplemental hereto as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.2, in authenticating such Debt Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debt Securities, the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 11.2) shall be fully protected in relying upon, a copy of such resolution or resolutions delivered to the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent and certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company or the Guarantors to have been duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company or the boards of directors of the Guarantors, as applicable, and to be in full force and effect on the date of such certification, and an Opinion of Counsel stating:
(1) if the form or forms of such Debt Securities and Guarantees have been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or indenture supplemental hereto, that such form or forms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) if the terms of such Debt Securities and Guarantees have been established by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or indenture supplemental hereto, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(3) that such Debt Securities and Guarantees, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent and issued by the Company and the Guarantors in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equity principles (or such other similar matters as in the opinion of such counsel shall not materially adversely affect such enforceability); and
(4) that the issuance and authentication of such Debt Securities and Guarantees to be issued will not conflict with, result in a breach or constitute a default or with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would not constitute a default, under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the Guarantors or result in such a default or violation;
provided, however, that, with respect to Debt Securities of a series which are not to be issued at one time, the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to receive such Opinion of Counsel only once at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Debt Securities of such series and that the opinions described in clauses (2) and (3) above may state, respectively,
(a) that, when the terms of such Debt Securities and Guarantees shall have been established pursuant to a Company Order or pursuant to such procedures as may be specified from time to time by a Company Order, all as contemplated by and in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors or an Officers' Certificate pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors or indenture supplemental hereto, as the case may be, such terms will have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(b) that such Debt Securities and Guarantees, when (i) executed by the Company or the Guarantors, as the case may be, (ii) completed, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or Authenticating Agent in accordance with this Indenture, (iii) issued and delivered by the Company or the Guarantors, as the case may be, and (iv) paid for, all as contemplated by and in accordance with the aforesaid Company Order or specified procedures, as the case may be, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company or Guarantor, as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other laws or general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and to general equitable principles (or such other similar matters as in the opinion of such counsel shall not materially adversely affect such enforceability).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.7 and this Section, if all the Debt Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, the resolution of the Board of Directors or indenture supplemental hereto, the certified copy of the record of action taken pursuant to such resolution or supplemental indenture, the Officers' Certificate, the Company Order and any other documents otherwise required pursuant to such Sections need not be delivered at or prior to the time of authentication of each Debt Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Debt Security of such series to be issued; provided, however, that any subsequent request by the Company to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent to authenticate Debt Securities of such series shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Company that, as of the date of such request, the statements made in the Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 3.7 at or prior to authentication of the first such Debt Security shall be true and correct on the date thereof as if made on and as of the date thereof.
The Trustee or the Authenticating Agent shall not be required to authenticate such Debt Securities if the issue of such Debt Securities pursuant to this Indenture will adversely affect the Trustee's or the Authenticating Agent's own rights, duties or immunities under the Debt Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
With respect to Debt Securities of a series which are not all issued at one time, the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent may conclusively rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any such Debt Securities or the Guarantors of any such Guarantees, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel, Officers' Certificate and other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.7 and this Section, as applicable, at or prior to the time of the first authentication of Debt Securities of such series and Guarantees unless and until such opinion, certificate or other documents have been superseded or revoked in a writing delivered to the Trustee. In connection with the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities of a series which are not all issued at one time, the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to assume that the Company's instructions to authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities do not violate any rules, regulations or orders of any governmental agency or commission having jurisdiction over the Company.
SECTION 2.5 . The Trustee and the Authenticating Agent, forthwith upon the execution and delivery of this Indenture and from time to time thereafter, upon the execution and delivery to it of Debt Securities of any series by the Company and the Guarantees by the Guarantors as herein provided, and without any further action on the part of the Company and the Guarantors, shall authenticate such Debt Securities up to a maximum amount, if any, designated for such series pursuant to Section 2.2 and deliver them to or upon the receipt of a Company Order; provided, however, that if not all the Debt Securities of a series are to be issued at one time and if the resolution of the Board of Directors or indenture supplemental hereto establishing such series as contemplated by Sections 2.1 and 2.2 shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Debt Securities and for determining the form or forms or terms of particular Debt Securities of such series including, but not limited to, interest rate, if any, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue.

Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12, payment of or on account of the principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be made only to or upon the order in writing of such registered owner thereof, but such registration may be changed as above provided.

Persons deemed owners of Debt Securities
SECTION 2.8 .

Until exchanged for Debt Securities of the same series in definitive form such Debt Securities in temporary form shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

The Company may require payment of the expenses which may be incurred by the Company or any agent thereof and the charges and expenses of the Trustee and the Authenticating Agent in the premises. Any series of Debt Securities issued under the provisions, of this Section 2.9 in lieu of any series of Debt Securities alleged to have been destroyed, lost or stolen, shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company and the Guarantors, whether or not the Debt Security alleged to have been destroyed, lost or stolen shall be found at any time, and shall be equally and proportionately entitled to the benefits of this Indenture with all other Debt Securities of the same series issued under this Indenture.

Every exchange of Debt Securities of any series shall be effected in such manner as may be prescribed by the Company with the approval of the Trustee and registrar, and as may be necessary to comply with the regulations of any stock exchange upon which Debt Securities of such series are listed or are to be listed or to conform to usage in respect thereof.
Exchanges of Debt Securities
Upon every exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities, no service charge shall be made but the Company may require the payment of any taxes or other governmental charges required to be paid with respect to such exchange or registration, as a condition precedent to the exercise of the privilege of such exchange or registration.
All Debt Securities executed, authenticated and delivered in exchange or upon registration of transfer shall be the valid obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, evidencing the same debt as the Debt Securities surrendered, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture to the same extent as the Debt Securities in exchange for which they were authenticated and delivered.

If the Company shall acquire any of the Debt Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Debt Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee or its designee for cancellation. Unless otherwise directed in writing by the Company, the Trustee or its designee shall destroy all cancelled Debt Securities and furnish to the Company a certificate evidencing such destruction.
SECTION 2.12 .

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Debt Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Debt Securities of such series, deposit with the Paying Agent or Agents for the Debt Securities of such series a sum, by 10:00 a.m. New York time in immediately available funds on the payment date, sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any failure so to act.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company order direct any Paying Agent for such series to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such payment.

On or before 10:00 a.m. New York time of the date fixed for redemption, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or the Paying Agent money in immediately available funds on such redemption date (or other form of payment if permitted by the terms of such Debt Securities) in an amount sufficient to redeem on the date fixed for redemption all the Debt Securities of such series or portions thereof to be redeemed, other than any Debt Securities of such series called for redemption on such date which have been converted prior to the date of such deposit, at the appropriate redemption price, together with any accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If less than all the Debt Securities then Outstanding of such series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, substantially pro rata or by lot, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, in its sole discretion, the numbers of the Debt Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part, and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Debt Securities to be redeemed; provided, however, that Debt Securities of such series registered in the name of the Company shall be excluded from any such selection for redemption until all Debt Securities of such series not so registered shall have been previously selected for redemption. For the purpose of such selection in case of redemption of less than all of the Debt Securities of any series, the Trustee and the Company shall have the option to treat as Outstanding Debt Securities any Debt Securities of such series which are surrendered for conversion after the fifteenth day immediately preceding the mailing of the notice of such redemption, and need not treat as Outstanding Debt Securities any Debt Securities authenticated and delivered during such period in exchange for the unconverted portion of any Debt Securities converted in part during such period.

Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Debt Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Debt Securities called for redemption.
Upon or after the receipt of such notice, the Trustee, in the name of the Company and as its agent, shall mail by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each registered holder of a Debt Security to be redeemed in whole or in part at his last address appearing on the registration books of the Company, a notice of redemption.

Such notice shall be mailed not later than the tenth, and not earlier than the sixtieth, day before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice; and failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holder of any series of Debt Securities designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Security.
 
The Company shall pay to the Trustee the cost of mailing notices of redemption and any other necessary expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection therewith.
SECTION 5.3 . The notice of election to redeem having been mailed as hereinbefore provided, the Debt Securities or portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable on the redemption date at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, at the place or places specified in such notice, and if cash (or other form of payment if permitted by the terms of such Debt Securities) in the amount necessary to redeem such Debt Securities or portions thereof has been deposited with the Trustee, interest on such Debt Securities or portions thereof shall cease to accrue from and after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price, plus accrued interest, if any) and the right to convert such Debt Securities or portions thereof, if the terms of such Debt Securities provide for conversion pursuant to Section 2.2, shall terminate at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption or such other day as may be specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for Debt Securities of such series. The respective registered holders of Debt Securities or portions thereof so called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on or after the date fixed for redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the redemption price, plus accrued interest, if any), upon presentation and surrender at the place or places of payment specified in such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 13.4, if the record date for payment of interest is on or prior to the redemption date, such interest shall be payable to the persons who are holders of such Debt Securities on such record date according to the terms of such Debt Securities and Section 2.12.

Such Debt Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Debt Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. Upon any such election the Company shall receive credit against such sinking fund payments required to be made in the order in which they are to be made. Any series of Debt Securities for which credit is elected to be taken which shall not theretofore have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall at the time of such election be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation by the Trustee.

At least 45 days (or such lesser number of days as the Trustee shall approve) prior to the date on which a sinking fund payment with respect to the Debt Securities of any series is due, the Company shall give written notice to the Trustee of the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series registered in the name of the Company (which shall be excluded from such redemption) and the Trustee shall select, substantially pro rata or by lot, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series to be redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Debt Securities of such series after allowance for any credit elected under Section 5.4 and shall, in the name and at the expense of the Company and as its agent, give notice of such redemption, all in the manner provided for in Section 5.2, except that such notice shall state that the Debt Securities of such series are being redeemed for the sinking fund. The notice of redemption having been mailed as hereinbefore provided, the Debt Securities or portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable on the next succeeding date for redemption specified in the Debt Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price thereof, all in the manner and with the effect provided for in Section 5.3.
Any sinking fund payment not so required to be applied to the redemption of Debt Securities of any series on the date for redemption specified in the Debt Securities of such series next succeeding any sinking fund payment date may, at the direction of the Company as evidenced by a Company Order, be applied by the Trustee prior to the forty-fifth day preceding the next following sinking fund payment date for such series, in such manner and from time to time, in such amount as the Company may direct the Trustee in writing, so far as such moneys shall be adequate, to the purchase for the sinking fund of Debt Securities of such series or portions thereof, in the open market, from the Company or otherwise, at prices (exclusive of accrued interest and brokerage commissions) not in excess of the sinking fund redemption price for such series. The Company agrees to pay to the Trustee, upon request, accrued interest and brokerage commissions paid by the Trustee with respect to any Debt Securities of such series so purchased by the Trustee and such accrued interest and brokerage commissions shall not be charged against the sinking fund for such series.

SECTION 5.7 .

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article V, the obligation of the Company and the Guarantors to pay the redemption price of such Debt Securities, including all accrued interest, if any, shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers. If such an agreement is entered into, any Debt Securities not duly surrendered for conversion by the holders thereof may, at the option of the Company, be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, acquired by such purchasers from such holders and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article XIII) surrendered by such purchasers for conversion, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the last day on which Debt Securities of such series called for redemption may be converted in accordance with this Indenture and the terms of such Debt Securities, subject to payment of the above amount aforesaid. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall hold and pay to the holders of Debt Securities whose Debt Securities are selected for redemption any such amount paid to it in the same manner as it would moneys deposited with it by the Company for the redemption of Debt Securities.

This provision, however, is subject to the condition that if, at any time after the principal of (and/or such other specified amount on) the Debt Securities of such series shall so become due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter

SECTION 7.2 . In case the Company or any Guarantor shall commit an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of any series described in Section 7.1(a) or (b) or any Guarantee, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company and the Guarantors shall pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Debt Securities then Outstanding of such series, the whole amount which then shall have become due on all such Debt Securities of such series for principal, premium, if any, and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate specified in the Debt Securities of such series (or, if no such rate is specified, at the rate borne by the Debt Securities of such series), and in addition thereto, such additional amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, liabilities, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, any predecessor Trustee, their agents and counsel.

In case the Company or the Guarantors shall fail to pay the same forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute any judicial proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid and may prosecute such

The Trustee, the Debt Security registrar, any paying agent or any other agent of the Company in its individual or any other capacity may buy, own, hold and sell any of the Debt Securities or any other evidences of indebtedness or other securities, whether heretofore or hereafter created or issued, of the Company or any subsidiary or Affiliate with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Debt Security registrar, paying agent or such other agent; and subject to the provisions of this Article XI, the Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Company or any subsidiary or Affiliate, including, without limitation, secured and unsecured loans to the Company or any subsidiary or Affiliate; and may maintain any and all other general banking and business relations with the Company and any subsidiary or Affiliate with like effect and in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Trustee were not a party to this Indenture; and no implied covenant shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee in respect of any such matters.
Trustee may hold Debt Securities and otherwise deal with Company
SECTION 11.13 . The Trustee may comply in good faith with any rule, regulation or order of the
Trustee may comply with any rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission
 
Securities and Exchange Commission made pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall be fully protected in so doing notwithstanding that such rule, regulation or order may thereafter be amended or rescinded or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason, but nothing herein contained shall require the Trustee to take any action or omit to take any action in accordance with such rule, regulation or order, except as is in this Indenture otherwise required.
SECTION 11.14 . The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Debt Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Debt Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption or partial conversion thereof, and if the Trustee is required to appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with respect to any series of Debt Securities, to authenticate Debt Securities of such series and to take such other actions as are specified in Sections 2.4, 2.8, 2.11, 5.2 and 13.3, and Debt Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent (except in respect of original issue and Section 2.9). Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $1,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 11.14, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.14, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section 11.14.
Appointment of Authenticating Agent
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of such Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section 11.14, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice or resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.14, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall provide notice to the holders of the Debt Securities of the series as to which the Authenticating Agent will serve as provided in Section 3.8. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 11.14.
 
The Trustee agrees to pay each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 11.2.
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section 11.14, the Debt Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
If all of the Debt Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one time, and if the Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Debt Securities upon original issuance located where the Company wishes to have Debt Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not comply with Section 3.7 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel), shall appoint in accordance with this Section 11.14 an Authenticating Agent having an office in a place designated by the Company with respect to such series of Debt Securities.
SECTION 12.1 . Without the consent of any of the holders of Debt Securities, the Company, when authorized by resolution of its Board of Directors, and, upon receipt of an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, is duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, the Trustee from time to time and at any time, subject to the conditions and restrictions in this Indenture contained, may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, which thereafter shall form a part hereof, for any one or more of the following purposes:
Company and Trustee may enter into supplemental indenture for special purposes
(a) to add to the covenants and agreements of the Company and the Guarantors in this Indenture contained, other covenants and agreements thereafter to be observed for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of Debt Securities (and if such covenants and agreements are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Debt Securities, stating that such covenants and agreements are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein reserved to or conferred upon the Company or the Guarantors; or
 
(b) to cure any ambiguity or to cure, correct or supplement any defect or inconsistent provision contained in this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture; or
(c) to make such provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture which may be necessary or desirable, or otherwise change this Indenture in any manner which shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Debt Securities of any series; or
(d) to evidence the succession of another corporation to the Company, or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor corporation of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Company pursuant to Article X and to provide for the adjustment of conversion rights pursuant to Section 13.7; or
(e) to establish the form or terms of the Debt Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.2; or
(f) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, provided that, except as otherwise contemplated by Section 2.2(11), any such change or elimination shall become effective only when there is no Debt Security outstanding of any series created prior thereto which is entitled to the benefit of such provision; or
(g) to add or change any of the provisions of this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the issuance of Debt Securities in bearer form, registrable or not registrable as to principal, and with or without interest coupons, or to provide for uncertificated Debt Securities in addition to certificated Debt Securities (so long as any "registration-required obligation" within the meaning of Section 163(f)(2) of the Code is in registered form for purposes of the Code); or
(h) to amend or supplement any provision contained herein, which was required to be contained herein in order for this Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, if the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 or regulations thereunder change what is so required to be included in qualified indentures, in any manner not inconsistent with what then may be required for such qualification; or
(i) to add any additional Events of Default (and if such Events of Default are to be applicable to less than all series of Debt Securities, stating that such Events of Default are expressly being included solely to be applicable to such series); or
(j) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Debt Securities of one or more series any property or assets; or
(k) to add a Guarantor or to release a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; or
(l) to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as contemplated in Section 11.7(b);
and the Company hereby covenants that it will fully perform all the requirements of any such supplemental indenture which may be in effect from time to time. Nothing in this Article XII contained shall affect or limit the right or obligation of the Company to execute and deliver to the Trustee any instrument of further assurance or other instrument which elsewhere in this Indenture it is provided shall be delivered to the Trustee.
 
The Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which adversely affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section 12.1 may be executed by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of any of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 12.2.
SECTION 12.2 . With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.1) of the holders of more than 50% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each series affected by such supplement, the Company and the Guarantors, when authorized by a resolution of each of their respective Board of Directors, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provision to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of such series of the Debt Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the time or times of payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or the interest on, any series of Debt Securities, or reduce the principal amount of, premium, if any, or the rate of interest on, any series of Debt Securities (and/or such other amount or amounts as any Debt Securities or supplemental indentures with respect thereto may provide to be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 7.1) or change the currency of payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any series of Debt Securities or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof or alter or impair the right to convert the same at the rate and upon the terms provided in the Indenture or alter or impair the right to require redemption at the option of the holder, without the consent of the holder of each Debt Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the percentage of Debt Securities of any series, the vote or consent of the holders of which is required for such modifications and alterations, without the consent of the holders of all Debt Securities then Outstanding of such series under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent of the holders of Debt Securities shall be necessary to permit the execution of supplemental indentures pursuant to Section 13.7.
Modification of Indenture with consent of holders of Debt Securities
Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of a resolution of its Board of Directors certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of holders of Debt Securities as aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors, as the case may be, in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may, in its discretion, but shall not be obligated, to enter into such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the holders of Debt Securities under this Section 12.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but is shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Debt Securities, or which modifies the rights of the holders of Debt Securities of such series with respect to such provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the holders of Debt Securities of any other series.
SECTION 12.3 . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article XII, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be
Effect of supplemental indentures
 
modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company, the Guarantors and the holders of Debt Securities shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 11.1, shall be provided with an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such supplemental indenture complies with the provisions of this Article XII.
SECTION 12.4 . Any supplemental indenture executed and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Article XII shall conform in all respects to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as then in effect.
Supplemental indentures to conform to Trust Indenture Act
SECTION 12.5 . If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Debt Security of any series, the Trustee may require the holder of the Debt Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Debt Security about the changed terms and return it to the holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Debt Security of any series shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Debt Security of such series that reflects the changed terms.
Notation on or exchange of Debt Securities
SECTION 13.1 . Debt Securities of any series which are convertible into Capital Stock at the option of the holder of Debt Securities shall be convertible in accordance with their terms and (unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for Debt Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article. Each reference in this Article XIII to "" or "" refers to the Debt Securities of the particular series that is convertible into Capital Stock. Each reference in this Article to "" into which Debt Securities of any series are convertible refers to the class of Capital Stock into which the Debt Securities of such series are convertible in accordance with their terms (as specified as contemplated by Section 2.2). If more than one series of Debt Securities with conversion privileges are outstanding at any time, the provisions of this Article XIII shall be applied separately to each such series.
Applicability of Article

Capital Stock
SECTION 13.2 . Subject to and upon compliance with the terms of the Debt Securities and the provisions of Section 5.7 and this Article XIII, at the option of the holder thereof, any series of Debt Securities of any series of any authorized denomination, or any portion of the principal amount thereof which is $1,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000, may, at any time during the period specified in the Debt Securities of such series, or in case such Debt Security or portion thereof shall have been called for redemption, then in respect of such Debt Security or portion thereof until and including, but not after (unless the Company shall default in payment due upon the redemption thereof) the close of business on the date fixed for redemption except that in the case of redemption at the option of the holder of Debt Securities, if specified in the terms of such Debt Securities, such right shall terminate upon receipt of written notice of the exercise of such option, be converted into duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the class of Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock, or combination thereof, as specified in such Debt Security, at the conversion rate for each $1,000 principal amount of Debt Securities (such initial conversion rate reflecting an initial conversion price specified in such Debt Security) in effect on the conversion date, or,
Right of holders of Debt Securities to convert Debt Securities
 
in case an adjustment in the conversion rate has taken place pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.5, then at the applicable conversion rate as so adjusted, upon surrender of the Debt Security or Debt Securities, the principal amount of which is so to be converted, to the Company at any time during usual business hours at the office or agency to be maintained by it in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2, accompanied by a written notice of election to convert as provided in Section 13.3 and, if so required by the Company and the Trustee, by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by the registered holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing. All Debt Securities surrendered for conversion shall, if surrendered to the Company or any conversion agent, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and cancelled by it, or shall, if surrendered to the Trustee, be cancelled by it, as provided in Section 2.11.
The initial conversion price or conversion rate in respect of a series of Debt Securities shall be as specified in the Debt Securities of such series. The conversion price or conversion rate will be subject to adjustment on the terms set forth in Section 13.5 or such other or different terms, if any, as may be specified by Section 2.2 for Debt Securities of such series. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Debt Security also apply to conversion of a portion of it.
SECTION 13.3 . As promptly as practicable after the surrender, as herein provided, of any series of Debt Securities or Debt Securities for conversion, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered at its said office or agency to or upon the written order of the holder of the Debt Security or Debt Securities so surrendered a certificate or certificates representing the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Capital Stock into which such Debt Security or Debt Securities may be converted in accordance with the terms thereof and the provisions of this Article XIII. Prior to delivery of such certificate or certificates, the Company shall require a written notice at its said office or agency from the holder of the Debt Security or Debt Securities so surrendered stating that the holder irrevocably elects to convert such Debt Security or Debt Securities, or, if less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, stating the portion thereof to be converted. Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address and social security or other taxpayer identification number) in which said certificate or certificates are to be issued. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made at the time that such Debt Security or Debt Securities shall have been surrendered for conversion and such notice shall have been received by the Company or the Trustee, the rights of the holder of such Debt Security or Debt Securities as a holder of Debt Securities shall cease at such time, the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Capital Stock upon conversion of such Debt Security or Debt Securities shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or holders of such shares of Capital Stock at such time and such conversion shall be at the conversion rate in effect at such time. In the case of any series of Debt Securities of any series which is converted in part only, upon such conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the holder thereof, as requested by such holder, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of such series of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of such Debt Security.
Issuance of shares of Capital Stock on conversion
If the last day on which a Debt Security may be converted is not a Business Day in a place where a conversion agent is located, the Debt Security may be surrendered to that conversion agent on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.
The Company will not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Capital Stock upon conversion while its stock transfer books are closed for a meeting of stockholders or for the payment of dividends or for any other purpose, but certificates for shares of Capital Stock shall be delivered as soon as the stock transfer books shall again be opened.
 
SECTION 13.4 . Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for Debt Securities of such series, Debt Securities surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any regular record date (or special record date for payment of defaulted interest) next preceding any interest payment date to the opening of business on such interest payment date (except Debt Securities called for redemption on a redemption date within such period) when surrendered for conversion must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest thereon which the registered holder is to receive on such interest payment date. Payment of interest shall be made, as of such interest payment date or such date, as the case may be, to the holder of record of the Debt Securities as of such regular, or special record date, as applicable. Except where Debt Securities surrendered for conversion must be accompanied by payment as described above, no interest on converted Debt Securities will be payable by the Company on any interest payment date subsequent to the date of conversion. No other payment or adjustment for interest or dividends is to be made upon conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon conversion of any series of Debt Securities with original issue discount, the fixed number of shares of Capital Stock into which such Debt Security is convertible delivered by the Company to the holder thereof shall be applied, first, to pay the accrued original issue discount attributable to the period from the date of issuance to the date of conversion of such Debt Security, and, second, to pay the balance of the principal amount of such Debt Security.
No payment or adjustment for interest or dividends
SECTION 13.5 . Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.2 for Debt Securities of such series, the conversion rate for Debt Securities in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment as follows:
Adjustment of conversion rate
(a) In case the Company shall (i) declare a dividend or make a distribution on the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible in shares of its Capital Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares of the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible into a greater number of shares, (iii) combine the outstanding shares of the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issue by reclassification of the shares of the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) any shares, the conversion rate for the Debt Securities of such series in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any series of Debt Securities of such series surrendered for conversion after such time shall be entitled to receive the number and kind of shares which he would have owned or have been entitled to receive had such Debt Security been converted immediately prior to such time. Similar adjustments shall be made whenever any event listed above shall occur.
(b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights or warrants to all holders of the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase shares of such class of Capital Stock (or securities convertible into shares of such class of Capital Stock) at a price per share (or, in the case of a right or warrant to purchase securities convertible into such class of Capital Stock, having a conversion price per share, after adding thereto the exercise price, computed on the basis of the maximum number of shares of such class of Capital Stock issuable upon conversion of such convertible securities, per share of such class of Capital Stock, so issuable) less than the current market price per share of such class of Capital Stock (as defined in subsection (d) below) on the date on which such issuance was declared or otherwise announced by the Company (the "Determination Date"), the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock into which each $1,000 principal amount of Debt Securities shall be convertible after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the
 
number of shares of such class of Capital Stock into which such principal amount of Debt Securities was convertible immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock outstanding on the Determination Date plus the number of additional shares of such class of Capital Stock offered for subscription or purchase (or in the case of a right or warrant to purchase securities convertible into such class of Capital Stock, the aggregate number of additional shares of such class of Capital Stock into which the convertible securities so offered are initially convertible), and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock outstanding on the Determination Date plus the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock obtained by dividing the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered (or, in the case of a right or warrant to purchase securities convertible into such class of Capital Stock, the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so offered, after adding thereto the aggregate exercise price of such rights or warrants computed on the basis of the maximum number of shares of such class of Capital Stock issuable upon conversion of such convertible securities) by such current market price. Shares of such class of Capital Stock of the Company owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and to the extent that shares of such class of Capital Stock are not delivered (or securities convertible into shares of such class of Capital Stock are not delivered) after the expiration of such rights or warrants (or, in the case of rights or warrants to purchase securities convertible into such class of Capital Stock once exercised, the expiration of the conversion right of such securities) the conversion rate shall be readjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants (or securities convertible into shares) been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares actually delivered. In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding any cash dividends paid from retained earnings and dividends payable in Capital Stock for which adjustment is made pursuant to subsection (a) above) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding subscription rights or warrants to purchase the class of Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible), the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock into which each $1,000 principal amount of Debt Securities of such series shall be convertible after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of such class of Capital Stock into which such principal amount of Debt Securities was convertible immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the fair market value of the assets of the Company, after deducting therefrom all liabilities of the Company and all preferences (including accrued but unpaid dividends) in respect of classes of Capital Stock having a preference with respect to the assets of the Company over such class of Capital Stock (all as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a certificate signed by any Chairmen of the Board, President or any Vice President (regardless of Vice Presidential designation) and the Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer of the Company, filed with the Trustee and each conversion agent) on such record date, and of which the denominator shall be such fair market value after deducting therefrom such liabilities and preferences, less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a statement filed with the Trustee and each conversion agent) of the assets or evidences of indebtedness, so distributed or of such
 
subscription rights or warrants applicable, so distributed. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the conversion rate shall again be adjusted to the conversion rate which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
(d) For the purpose of any computation under subsection (b) above and Section 13.6, the current market price per share of the Capital Stock on any date as of which such price is to be computed shall mean the average of the Closing Prices for the 30 consecutive Business Days commencing 45 Business Days before such date.
(e) No adjustment in the conversion rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require a cumulative increase or decrease of at least 1% in such rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided, further, that adjustments shall be required and made in accordance with the provisions of this Article XIII (other than this subsection (e)) not later than such time as may be required in order to preserve the tax-free nature of a distribution for United States income tax purposes to the holders of Debt Securities or the class of Capital Stock into which such Debt Securities are convertible. All calculations under this Article XIII shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-thousandth of a share, as the case may be. Anything in this Section 13.5 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such adjustments in the conversion rate, in addition to those required by this Section 13.5, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any stock dividend, subdivision of shares, distribution of rights to purchase stock or securities, or distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for stock hereafter made by the Company to its stockholders shall not be taxable for United States income tax purposes.
(f) Whenever the conversion rate is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and with the office or agency maintained by the Company for the conversion of Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 4.2, a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants of recognized national standing selected by the Board of Directors (who may be the regular accountants employed by the Company) setting forth the conversion rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and a computation thereof. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate or any facts or computations set forth therein, except to exhibit said certificate from time to time to any holder of Debt Securities of such series desiring to inspect the same. The Company shall promptly cause a notice setting forth the adjusted conversion rate to be mailed to the holders of Debt Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear upon the registration books of the Company.
(g) In the event that at any time, as a result of shares of any other class of Capital Stock becoming issuable in exchange or substitution for or in lieu of shares of the class of Capital Stock into which such Debt Securities are convertible or as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to subsection (a) above, the holder of any series of Debt Securities of such series thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of the Company other than shares of the class of Capital Stock into which the Debt Securities of such series are convertible, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any series of Debt Securities shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the class of Capital Stock into which the Debt Securities of such series are convertible contained in subsections (a) to
 
(f), inclusive, above, and the provisions of this Article XIII with respect to the class of Capital Stock into which the Debt Securities of such series are convertible shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
(h) The conversion rate with respect to any Debt Securities with original issue discount, the terms of which provide for convertibility, shall not be adjusted during the term of such Original Issue Discount Securities for accrued original issue discount.
(i) In the event that the Debt Securities of any series are convertible into more than one class of Capital Stock, the provisions of this Section 13.5 shall apply separately to events affecting each such class.
SECTION 13.6 . No fractional shares of Capital Stock shall be issued upon conversions of Debt Securities. If more than one Debt Security of any series shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities of such series (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. Instead of a fraction of a share of Capital Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any series of Debt Securities or Debt Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction of a share in an amount equal to the same fractional interest of the current market price (as defined in Section 13.5) per share of Capital Stock on the Business Day next preceding the day of conversion.
No fractional shares to be issued
SECTION 13.7 . In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the Company into, any other corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the corporation formed by such consolidation or the corporation into which the Company shall have been merged or the corporation which shall have acquired such assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee, a supplemental indenture, subject to the provisions of Article X and XII as they relate to supplemental indentures, providing that the holder of each Debt Security then Outstanding of a series which was convertible into Capital Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such Debt Security into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property, including amount of shares of stock and other securities and property, including cash, receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock of the Company into which such Debt Securities might have been converted immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental indenture shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as then in effect and shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article XIII. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provision contained in any such supplemental indenture relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or other securities or property receivable by holders of Debt Securities upon the conversion of their Debt Securities after any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and, subject to the provisions of Section 11.1, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel with respect thereto. If in the case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, the stock or other securities and property receivable by a holder of the Debt Securities includes stock or other securities and property of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Debt Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary. The above provisions of this Section 13.7 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.
Preservation of conversion rights upon consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance
 
SECTION 13.8 . With respect to the Debt Securities of any series, in case:

The failure to give the notice required by this Section 13.8 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution, right, warrant, subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or other action, or the vote upon any of the foregoing. Such notice shall also be published by and at the expense of the Company not later than the aforesaid filing date at least once in an Authorized Newspaper.
SECTION 13.9 . The Company covenants that at all times it will reserve and keep available out of each class of its authorized Capital Stock, free from preemptive rights, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of Debt Securities of any series as herein provided, such number of shares of Capital Stock of such class as shall then be issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Debt Securities of such series. The Company covenants that all shares of Capital Stock which shall be so issuable shall, when issued or delivered, be duly and validly issued shares of the class of authorized Capital Stock into which Debt Securities of such series are convertible, and shall be fully paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to preemptive rights and that, upon conversion, the appropriate capital stock accounts of the Company will be duly credited.
Covenant to reserve shares for issuance on conversion of Debt Securities
 
SECTION 13.10 . The Company covenants that if any shares of Capital Stock required to be reserved for purposes of conversion of Debt Securities hereunder require registration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority under any Federal or State law, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act, or any national or regional securities exchange on which such Capital Stock is listed at the time of delivery of any shares of such Capital Stock, before such shares may be issued upon conversion, the Company will use its best efforts to cause such shares to be duly registered, listed or approved, as the case may be.
Compliance with governmental requirements
SECTION 13.11 . The issuance of certificates for shares of Capital Stock upon the conversion of Debt Securities shall be made without charge to the converting holders of Debt Securities for any tax (including, without limitation, all documentary and stamp taxes) in respect of the issuance and delivery of such certificates, and such certificates shall be issued in the respective names of, or in such names as may be directed by, the holders of the Debt Securities converted; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the Debt Security converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Payment of taxes upon certificates for shares issued upon conversion
SECTION 13.12 . The Trustee and any conversion agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any holder of Debt Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the conversion rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be accountable with respect to the registration under securities laws, listing, validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Capital Stock, or of any other securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any series of Debt Securities; and neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent makes any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of stock or stock certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any series of Debt Securities for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 11.1, and any conversion agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article XIII.
Trustee's duties with respect to conversion provisions
SECTION 14.1 . If any of the Guarantors guarantee any series of Debt Securities, such series of Debt Securities shall be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor. Subject to the provisions of this Article XIV and the terms of a Debt Security of any series, each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, to each holder of Debt Securities and the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of Debt Securities, (a) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium if any, and interest on each Debt Security, when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, acceleration, or otherwise, the due and punctual payment of interest on the overdue principal of and interest, if any, on the Debt Securities, to the extent lawful, and the due and punctual performance of all other obligations of the Company to the holders of Debt Securities or the Trustee all in accordance with the terms of such Debt Security and this Indenture provided that this Guarantee shall not be applicable to, or guarantee the Company's obligation with respect to the
Guarantee
 
conversion of Debt Securities into Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock if applicable to the Debt Securities of such series, and (b) in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Debt Securities or any of such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, by declaration of acceleration or otherwise (the obligations in subsections (a) and (b) hereof being the ""). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Company to the holders of Debt Securities, or the Trustee under the Debt Securities and this Indenture but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Company. The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any such Debt Security or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any such Debt Security or this Indenture, any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Company with respect thereto, by any Guaranteed Party or any other circumstances which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of the Company or a surety or guarantor. The Guarantors hereby waive diligence, presentment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, the benefit of discussion, protest or notice with respect to any such Debt Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever (except as specified above), and covenant that this Guarantee will not be discharged as to any such Debt Security except by payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, pursuant to Article X, or upon conversion of such Debt Security in accordance with Article XIII. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor and the Guaranteed Parties, (x) the maturity of Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article VII for the purpose of the Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article VII, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of this Guarantee. In addition, without limiting the foregoing provisions, upon the effectiveness of an acceleration under Article VII, the Trustee shall promptly make a demand for payment on the Debt Securities under each Guarantee provided for in this Article XIV and not discharged.
Guaranteed Obligations
Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claim or other rights that it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture, or any other document or instrument including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy of the Guaranteed Parties against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Guaranteed Parties, and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the issuance of the Debt Securities and that the waiver set forth in this Section is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
SECTION 14.2 . Nothing contained in this Article XIV elsewhere in this Indenture or in any series of Debt Securities or in the Guarantee is intended to or shall impair, as between the Guarantors and the holders of Debt Securities, the obligations of the Guarantors, which obligations are independent of the obligations of the Company under the Debt Securities and this Indenture and are absolute and unconditional, to pay to the holders of Debt Securities
Obligations of the Guarantors Unconditional
 
the Guaranteed Obligations as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the provisions of this Guarantee and this Indenture, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or any holder of Debt Securities from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon an Event of Default under this Indenture. Each payment to be made by any Guarantor hereunder in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be payable in the currency or currencies in which such Guaranteed Obligations are denominated.
SECTION 14.3 . To evidence its obligations under this Article XIV, each Guarantor hereby agrees to execute a guarantee in a form set forth in the supplemental indenture for such series of Debt Securities, to be endorsed on each Debt Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of the Guarantors as provided in Section 2.4. The signature of any of these officers on the Debt Securities may be manual or facsimile. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in this Article XIV shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse such Guarantee on any series of Debt Securities.
Execution of Guarantee
If an officer whose signature is on this Indenture no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates a Debt Security on which this Guarantee is endorsed, the Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
SECTION 14.4 . All payments made by a Guarantor with respect to the Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any country (other than the United States) or any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein or thereof, having power to tax, unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges is then required by law. In the event that any country (other than the United States) or any political subdivision thereof or any authority therein or thereof, imposes any such withholding or deduction on (a) any payments made by a Guarantor with respect to the Guarantees or (b) any net proceeds on the sale to or exchange with any Guarantor of the Debt Securities, such Guarantor will pay such additional amounts (the "") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments or sale or exchange by the holders of the Debt Securities or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments or sale or exchange in the absence of such withholding or deduction; except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to any series of Debt Securities held by or on behalf of a holder who is liable for such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Debt Security by reason of his being a citizen or resident of, or carrying on a business in, the country of residence of any Guarantor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Guarantor making a payment on the Debt Securities pursuant to the Guarantee shall not be required to pay any Additional Amounts if (x) the beneficial holder of a Debt Security receives by certified mail (evidenced by a return receipt signed by such beneficial holder) (i) written notice from such Guarantor no less than 60 days in advance of making such payment and (ii) the appropriate forms or instructions necessary to enable such beneficial holder to certify or document the availability of an exemption from, or reduction of, the withholding or deduction of such taxes under applicable law, which such instructions shall clearly specify that Additional Amounts hereunder may not be paid if such forms are not completed by such beneficial holder, and (y) the Guarantor that would otherwise have to pay such Additional Amounts establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for the failure of such beneficial holder to (i) duly complete such forms as were actually received by such beneficial holder or respond to such instructions and (ii) provide to such Guarantor such duly completed forms or responses to instructions. Without prejudice to the survival of any of the agreements of the Guarantors hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Guarantors contained in this Section 14.4 shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guarantee.
Withholding
Additional Amounts
 
SECTION 14.5 . The Company and each holder of a Debt Security by his or her acceptance thereof, hereby confirm that it is the intention of all such parties that any Guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations executed by a Guarantor pursuant to this Indenture and the terms of a supplemental indenture for any series of Debt Securities not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or any similar federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the holders of Debt Securities hereby irrevocably agree that (i) in the event that any such Guarantee would constitute or result in a violation of any applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law of any relevant jurisdiction, the liability of the Guarantor under such Guarantee shall be reduced to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor, permissible under the applicable fraudulent conveyance or similar law.
Limitation of Guarantee
SECTION 14.6 .
Release of Guarantee
(a) Concurrently with the payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors shall be released from and relieved of their obligations under this Article XIV. Upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and, if requested by the Trustee, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the transaction giving rise to the release of such obligations was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Debt Securities, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of the Guarantors from their obligations. If any of the Guaranteed Obligations are revived and reinstated after the termination of this Guarantee, then all of the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee shall be revived and reinstated as if this Guarantee had not been terminated until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full, and the Guarantors shall enter into an amendment to this Guarantee, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, evidencing such revival and reinstatement.
(b) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.2 for the Debt Securities of any series, upon any Guarantor being released as a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facility (in connection with a sale of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, a merger of a Guarantor into another Person or otherwise) or in the event the Senior Credit Facility is otherwise terminated or refinanced without a guarantee from such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article XIV. Upon the delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and, if requested by the Trustee, an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the transaction giving rise to the release of such obligations was made in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Debt Securities, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations. Any Guarantor not so released remains liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Debt Securities as provided in this Article XIV.
(c) With respect to any series of Debt Securities, upon conversion of such Debt Security in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII, the Guarantors shall be released from and relieved of their obligations with respect to such Debt Security under this Article XIV. Upon such conversion, if so requested by a Guarantor, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of the Guarantors from their obligations. If any of the Guaranteed Obligations are revived and reinstated after the termination of this
 
Guarantee, then all of the obligations of the Guarantors under this Guarantee shall be revived and reinstated as if this Guarantee had not been terminated until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full, and the Guarantors shall enter into an amendment to this Guarantee, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, evidencing such revival and reinstatement.
 
In the event that a Guarantor (the "") is merged or consolidated with another Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor) in a transaction where such other Person is the surviving entity (the "") and the successor Guarantor is a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facility, the Company shall cause the successor Guarantor to promptly, by an indenture supplemental hereto complying with the provisions of Section 12.1, executed and delivered to the Trustee, expressly assume the obligations of the predecessor Guarantor, just as fully and effectually as if such successor Guarantor had been an original party hereto. Thereafter, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.2 for the Debt Securities of any series, all obligations of the predecessor Guarantor with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall terminate.
predecessor Guarantor
successor Guarantor
Every such successor Guarantor, upon executing an indenture supplemental hereto as provided in this Section 14.7 in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall succeed to and be substituted for predecessor Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor; and any order, certificate or resolution of the Board or officers of a Guarantor provided for in this Indenture may be made by like officials of such successor Guarantor.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the day and year first above written.
