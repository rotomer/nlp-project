The Plan amends and restates in its entirety the Constellation Brands, Inc. Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan that was approved by the Board of Directors of the Company by unanimous written consent as of June 23, 1997, and applies to Awards made on or after July 26, 2007.  Grants of Awards made under this Plan prior to July 26, 2007 shall be governed by the terms of the Plan as of the date of the Award.  Certain capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Annex A.
 
1.           PURPOSE
 
The Plan is designed to provide the Company with increased flexibility to attract and retain valued employees and directors and to provide them with incentives to maintain and enhance the Companys long-term performance record by aligning the interests of the Participants and the stockholders of the Company.
 
2.           ADMINISTRATION
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee.  The Committee shall possess the authority, in its discretion, (a) to determine the employees and directors of the Company to whom Awards shall be granted and the time or times at which Awards shall be granted; (b) to determine at the time of grant the number of shares to be subject to each Award; (c) to prescribe the form of the instrument representing such Award; (d) to establish any appropriate terms and conditions applicable to the Awards including any limitations on grants, vesting or exercisability, and to make any amendments to such instruments or the Awards which may, without limitation, include any acceleration of vesting or exercisability, waiver of any condition or requirement or taking of other action consistent with the purposes of the Plan; (e) to interpret and construe the Plan; (f) to make and amend rules and regulations relating to the Plan; and (g) to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.  The Committees determinations shall be conclusive and binding on all Participants and all persons claiming under or through any Participant.  No member of the Committee shall be liable for any action taken or decision made in good faith relating to the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan.
 
No outstanding Award may be exercised by any person if the Participant to whom the Award is granted (x) is, or at any time after the date of grant has been, in competition with the Company or its affiliates or (y) has been terminated by the Company for Cause.  The Committee shall determine, in its discretion, whether a Participants actions constitute competition with the Company or its affiliates.
 
3.           ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
 
All employees of the Company are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan.  Awards may be made to non-employee directors of the Company.  No Awards under the Plan shall be made to Covered Employees which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code until the Plan is approved by stockholders of the Company.
 
4.           SHARES AVAILABLE; TYPES OF AWARDS
 
The total number of shares of the Companys Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan in the aggregate shall not exceed ninety-four million shares.  The maximum number of Shares which may be subject to Awards granted to any Participant in any fiscal year shall not exceed 1% of the diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding on February 28, 2007.  Shares subject to Awards may be authorized and unissued shares or may be treasury shares.
If an Award expires, terminates or is cancelled without being exercised or becoming vested, new Awards may thereafter be granted under the Plan covering such shares unless the applicable Rules under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act or Section 162(m) of the Code require otherwise.
 
The Committee may make Awards from time to time in any one or more of the following types singly or in tandem:  Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards.

Stock Option Awards under the Constellation Brands, Inc. Stock Option and Stock Appreciation Right Plan made prior to the date this Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors shall remain outstanding and in full force in accordance with their terms.  Each Stock Option Award shall specify the following terms and conditions, as well as any other terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions specified by the Committee:

(c)  .  Each Stock Option granted under the Plan shall become exercisable in five equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant except as otherwise provided by the Committee.  Stock Options may be partially exercised from time to time during the period extending from the time they first become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Award until the expiration of the exercise period specified in the Award.  Exercise of related Stock Appreciation Rights will cause the immediate automatic expiration of related Stock Options on the terms and conditions specified by the Committee. The Committee may impose such additional limitations or conditions on the vesting or exercise of any Stock Option as it deems appropriate.
Exercise Terms
 
(d)  .  A Stock Option shall be exercised upon such notice as is required by the Committee accompanied by payment in full of the exercise price for the Shares being acquired in such form as the Committee may provide in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan, together with all applicable withholding taxes as provided in Section 10 of the Plan.

Tandem Awards may be granted at the same time as the grant of the related Stock Option or at any time thereafter prior to the end of the exercise period for the related Stock Option.
 
(a)  .  The value of each Stock Appreciation Right shall be the difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right and the reference amount specified in the Award, which for each Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with a Stock Option shall be not less than the exercise price of the related Stock Option.  The reference amount for each Stock Appreciation Right granted to a Covered Employee shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right.

(b)  .  The duration of each Stock Appreciation Right shall be specified.  Each tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall specify the Stock Option to which it is related and the terms and conditions under which exercise or expiration of the related Stock Option will result in automatic expiration of the related Stock Appreciation Right and the terms and conditions on which exercise or expiration of the Stock Appreciation Right will result in automatic expiration of the related Stock Option.
Duration of Stock Appreciation Right
 
(c)  .  Each Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall become exercisable in five equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant except as otherwise provided by the Committee.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be partially exercised from time to time during the period extending from the time they first become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the Award until the expiration of the exercise period specified in the Award.  Exercise of related Stock Options will cause the immediate automatic expiration of related Stock Appreciation Rights on the terms and conditions specified by the Committee.  The Committee may impose such additional limitations or conditions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as specified in the Award as it deems appropriate, including such additional limitations or conditions on the vesting or exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it deems appropriate.

7.           RESTRICTED STOCK
 
Shares of Restricted Stock may be granted by the Committee from time to time in its discretion to Participants subject to such terms and conditions as may be required by law or are specified in the Award, including any payment required for the Shares.  The Award will also specify the availability of dividends and other distributions with respect to which Shares of Restricted Stock are entitled and the voting rights, if any, associated with such Shares of Restricted Stock.  Restricted Stock Awards to Participants who may be Covered Employees which are intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code shall only be made if payout is contingent upon achievement of Performance Targets within or at the end of the Performance Period with respect to one or more Performance Criteria as specified by the Committee and the Committee certifies the extent to which any Performance Target has been satisfied and the number of Shares of Restricted Stock deliverable as a result thereof, prior to the delivery of any such Shares to Covered Employees.  In any fiscal year, the value of Restricted Stock Awards to any individual Covered Employee shall not exceed $5 million (measured by the difference between the amount of any payment for the Shares by the Participant and the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of the Award).
 
8.           OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS
 
From time to time in its discretion, the Committee may grant Other Stock-Based Awards to any Participant on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee and specified in the Award.  Grants of Other Stock-Based Awards to Participants who may be Covered Employees which are intended to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code shall only be made if payout or exercise is contingent upon achievement of Performance Targets within or at the end of the Performance Period with respect to one or more Performance Criteria as specified by the Committee and the Committee certifies the extent to which any Performance Target has been satisfied, and the number of Shares or other compensation deliverable as a result thereof, prior to the delivery of any such Shares or compensation to Covered Employees.  Any exercise of Other Stock-Based Awards shall be made upon such notice as is required by the Committee to the Company accompanied by payment in full of any exercise price for the Shares or other compensation being acquired in such form as the Committee may provide in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan, together with all applicable withholding taxes as provided in Section 10 of the Plan.  In any fiscal year, the value of Other Stock-Based Awards to any individual Covered Employee shall not exceed $5 million (measured by the difference between the amount of any payment or exercise price for the Award by the Participant and the Fair Market Value of the Shares or the Award on the date of the Award).
 
9.           PAYMENT FOR PURCHASE OR EXERCISE OF AWARDS
 
The exercise price of Stock Options and any Other Stock-Based Awards providing for exercise prices and the purchase price for any Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Awards for purchase prices shall be paid to the Company upon exercise or acquisition of such Award  in the manner which the Committee may determine which may include by (a) delivery of cash or a check in the amount of the price of the Award, (b) tendering previously acquired Shares having a Fair Market Value at the time of delivery equal to the price of the Award, (c) delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker or other agent acceptable to the Company to promptly sell Shares received under the Award and to deliver to the Company the amount of proceeds to pay the price related to such Award, or (d) such other method of payment as the Committee in its discretion deems appropriate, in each case together with all applicable withholding taxes as provided in Section 10.  Previously acquired Shares tendered in payment must have been owned by Participant for at least six months prior to the tender in payment of an Award.
 
10.           WITHHOLDING TAXES
 
Whenever required by law in connection with an Award, the Company shall (and whenever permitted by law in connection with an Award the Company may but is not obligated to) require the Participant to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and/or local income tax, foreign tax, social charge and employment withholding tax requirements prior to the delivery of any certificate or certificates for Shares or to take any other appropriate action to satisfy such withholding requirements, including any method permitted for payment under Section 9 as determined by the Committee.  To the extent permitted under such rules as the Committee may promulgate and in compliance with any requirements to avoid violations under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and related Rules, the Participant may satisfy such obligation in whole or in part by electing to have the Company withhold Shares from the Shares to which the Participant is otherwise entitled under the Award.
 
11.           PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
 
For each Award of Restricted Stock or Other Stock-Based Award intended to qualify as performance based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and related Rules, the Committee shall select the applicable Performance Criteria, Performance Period and Performance Target for the Award consistent with the terms of the Plan and Section 162(m).  The Committee may select Performance Criteria, Performance Periods and Performance Targets for Restricted Stock and Other Stock-Based Awards for Participants other than Covered Employees in its discretion.  The Committee shall have no discretion to increase the amount of compensation payable to Covered Employees if a Performance Target has been attained, but the Committee may adjust compensation to increase the amount, in its discretion, to any other Participant.  The Committee may adjust Performance Targets to take into account the effects of any Extraordinary Items equitably in a manner consistent with the determination of the original Award, provided, however, no such adjustment may be made with respect to any Award to a Covered Employee which is intended to qualify as performance based compensation unless such adjustment satisfies the requirements of Code Section 162(m) and the related Rules.
 
For Awards to Covered Employees which are intended to qualify as performance based compensation under Code Section 162(m), the Performance Target with respect to the selected Performance Criteria must be established by the Committee in advance of the deadlines applicable under Code Section 162(m) and the Rules thereunder and while the performance relating to the Performance Target remains substantially uncertain within the meaning of such Section 162(m) and Rules.  At the time the Performance Targets are established, the Committee shall provide, in terms of an objective formula or standard for each Covered Employee, the method of computing the specific amount that will represent the maximum number of Shares or amount of other compensation payable to the Participant if the Performance Target is attained.
 
12.           AWARDS NOT TRANSFERABLE
 
Unless transferability is permitted under certain conditions as determined by the Committee, no Award is transferable by the Participant other than (i) by will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) pursuant to a domestic relations order, or (iii) to the extent permitted under the Plan, the Award or interpretation of the Committee, by gift to family members or by gift or permitted non-cash exchange to entities beneficially owned by family members or other permitted transferees, and shall be exercisable only by the Participant, the Participants legal representative, or the Participants permitted transferees.  Shares of  Restricted Stock may not be sold or otherwise transferred until ownership vests in the Participant.
 
13.           GENERAL RESTRICTION ON ISSUANCE OF STOCK CERTIFICATES
 
The Company shall not be required to deliver any certificate upon the grant, vesting or exercise of any Award until it has been furnished with such documents as it may deem necessary to insure compliance with any law or Rules of the SEC or any other governmental authority having jurisdiction under the Plan.  Certificates for Shares delivered upon such grant or exercise shall bear legends restricting transfer or other restrictions or conditions to the extent required by law or determined by the Committee.  Each Award under the Plan is subject to the condition that, if at any time the Committee shall determine that the listing, registration or qualification of the Shares subject to such Award under any state or federal law or other applicable Rule, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of the granting of such Awards or the issue or purchase of Shares thereunder, such Awards may not vest or be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
 
14.           TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
 
If the employment of a Participant terminates by reason of the Participants Retirement, Disability or death, any Award may be exercised or received by the Participant, the Participants designated beneficiary or legal representative or permitted transferee at any time on or prior to the earlier of the expiration date of the Award or the expiration of one year after the date of Retirement, Disability or death but only if, and to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise or receive the Award at the date of Retirement, Disability or death and subject to such other terms and conditions as may be specified in the Award and the Plan.  All Awards or any portion thereof not yet vested or exercisable on the date of Retirement, Disability or death shall become immediately vested and exercisable on the date of termination due to Retirement, Disability or death (except as otherwise provided by the Committee or an employment agreement between the Company and the Participant).  Upon termination of the Participants employment for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, any Award may be exercised or received by the Participant, the Participants designated beneficiary or legal representative or permitted transferee at any time on or prior to the earlier of the expiration date of the Award or the expiration of ninety days after the date of termination but only if, and to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise or receive the Award at the date of termination and subject to such other terms and conditions as may be specified in the Award and the Plan.  All Awards or any portion thereof not yet vested or exercisable on the date of termination other than by reason of Retirement, Disability or death shall terminate immediately on the date of termination (except as otherwise provided by the Committee or an employment agreement between the Company and the Participant).
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, an authorized leave of absence pursuant to a written agreement or other leave entitling the Participant to reemployment in a comparable position by law or Rule shall not constitute a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan unless the Participant does not return at or before the end of the authorized leave or within the period for which re-employment is guaranteed by law or Rule.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee has the authority to prescribe different rules that apply upon the termination of employment of a particular Participant, which shall be memorialized in the Participants original or amended Award or similar document.
 
15.           ADJUSTMENT OF AWARDS
 
In the event of any change in the Common Stock of the Company by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination, or exchange of shares, or rights offering to purchase Common Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or of any similar change affecting the Common Stock, the number and kind of shares authorized under Section 4 for the Plan (including, to the extent permitted by Code Section 162(m), the limit in Section 4 on Awards to any Participant in any fiscal year), the number and kind of shares which thereafter are subject to an Award under the Plan and the number and kind of unexercised Stock Options or Other Stock-Based Awards and the number of Shares of Restricted Stock and the price per share shall be adjusted automatically consistent with such change to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants in the Plan.
 
16.           NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS
 
The Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to continuance as an employee of the Company, nor shall the Plan or such Awards interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Participants position as an employee or director at any time.
 
17.           RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER
 
The recipient of any Award under the Plan shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect thereto unless and until certificates for the underlying Shares are issued to the recipient, except as otherwise specifically provided by the Committee.
 
18.           SECTION 162(m) CONDITIONS
 
It is the intent of the Company that all Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) be granted and interpreted in a manner to satisfy all applicable requirements of Code Section 162(m).  Any provision, application or interpretation of the Plan inconsistent with this intent to satisfy the standards in Code Section 162(m) shall be disregarded.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the provisions of the Plan may at any time be bifurcated by the Committee in any manner so that certain provisions of the Plan or any Award intended (or required in order) to satisfy the applicable requirements of Code Section 162(m) may be applicable only to Covered Employees.
 
19.           AMENDMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE
 
The Plan and any Award outstanding under the Plan may be amended, modified or terminated by the Committee at any time and all Awards shall be subject to the Plan, as amended from time to time, except that the Committee may not, without approval of the Participant to whom the Award was granted or his legal representative or permitted transferee adversely affect the rights of such person under such Award. No amendment, modification, or termination of the Plan shall be effective without stockholder approval if such approval is required under applicable law or Rule or any regulation of the stock market on which the Common Stock is traded.
 
20.           CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
(a)  Notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control of the Company, all of a Participants Awards shall become immediately vested and exercisable or fully earned at the maximum amount, except with respect to  Covered Employees for performance based compensation as otherwise determined by the Committee.
 
(b)  In the event of a Change in Control, in the discretion of the Committee, each Participant who is a Section 16 insider with respect to whom the Change in Control might result in a violation under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, may receive, in exchange for the surrender of the Stock Option, an amount of cash equal to the difference between the fair market value (based on the kind and amount of any securities, cash, other property or other consideration to be received with respect to each Share in the Change in Control transaction as determined by the Committee) of the Common Stock covered by the Award and the option price of such Common Stock under the Stock Option or to receive, in exchange for any other Award, an amount of cash equivalent to such fair market value had the Participant received the Shares or other compensation as intended under the Award prior to the Change in Control.
 
(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan and any Awards outstanding under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor to the Company, whether such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
 
21.           PARTICIPANTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
 
The Committee shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans, in each case which may differ from the terms specified in this Plan, as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.

Exhibit 99.4
 
This Annual Management Incentive Plan (amended and restated as of July 26, 2007) is adopted pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan by the Committee, and by the stockholders of the Company.  The Plan amends and restates in its entirety the Constellation Brands, Inc. Annual Management Incentive Plan that was approved by the Board of Directors on June 23, 1997.  Certain capitalized terms used in the Plan are defined in Annex A.
 
 
The Plan is designed to enable the Company to attract and retain valued employees and to provide them with incentives to attain certain annual performance goals.
 
 
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.  This Committee shall consist of at least two members of the Companys Board of Directors, all of whom are (a) outside directors within the meaning of Section 162(m) and (b) not eligible to participate in the Plan.  Subject to the Plan, the Committee shall possess the sole authority, in its discretion, to (i) establish and administer the Performance Criteria and Performance Target, (ii) select the Participating Executives who will receive Bonuses under the Plan, (iii) determine the amount of such Bonuses and any terms, conditions or limitations on the payment of any Bonuses, (iv) interpret the Plan, (v) make and amend rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and (vi) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
 
3.            TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF BONUSES
 
For each Performance Period, the Committee shall select, at the time the Performance Criteria and Performance Targets are determined, the Participating Executives.  Each Participating Executive may receive a Bonus if and only if the Performance Targets established by the Committee, relative to the applicable Performance Criteria, are attained.  The applicable Performance Period and Performance Targets shall be determined by the Committee consistent with the terms of the Plan and Section 162(m).  The Committee may adjust Performance Targets to take into account the effects of any Extraordinary Items equitably in a manner consistent with the determination of the original Bonus, provided, however, no such adjustment may be made with respect to any Bonus to a Participating Executive which is intended to qualify as performance based compensation unless such adjustment satisfies the requirements of Section 162(m) and the related Rules.
 
The Performance Target with respect to the Performance Criteria must be established by the Committee in advance of the deadlines applicable under Section 162(m) and while the performance relating to the Performance Target remains substantially uncertain within the meaning of Section 162(m).  At the time the Performance Target is established, the Committee shall provide, in terms of an objective formula or standard for each Participating Executive, the method of computing the specific amount that will represent the maximum amount of Bonus payable to the Participant if the Performance Target is attained.
 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Participating Executive shall receive a Bonus under the Plan for any fiscal year or other Performance Period in excess of $5 million.  Any Bonuses awarded by the Committee under the Plan shall be paid within 30 days after year-end financial results are reported or, if later, as soon as practicable following the Committees determinations and certification under this Section.  Any such payment shall be in cash or cash equivalent, subject to applicable withholding requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, defer the payout of any Bonus.  In the case of the delay of a Bonus otherwise payable at or after the attainment and certification of the applicable Performance Target, any additional amount payable as a result of the delay shall be limited to the Moodys Average Corporate Bond Yield during the deferral period.
 
No Participating Executive shall receive any payment under the Plan unless the Committee has certified, by resolution or other appropriate action in writing, that the amount thereof has been accurately determined in accordance with the terms, conditions and limits of the Plan and that the Performance Target and any other material terms previously established by the Committee or set forth in the Plan were in fact satisfied.
 
 
If the employment of a Participating Executive terminates by reason of such Participating Executives Retirement, Disability, death or involuntary termination without Cause, a ratable portion of any applicable Bonus shall be paid, subject to the attainment of the applicable Performance Target, at or after the attainment and certification of the applicable Performance Target at the end of the fiscal year or other Performance Period.  The ratable portion of the Bonus shall be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full or partial months during the Performance Period during which the Participating Executive was employed, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar months in the Performance Period.  Upon termination of the Participating Executives employment by voluntary resignation or for Cause, all Bonuses for which the Participating Executive may be eligible shall be forfeited unless the Committee otherwise expressly so provides in a written contract or other written instrument.
 
5.           ADJUSTMENTS
 
In the event of any change in the Companys applicable accounting principles or practices or by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, rights offering or other similar change which occurs after the Performance Targets are established for a given Performance Period, the amount of the Bonuses paid under the Plan for such Performance Period shall be automatically adjusted consistent with such change to prevent dilution or enlargement of the Bonuses under the Plan.
 
6.           NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS
 
The Plan shall not confer upon any Participating Executive any right with respect to continuance as an employee of the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the Participating Executives position as an employee.
 
7.           DISCRETION OF COMPANY
 
Any decision made or action taken by the Company, the Committee or the Board of Directors in connection with the creation, amendment, construction, administration, interpretation or effect of the Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of such entity and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons.  No officer, director or member of the Committee shall have any liability for actions taken or omitted under the Plan by the member or by any other person.
 
8.           AMENDMENT AND DISCONTINUANCE
 
The Plan may be amended, modified or terminated by the Committee at any time, and all Bonuses shall be subject to the Plan as amended from time to time, except that the Committee may not, without the approval of a Participating Executive adversely affect any rights under the Plan.  No amendment, modification or termination shall be effective without the approval of the Board of Directors and/or the stockholders if such approval is necessary to comply with the applicable provisions of Section l62(m).
 
9.           CHANGE OF CONTROL
 
Notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, the Performance Period for a Participating Executive shall end on the date of the Change of Control and the Performance Target shall be adjusted to reflect the early termination of the Performance Period.  If the Performance Target, as adjusted, is deemed satisfied by the Committee, the Participating Executive may receive a ratable portion of the Bonus that would have been paid if the Performance Period had not been terminated early and the Performance Target had been satisfied.  The ratable portion of the Bonus shall be determined by multiplying the original Bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months from the first day of the Performance Period to the date of the Change of Control (including any fractional month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the original Performance Period.
 
The Plan shall be binding upon any successor to the Company, whether such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation or other acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
 
10.             SECTION 162(m) CONDITIONS
 
It is the intent of the Company that the Plan and Bonuses paid under the Plan satisfy and be interpreted in a manner that satisfies any applicable requirements of Section 162(m) as performance-based compensation.  Any provision, application or interpretation of the Plan inconsistent with this intent to satisfy the standards in Section 162(m) shall be disregarded.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the provisions of the Plan may at any time be bifurcated by the Committee in any manner so that certain provisions of the Plan or any Bonus intended (or required in order) to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 162(m) are applicable only to persons whose compensation is subject to Section 162(m).
 
11.             NO FUNDING OF THE PLAN
 
The Company shall not be required to fund or otherwise segregate any cash or any other assets which may at any time be paid to any Participating Executive under the Plan.  The Plan shall constitute an unfunded plan of the Company.  The Company shall not, by any provisions of the Plan, be deemed to be a trustee of any property, and any rights of any Participating Executive shall be limited to those of a general unsecured creditor.
 
 
Except as expressly provided by the Committee, no benefit payable under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge, and any such attempted action shall be void.  This Section shall not apply to an assignment of a contingency or payment due after the death of a Participating Executive to such Participating Executives legal representative or beneficiary.
 
 
The effective date of the Plan shall be the date the Plan was initially approved by the Companys stockholders.
