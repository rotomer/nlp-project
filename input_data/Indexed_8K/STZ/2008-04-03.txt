NEWS RELEASE
02
FAIRPORT, N.Y., April 3, 2008
 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ, ASX: CBR),
 
a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol today reported its fiscal 2008 financial results and fiscal 2009 outlook. For fiscal 2008, we achieved our strategic initiatives and exceeded our key financial goals, stated Rob Sands, Constellation Brands president and chief executive officer. These include
the premiumization of brand portfolios, including the acquisition of SVEDKA Vodka and the Fortune Brands U.S. premium wine portfolio and the sale of the Almaden and Inglenook value wine brands, successful implementation of the Crown Imports transition, reduction of U.S. distributor wine inventory and creation of a strategic joint venture for the companys U.K. wholesale business.
 
We exceeded our comparable earnings per share estimate for the year and generated record free cash flow of $376 million, which also exceeded our forecast, added Sands. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute our strategy, profitably grow our business and generate strong cash flow.
On a reported basis the company incurred a net loss of $610 million, or $2.82 diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended Feb. 29, 2008 (fiscal 2008), compared to net income of $332 million, or $1.38 diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the prior year. The net loss was driven by an estimated $822 million of impairment charges primarily related to goodwill and intangible assets associated with the companys Australia and U.K. businesses and a $52 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
These are non-cash, non-recurring charges to earnings and do not impact the companys free cash flow, debt covenants or future operations, said Bob Ryder, Constellation Brands chief financial officer.
 
Fiscal 2008 net income on a comparable basis, which excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring charges and unusual items, totaled $321 million, or $1.44 diluted EPS versus comparable basis net income of $403 million and diluted EPS of $1.68 for the prior year.

Fiscal 2008 Net Sales Commentary
The reported consolidated net sales decrease of 28 percent primarily reflects the impact of reporting the Crown Imports and Matthew Clark wholesale business joint ventures under the equity method and U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction, partially offset by the benefits of the Vincor, SVEDKA and Fortune Brands U.S. premium wine business acquisitions and favorable foreign currency. Organic net sales increased one percent on a constant currency basis.
-2-
Branded wine net sales decreased two percent on an organic constant currency basis. For North America, branded wine net sales decreased three percent on an organic constant currency basis, reflecting solid growth in Canada, which was more than offset by the companys initiative to reduce U.S. wine distributor inventory levels during the first half of fiscal 2008.
 
The North American wine market remains healthy, with consumers continuing the trend of trading up to premium wines such as Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, which we added to our leading premium portfolio that includes consumer favorites such as Simi, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Kim Crawford, and Toasted Head in the U.S., and Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin in Canada, explained Sands. These brands all delivered positive sales and marketplace growth for the year.
 
Organic net sales for branded wine in Europe increased four percent on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher sales of popular priced wine in mainland Europe and a slight increase in net sales for the U.K. On a constant currency basis, net sales for Australia/New Zealand branded wine decreased two percent.
 
Total spirits net sales increased 26 percent, primarily due to the March 2007 acquisition of SVEDKA and nine percent growth in organic net sales reflecting higher average selling prices and an increase in production services.
 
SVEDKA continues delivering phenomenal sales performance and remains the fastest growing major imported premium vodka brand in the U.S., said Sands. We are also very pleased with the marketplace growth generated by other premium spirits in our portfolio, including Effen Vodka, the 99 Schnapps line, Ridgemont Reserve 1792 bourbon and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky.
 
Fiscal 2008 Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
 
The decrease in comparable operating income and the increase in equity earnings for fiscal 2008 were primarily due to the impact of reporting $255 million
of equity earnings from the Crown Imports joint venture under the equity method for the entire 12 months in fiscal 2008, compared to $39 million in equity earnings for the two months of Crown Imports operations in fiscal 2007.
-3-
Wines segment operating income decreased $72 million versus the prior year. This was primarily due to the lower net sales associated with efforts to reduce distributor inventories in the U.S., the impact of the U.K. and Australia business performance, and higher stock compensation expense, which was partially offset by an increased contribution from the Canadian wine business. Spirits segment operating income increased $7 million primarily due to the addition of SVEDKA and from the increase in base business net sales, offset somewhat by higher material costs.
 
For fiscal 2008, pre-tax acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items totaled $913 million, compared to $91 million for the prior year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the company recorded an estimated $822 million of non-cash impairment charges primarily related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments associated with the companys Australia and U.K. businesses in connection with the companys annual impairment testing and a $52 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance. As previously discussed by the company, operating results for these businesses have been impacted by pricing pressures driven by the strength of large grocery retailers, Australian wine over-supply and U.K. duty increases. Due to these competitive pressures, the companys profitability in the U.K. and Australia businesses has decreased over the past few years. U.S. GAAP h
as required the company to recognize impairment charges resulting from the impact of these competitive pressures on prospective operating results.
 
The U.K. is one of the worlds largest import wine markets and wine consumption trends remain robust, while Australia is one of the largest and most progressive producers and exporters of high quality New World Wines, stated Sands. We believe in the long-term value of both of these businesses, and are confident we are taking the right measures to improve operating efficiencies and our competitive position in these strategically important markets. We plan to improve operating results in fiscal 2009 and beyond.
-4-
Financial results were also impacted by interest expense, which increased 27 percent to $342 million for fiscal 2008, primarily due to the financing of the Vincor, SVEDKA and Fortune Brands U.S. wine business acquisitions, and $500 million of share repurchases. Comparable basis net income for fiscal 2008 reflected an effective tax rate of 32.6 percent versus 35.6 percent for the prior year, primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate changes.
 
The company generated record free cash flow of $376 million versus $121 million in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by reduced working capital investment, including reduced tax payments, and lower capital spending. The company expects the strong free cash flow generation to continue and is targeting free cash flow in the range of $310 - $340 million for fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2008 demonstrated our increased focus on free cash flow management and we expect another strong year of cash generation in fiscal 2009, said Ryder.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2008 Net Sales Commentary
The reported consolidated net sales decrease of 23 percent primarily reflects the impact of reporting the Crown Imports and Matthew Clark wholesale business joint ventures under the equity method. The impact of the joint venture reporting was partially offset by the benefits of favorable foreign currency and the SVEDKA and Fortune Brands U.S. wine business acquisitions.
-5-
Branded wine net sales decreased two percent on an organic constant currency basis. For North America, branded wine net sales decreased five percent on an organic constant currency basis, as the completion of the reduction in U.S. wine distributor inventories earlier in the year resulted in a timing shift for the companys U.S. wine sales. Under new shipment patterns, and after the peak holiday selling period in the third quarter, the company returned to the lower distributor inventory levels achieved at the end of the second quarter, which negatively impacted growth in the fourth quarter.
 
Branded wine organic net sales on a constant currency basis for Europe and Australia/New Zealand increased four percent and eight percent, respectively.
 
Total spirits net sales increased 31 percent for the quarter, primarily due to the SVEDKA acquisition and 10 percent growth in organic net sales.
 
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2008 Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
 
Wines segment operating income decreased $10 million versus the prior year, while spirits segment operating income increased $1 million.
 
Pre-tax acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items totaled $888 million, which included the non-cash impairment charges discussed earlier, compared to $23 million for the prior year. Interest expense increased 25 percent to $93 million for fourth quarter 2008, primarily due to the financing of the SVEDKA and Fortune Brands U.S. wine business acquisitions and $500 million of share repurchases.
 
Outlook
 
The table below sets forth managements current diluted earnings per share expectations for fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 actual results, both on a reported basis and a comparable basis.
 
The expected improvement in comparable earnings for fiscal 2009 includes solid underlying growth of our North America branded wine business and the Crown Imports joint venture, the benefit of completing the reduction in U.S. distributor inventories during fiscal 2008 and anticipated performance improvement for the companys U.K. and Australia branded wine businesses, said Sands.

Explanations
 
Reported basis (reported) operating income, equity in earnings of equity method investees, net income and diluted earnings per share are as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Operating income, equity in earnings of equity method investees, net income and diluted earnings per share on a comparable basis (comparable), exclude acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items. The companys measure of segment profitability excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and unusual items, which is consistent with the measure used by management to evaluate results.
 
The company discusses additional non-GAAP measures in this news release, including constant currency net sales, organic net sales, comparable
basis EBIT and free cash flow.
 
Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, together with definitions of these measures and the reasons management uses these measures, are included in this news release.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED, ORGANIC AND CONSTANT CURRENCY NET SALES
(in millions)
As the Company acquired Vincor on June 5, 2006, formed its imported beer joint venture on January 2, 2007, acquired Svedka on March 19, 2007, formed its U.K. wholesale joint venture on April 17, 2007, and acquired BWE on December 17, 2007, organic net sales for the respective periods are defined by the Company as reported net sales less net sales of Vincor products, net sales of imported beers, net sales of Svedka products, net sales of U.K. wholesale, plus net sales of U.K. branded wine, or net sales of BWE products, as appropriate. Organic net sales and percentage increase (decrease) in constant currency net sales (which excludes the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations) are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the company. In addition, the company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.

Free Cash Flow Guidance
 
Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
