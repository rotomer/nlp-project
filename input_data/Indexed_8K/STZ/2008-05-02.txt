(e)       Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
At a meeting held on April 28, 2008, the Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Constellation Brands, Inc. (the Company) took the following action with regard to certain compensatory arrangements for the Companys Executive Officers.
Criteria for 2009 Fiscal Year Incentive Awards
The Committee adopted the 2009 Fiscal Year Award Program for Executive Officers (the 2009 Program for Executive Officers), thereby establishing the performance criteria and targets under the Companys Annual Management Incentive Plan (the AMIP) for the Companys fiscal year ending February 28, 2009.  Pursuant to the 2009 Program for Executive Officers, incentive awards for the Companys 2009 fiscal year, if any, will be based on a percentage of base salary, depending upon the participants management position, and achieved Company performance or achieved Company and division performance during the plan year.
As only Executive Officers of the Company participate in the 2009 Program for Executive Officers, performance will be based solely upon achieved Company performance or a combination of achieved Company and division performance for the plan year.  Performance targets are based upon:
Assuming that the same level of performance is achieved for all applicable performance criteria noted above, potential awards for Richard Sands and Robert Sands range from 30% to 240% and potential awards for all other Executive Officers range from 17.5% to 140%.
