(e)       Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
The Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors (the Board) of Constellation Brands, Inc. (the Company) determined that it was appropriate to formalize and standardize the employment arrangements with respect to the Companys current executive officers (collectively, the Executive Officers and individually, an Executive Officer).  To that end, on May 21, 2008, the Company and each of its Executive Officers, including persons who are expected to be named executive officers in the proxy statement for the Companys 2008 annual meeting, entered into executive employment agreements (collectively, the Employment Agreements and individually, an Employment Agreement).  The Employment Agreements supersede any currently existing employment agreements or employment letter arrangements between an Executive Officer and the Company or its affiliates.
In general, each Employment Agreement contains provisions concerning terms of employment, voluntary and involuntary termination, retirement, severance payments, and other termination benefits including the continuation of perquisites.  Richard Sands, Chairman of the Board, and Robert Sands, President and Chief Executive Officer, have substantially similar Employment Agreements and the form of their Employment Agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Other than with respect to the Employment Agreement with Jose F. Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer, Constellation Wines North America, and the Employment Agreement with Alexander L. Berk, Chief Executive Officer, Constellation Beers and Spirits, the form of the Employment Agreement the Company has entered into with each other Executive Officer is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  Mr. Fernandezs Employment Agreement and Mr. Berks Employment Agreement are filed, respectively, as Exhibits 99.3 and 99.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The term of each of the Employment Agreements runs from May 21, 2008 until February 28, 2011, provided that on February 28, 2011, and on each subsequent anniversary thereof, the term shall automatically be extended by the parties for an additional one-year period, until the Company or its applicable affiliate gives the Executive Officer notice, not less than 180 days prior to February 28, 2011, or an anniversary thereof, of a decision not to extend the Employment Agreement for an additional one-year period.
The Employment Agreements provide for an initial annual base salary level for each Executive Officer, which may be adjusted upwards by the Committee.  The following table sets forth the initial, base salary levels set forth in the Employment Agreements for those Executive Officers identified below:
annual
 
 
 
 
Each Employment Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.  The Employment Agreements for each of the Chairman of the Board and the President and Chief Executive Officer provide for a cash payment equal to three (3) times base salary and three (3) times the average annual bonus paid to the Executive Officer over the prior three fiscal years, as well as the continuation of certain benefits and perquisites for a period of three (3) years, in the event the Employment Agreement expires or his employment is terminated due to his death or Disability, by him for a Good Reason Termination, due to his Retirement, or by the Company for any reason other than a For Cause Termination (as each term is defined in the Employment Agreement).  The Employment Agreement for each other Executive Officer provides for a cash payment equal to two (2) times base salary and two (2) times the average annual bonus paid to the Executive Officer over the prior three fiscal years, as well as the continuation of certain benefits and perquisites for a period of two (2) years, in the event the Employment Agreement expires or his employment is terminated due to his death or Disability, by him for a Good Reason Termination, due to his Retirement, or by the Company for any reason other than a For Cause Termination (as each term is defined in the Employment Agreement).  Each Executive Officer (including Messrs. Richard Sands and Robert Sands) would also receive up to 18 months of outplacement services under these circumstances.
In addition, the Employment Agreements contain restrictions upon the Executive Officers ability, during and after the period of employment, to use confidential information or trade secrets of the Company, to provide services that are competitive with the Company, and to solicit or induce employees to terminate their employment relationships with the Company.
The Employment Agreement with Mr. Fernandez also reflects certain payments and benefits that are applicable during his term of employment for so long as the Company requires him to maintain two primary business locations.  As Mr. Berk is employed by Barton Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, both Barton Incorporated and the Company are parties to the Employment Agreement with Mr. Berk.

Restrictive Covenant
(a)           Executive agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) provided that Executive is entitled to the payment under Section 6(b) or is terminated due to a For Cause Termination, for a period of three (3) years after he ceases employment, he will not, without the written consent of Constellation, seek or obtain a position with a Competitor (as defined below) in which Executive will use or is likely to use any confidential information or trade secrets of Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation, or in which Executive has duties for such Competitor that involve Competitive Services (as defined below) and that are the same or similar to those services actually performed by Executive for Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation.  The parties agree that Executive may continue service on any boards of directors on which he is serving while employed by Constellation or its affiliates.  If Executives employment is terminated by Executive for a Good Reason Termination or by Constellation for any reason other than a For Cause Termination, then Constellation will not unreasonably withhold such consent provided Constellation receives information and assurances, satisfactory to Constellation, regarding Executives new position.
(b)           Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between Constellation and its affiliates and each of their respective employees constitutes a valuable asset of Constellation and its affiliates and may not be converted to Executives own use.  Accordingly, Executive hereby agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) for a period of eighteen months (18) months after he ceases employment, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of another person, solicit or induce any employee to terminate his or her employment relationship with Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation or to enter into employment with another person.  The foregoing shall not apply to employees who respond to solicitations of employment directed to the general public or who seek employment at their own initiative.
(c)           For the purposes of this Section 8, Competitive Services means the provision of goods or services that are competitive with any goods or services offered by Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation including, but not limited to manufacturing, importing, exporting, distributing or selling wine, beer, liquor or other alcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.  The parties acknowledge that Constellation or its affiliates may from time to time during the term of this Agreement change or increase the line of goods or services it provides and its geographic markets, and Executive agrees that this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended from time to time to include such different or additional goods, services, and geographic markets to the definition of Competitive Services for purposes of this Section 8.  Competitor means any individual or any entity or enterprise engaged, wholly or in part, in Competitive Services.
(d)           Executive agrees that, due to his position of trust and confidence, the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable, and the benefits conferred on him in this Agreement, including his compensation, are adequate consideration, and, since the
 
- 5 -
 
nature of Constellations and its affiliates collective business is international in scope, the geographic restriction herein is reasonable.
(e)           Executive acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will cause irreparable injury and damage, which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, he acknowledges that the remedies of injunction and specific performance shall be available in the event of such a breach, and Constellation shall be entitled to money damages, costs and attorneys fees, and other legal or equitable remedies, including an injunction pending trial, without the posting of bond or other security. Any period of restriction set forth in this Section 8 shall be extended for a period of time equal to the duration of any breach or violation thereof.
(f)           In the event of Executives breach of this Section 8, in addition to the injunctive relief described above, Constellations remedy shall include (i) the right to require Executive to account for and pay over to Constellation all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Executive as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the restrictive covenants in this Section 8, and (ii) in the case of a breach during the term of Executives employment hereunder, the termination of all compensation otherwise payable to Executive under Sections 3 and 4 with respect to the period of time after such breach, or (iii) in the case of a breach during the period described in Section 8(a)(ii) or 8(b)(ii) above, the forfeiture to Constellation of any payment made under Sections 6(b) herein.
(g)           In the event that any provision of this Section 8 is held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction, then the court so holding may modify the terms thereof, including the period of time during which it operates or the geographic area to which it applies, or effect any other change to the extent necessary to render this Section 8 enforceable, it being acknowledged by the parties that the representations and covenants set forth herein are of the essence of this Agreement.
9.         .
Certain Additional Payments by Constellation
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9 (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or similar section (provided that Section 409A shall not be treated as a similar section), or any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment
 
- 6 -
 
equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  It is the intention of the parties that Constellation provide Executive with a full tax gross-up under the provisions of this Section 9(a) so that on a net after-tax basis, the result to Executive shall be the same as if the Excise Tax had not been imposed on a Payment.
 
(b)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 9 (including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination) shall be made by the nationally recognized accounting firm serving as Constellations independent accounting firm (the Accounting Firm).  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both Constellation and Executive within 20 business days of Constellations receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a Payment or at such earlier time as is requested by Constellation.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control, Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Constellation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to Section 9(a), shall be paid by Constellation to Executive within 10 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Constellation and Executive.  The above provisions of this paragraph (b) notwithstanding, payments due to Executive under this Section 9 shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive remits such excise tax or such earlier date as may be required to comply with Section 409A.
 
   (c)           As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by Constellation should have been made (the Underpayment) or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made that should not have been made (Overpayments), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive.  If the Accounting Firm shall determine that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall promptly repay the amount of the Overpayment to Constellation.
10.        .  Executive agrees that unless duly authorized in writing by Constellation, he will neither during his employment by Constellation or its affiliates nor at any time thereafter divulge or use in connection with any business activity other than that of Constellation or its affiliates any trade secrets or confidential information first acquired by him during and by virtue of his employment with Constellation or its affiliates.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
11.        .  Constellation and its successors and/or assigns will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Executive to the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of

In addition, Constellation will advance to Executive reasonable legal fees and expenses, as such fees and expenses are incurred by Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject only to any requirements as are imposed by law.  Executive shall not unreasonably withhold his consent to the settlement of any claim for monetary damages for which Executive is entitled to full indemnification hereunder.  Executive shall be covered, in respect of his activities as an officer or director of Constellation, by any Directors and Officers liability policy or other similar policies maintained or obtained by Constellation or any of its successors and/or assigns to the fullest extent permitted by such policies.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Executives rights under this Section 11 shall survive the Termination Date and the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall continue without limit for so long as Executive may be subject to any claims covered by this Section 11.  No amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Constellation after the date of this Agreement will affect or impair Executives rights under this Section 11 even with respect to any action taken or not taken by Executive after the effective date of any such amendment.
12.        .  Any and all notices referred to herein shall be sufficient if furnished in writing and sent by registered mail to the parties.
Notice
13.        .  The rights, benefits and obligations of Constellation under this Agreement shall be transferable, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by or against, its successors and assigns.

The rights and benefits of Executive under this Agreement shall not be transferable other than rights to property or compensation that may pass on his death to his estate or beneficiaries through his will or the laws of descent and distribution and the terms of any Constellation compensation or benefit plan.
Transferability
14.        .

This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the employment of Executive by Constellation and upon execution of this Agreement supersedes any previous agreement. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless evidenced by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any provision or conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time.

8.         .
Restrictive Covenant
(a)           Executive agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) provided that Executive is entitled to the payment under Section 6(b) or is terminated due to a For Cause Termination, for a period of two (2) years after he ceases employment, he will not, without the written consent of Constellation, seek or obtain a position with a Competitor (as defined below) in which Executive will use or is likely to use any confidential information or trade secrets of Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation, or in which Executive has duties for such Competitor that involve Competitive Services (as defined below) and that are the same or similar to those services actually performed by Executive for Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation.  The parties agree that Executive may continue service on any boards of directors on which he is serving while employed by Constellation or its affiliates.  If Executives employment is terminated by Executive for a Good Reason Termination or by Constellation for any reason other than a For Cause Termination, then Constellation will not unreasonably withhold such consent provided Constellation receives information and assurances, satisfactory to Constellation, regarding Executives new position.
(b)           Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between Constellation and its affiliates and each of their respective employees constitutes a valuable asset of Constellation and its affiliates and may not be converted to Executives own use.  Accordingly, Executive hereby agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) for a period of twelve months (12) months after he ceases employment, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of another person, solicit or induce any employee to terminate his or her employment relationship with Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation or to enter into employment with another person.  The foregoing shall not apply to employees who respond to solicitations of employment directed to the general public or who seek employment at their own initiative.
(c)           For the purposes of this Section 8, Competitive Services means the provision of goods or services that are competitive with any goods or services offered by Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation including, but not limited to manufacturing, importing, exporting, distributing or selling wine, beer, liquor or other alcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.  The parties acknowledge that Constellation or its affiliates may from time to time during the term of this Agreement change or increase the line of goods or services it provides and its geographic markets, and Executive agrees that this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended from time to time to include such different or additional goods, services, and geographic markets to the definition of Competitive Services for purposes of this Section 8.  Competitor means any individual or any entity or enterprise engaged, wholly or in part, in Competitive Services.
(d)           Executive agrees that, due to his position of trust and confidence, the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable, and the benefits conferred on him in this Agreement, including his compensation, are adequate consideration, and, since the
 
- 5 -
 
nature of Constellations and its affiliates collective business is international in scope, the geographic restriction herein is reasonable.
(e)           Executive acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will cause irreparable injury and damage, which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, he acknowledges that the remedies of injunction and specific performance shall be available in the event of such a breach, and Constellation shall be entitled to money damages, costs and attorneys fees, and other legal or equitable remedies, including an injunction pending trial, without the posting of bond or other security. Any period of restriction set forth in this Section 8 shall be extended for a period of time equal to the duration of any breach or violation thereof.
(f)           In the event of Executives breach of this Section 8, in addition to the injunctive relief described above, Constellations remedy shall include (i) the right to require Executive to account for and pay over to Constellation all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Executive as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the restrictive covenants in this Section 8, and (ii) in the case of a breach during the term of Executives employment hereunder, the termination of all compensation otherwise payable to Executive under Sections 3 and 4 with respect to the period of time after such breach, or (iii) in the case of a breach during the period described in Section 8(a)(ii) or 8(b)(ii) above, the forfeiture to Constellation of any payment made under Sections 6(b) herein.
(g)           In the event that any provision of this Section 8 is held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction, then the court so holding may modify the terms thereof, including the period of time during which it operates or the geographic area to which it applies, or effect any other change to the extent necessary to render this Section 8 enforceable, it being acknowledged by the parties that the representations and covenants set forth herein are of the essence of this Agreement.
9.         .
Certain Additional Payments by Constellation
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9 (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or similar section (provided that Section 409A shall not be treated as a similar section), or any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment
 
- 6 -
 
equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  It is the intention of the parties that Constellation provide Executive with a full tax gross-up under the provisions of this Section 9(a) so that on a net after-tax basis, the result to Executive shall be the same as if the Excise Tax had not been imposed on a Payment.
(b)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 9 (including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination) shall be made by the nationally recognized accounting firm serving as Constellations independent accounting firm (the Accounting Firm).  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both Constellation and Executive within 20 business days of Constellations receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a Payment or at such earlier time as is requested by Constellation.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control, Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Constellation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to Section 9(a), shall be paid by Constellation to Executive within 10 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Constellation and Executive.  The above provisions of this paragraph (b) notwithstanding, payments due to Executive under this Section 9 shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive remits such excise tax or such earlier date as may be required to comply with Section 409A.
(c)           As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by Constellation should have been made (the Underpayment) or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made that should not have been made (Overpayments), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive.  If the Accounting Firm shall determine that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall promptly repay the amount of the Overpayment to Constellation.
10.        .  Executive agrees that unless duly authorized in writing by Constellation, he will neither during his employment by Constellation or its affiliates nor at any time thereafter divulge or use in connection with any business activity other than that of Constellation or its affiliates any trade secrets or confidential information first acquired by him during and by virtue of his employment with Constellation or its affiliates.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
11.        .  Constellation and its successors and/or assigns will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Executive to the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of
Indemnification
 
- 7 -
 
Delaware and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Constellation as in effect on the date of this Agreement with respect to any claims that may be brought against Executive arising out of any action taken or not taken by Executive in his capacity as an employee, officer or director of Constellation.  In addition, Constellation will advance to Executive reasonable legal fees and expenses, as such fees and expenses are incurred by Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject only to any requirements as are imposed by law.  Executive shall not unreasonably withhold his consent to the settlement of any claim for monetary damages for which Executive is entitled to full indemnification hereunder.  Executive shall be covered, in respect of his activities as an officer or director of Constellation, by any Directors and Officers liability policy or other similar policies maintained or obtained by Constellation or any of its successors and/or assigns to the fullest extent permitted by such policies.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Executives rights under this Section 11 shall survive the Termination Date and the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall continue without limit for so long as Executive may be subject to any claims covered by this Section 11.  No amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Constellation after the date of this Agreement will affect or impair Executives rights under this Section 11 even with respect to any action taken or not taken by Executive after the effective date of any such amendment.
12.       .  Any and all notices referred to herein shall be sufficient if furnished in writing and sent by registered mail to the parties.
Notice
13.       .  The rights, benefits and obligations of Constellation under this Agreement shall be transferable, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by or against, its successors and assigns.  Whenever the term Constellation is used in this Agreement, such term shall mean and include Constellation Brands, Inc. and its successors and assigns.  The rights and benefits of Executive under this Agreement shall not be transferable other than rights to property or compensation that may pass on his death to his estate or beneficiaries through his will or the laws of descent and distribution and the terms of any Constellation compensation or benefit plan.
Transferability
14.       .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability thereof shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are to be severable.
Severability
15.       .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the employment of Executive by Constellation and upon execution of this Agreement supersedes any previous agreement.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless evidenced by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any provision or conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time.
Amendment; Waiver
16.       .  Constellation may withhold from any payments due to Executive hereunder such amounts as Constellation may determine are required to be withheld
Tax Withholding
 
- 8 -
 
under applicable federal, state and local tax laws.  To the extent that there are no cash payments to withhold upon, Executive shall promptly remit to Constellation cash payments that are sufficient to cover all applicable withholdings.
17.       .  The parties intend this Agreement to be governed by and subject to the requirements of Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the intent that Executive not be subject to tax under Section 409A (to the extent such rules are applicable to payments or benefits under this Agreement).  If any provision of the Agreement would otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the conflict.  Constellation shall not be responsible for any tax, penalty, interest or similar assessment imposed on Executive as a consequence of Section 409A.
Section 409A
18.       .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

Exhibit 99.3
 
EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made as of May 21, 2008 between Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Constellation), and Jose Fernandez (Executive).
Executive has contributed substantially to the growth and success of Constellation.  Accordingly, Constellation desires to retain Executives services as set forth in the Agreement and to provide the necessary consideration to assure such services.
Constellation and Executive therefore agree as follows:
1.         .  Constellation hereby employs Executive as its Chief Executive Officer, Constellation Wines North America or in such other senior executive position with Constellation or its affiliates as Constellation and Executive shall mutually agree upon.  Executive hereby accepts the employment specified herein, agrees to perform, in good faith, the duties, consistent with his position, to abide by the terms and conditions described in this Agreement and to devote his full working time and best efforts to Constellation and its affiliates.  These obligations shall not restrict Executive from engaging in customary activities as a director or trustee of other business or not-for-profit organizations so long as such activities, in the reasonable opinion of Constellation or its Board of Directors, do not materially interfere with the performance of Executives responsibilities under this Agreement or create a real or apparent conflict of interests.
Employment
2.         .  The term of employment under this Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above and shall expire on February 28, 2011, provided that on February 28, 2011, and on each subsequent anniversary thereof, the term shall automatically be extended by the parties for an additional one-year period, until Constellation gives Executive notice, not less than 180 days prior to February 28, 2011, or an anniversary thereof, of a decision not to extend the Agreement for an additional one-year period.
Term of Employment
3.         .
Compensation
(a)           During the term of Executives employment, Constellation shall pay him a base salary at the rate of $669,500 per annum or such greater amount as the Human Resources Committee of the Board shall determine (Base Salary).  Such Base Salary shall be payable in accordance with Constellations standard payroll practices for senior executives.  Constellation may pay Executive a bonus in such amount and at such time or times as the Human Resources Committee of the Board shall determine.
(b)           For so long as Constellation continues to require you to operate out of two primary business locations (i.e., California and New York State), Constellation will provide during your period of employment, in addition to your Base Salary, either (i) in the case you own homes in both locations, a $3,000 monthly allowance to assist in defraying the costs of maintaining two households and the use of a second leased vehicle or (ii) if you own a home in only one location, reasonable housing, rental of associated
 
 
furnishings, coverage of utilities and maintenance, and use of a second leased vehicle at the other location as well as reimbursement of reasonable travel for your spouse.  For this period of time, Constellation will also provide you with reasonable personal income tax preparation services by a provider to be selected by Constellation.  Executive, however, will be responsible for all personal income taxes associated with any of the above-described monthly allowance payments, in-kind benefits and reimbursements.
4.         .  Executive shall be expected to incur various reasonable business expenses customarily incurred by persons holding like positions, including but not limited to traveling, entertainment and similar expenses incurred for the benefit of Constellation.  Constellation shall reimburse Executive for such expenses from time to time, at Executives request, and Executive shall account to Constellation for such expenses.

8.         .
Restrictive Covenant
(a)           Executive agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) provided that Executive is entitled to the payment under Section 6(b) or is terminated due to a For Cause Termination, for a period of two (2) years after he ceases employment, he will not, without the written consent of Constellation, seek or obtain a position with a Competitor (as defined below) in which Executive will use or is likely to use any confidential information or trade secrets of Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation, or in which Executive has duties for such Competitor that involve Competitive Services (as defined below) and that are the same or similar to those services actually performed by Executive for Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation.  The parties agree that Executive may continue service on any boards of directors on which he is serving while employed by Constellation or its affiliates.  If Executives employment is terminated by Executive for a Good Reason Termination or by Constellation for any reason other than a For Cause Termination, then Constellation will not unreasonably withhold such consent provided Constellation receives information and assurances, satisfactory to Constellation, regarding Executives new position.
(b)           Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between Constellation and its affiliates and each of their respective employees constitutes a valuable asset of Constellation and its affiliates and may not be converted to Executives own use.  Accordingly, Executive hereby agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) for a period of twelve months (12) months after he ceases employment, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of another person, solicit or induce any employee to terminate his or her employment relationship with Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation or to enter into employment with another person.  The foregoing shall not apply to employees who respond to solicitations of employment directed to the general public or who seek employment at their own initiative.
 
- 5 -
(c)           For the purposes of this Section 8, Competitive Services means the provision of goods or services that are competitive with any goods or services offered by Constellation or any affiliate of Constellation including, but not limited to manufacturing, importing, exporting, distributing or selling wine, beer, liquor or other alcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.  The parties acknowledge that Constellation or its affiliates may from time to time during the term of this Agreement change or increase the line of goods or services it provides and its geographic markets, and Executive agrees that this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended from time to time to include such different or additional goods, services, and geographic markets to the definition of Competitive Services for purposes of this Section 8.  Competitor means any individual or any entity or enterprise engaged, wholly or in part, in Competitive Services.
(d)           Executive agrees that, due to his position of trust and confidence, the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable, and the benefits conferred on him in this Agreement, including his compensation, are adequate consideration, and, since the nature of Constellations and its affiliates collective business is international in scope, the geographic restriction herein is reasonable.
(e)           Executive acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will cause irreparable injury and damage, which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, he acknowledges that the remedies of injunction and specific performance shall be available in the event of such a breach, and Constellation shall be entitled to money damages, costs and attorneys fees, and other legal or equitable remedies, including an injunction pending trial, without the posting of bond or other security. Any period of restriction set forth in this Section 8 shall be extended for a period of time equal to the duration of any breach or violation thereof.
(f)           In the event of Executives breach of this Section 8, in addition to the injunctive relief described above, Constellations remedy shall include (i) the right to require Executive to account for and pay over to Constellation all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Executive as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the restrictive covenants in this Section 8, and (ii) in the case of a breach during the term of Executives employment hereunder, the termination of all compensation otherwise payable to Executive under Sections 3 and 4 with respect to the period of time after such breach, or (iii) in the case of a breach during the period described in Section 8(a)(ii) or 8(b)(ii) above, the forfeiture to Constellation of any payment made under Sections 6(b) herein.
(g)           In the event that any provision of this Section 8 is held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction, then the court so holding may modify the terms thereof, including the period of time during which it operates or the geographic area to which it applies, or effect any other change to the extent necessary to render this Section 8 enforceable, it being acknowledged by the parties that the representations and covenants set forth herein are of the essence of this Agreement.

9.         .
Certain Additional Payments by Constellation
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section 9 (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or similar section (provided that Section 409A shall not be treated as a similar section), or any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  It is the intention of the parties that Constellation provide Executive with a full tax gross-up under the provisions of this Section 9(a) so that on a net after-tax basis, the result to Executive shall be the same as if the Excise Tax had not been imposed on a Payment.
(b)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 9 (including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination) shall be made by the nationally recognized accounting firm serving as Constellations independent accounting firm (the Accounting Firm).  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both Constellation and Executive within 20 business days of Constellations receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a Payment or at such earlier time as is requested by Constellation.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control, Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Constellation. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to Section 9(a), shall be paid by Constellation to Executive within 10 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Constellation and Executive.  The above provisions of this paragraph (b) notwithstanding, payments due to Executive under this Section 9 shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive remits such excise tax or such earlier date as may be required to comply with Section 409A.
(c)           As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by Constellation should have been made (the Underpayment) or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made
 
- 7 -
 
that should not have been made (Overpayments), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive.  If the Accounting Firm shall determine that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall promptly repay the amount of the Overpayment to Constellation.
10.       .  Executive agrees that unless duly authorized in writing by Constellation, he will neither during his employment by Constellation or its affiliates nor at any time thereafter divulge or use in connection with any business activity other than that of Constellation or its affiliates any trade secrets or confidential information first acquired by him during and by virtue of his employment with Constellation or its affiliates.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
11.       .  Constellation and its successors and/or assigns will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Executive to the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of Delaware and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Constellation as in effect on the date of this Agreement with respect to any claims that may be brought against Executive arising out of any action taken or not taken by Executive in his capacity as an employee, officer or director of Constellation.  In addition, Constellation will advance to Executive reasonable legal fees and expenses, as such fees and expenses are incurred by Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject only to any requirements as are imposed by law.  Executive shall not unreasonably withhold his consent to the settlement of any claim for monetary damages for which Executive is entitled to full indemnification hereunder.  Executive shall be covered, in respect of his activities as an officer or director of Constellation, by any Directors and Officers liability policy or other similar policies maintained or obtained by Constellation or any of its successors and/or assigns to the fullest extent permitted by such policies.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Executives rights under this Section 11 shall survive the Termination Date and the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall continue without limit for so long as Executive may be subject to any claims covered by this Section 11.  No amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Constellation after the date of this Agreement will affect or impair Executives rights under this Section 11 even with respect to any action taken or not taken by Executive after the effective date of any such amendment.
Indemnification
12.       .  Any and all notices referred to herein shall be sufficient if furnished in writing and sent by registered mail to the parties.
Notice
13.       .  The rights, benefits and obligations of Constellation under this Agreement shall be transferable, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by or against, its successors and assigns.  Whenever the term Constellation is used in this Agreement, such term shall mean and include Constellation Brands, Inc. and its successors and assigns.  The rights and benefits of Executive under this Agreement shall not be transferable other than rights to property or compensation that may pass on his death to his estate or beneficiaries through his will or the laws of descent and distribution and the terms of any Constellation compensation or benefit plan.
Transferability
 
- 8 -
 
14.       .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability thereof shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are to be severable.
Severability
15.       .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the employment of Executive by Constellation and upon execution of this Agreement supersedes any previous agreement.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless evidenced by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.  No waiver by either party of any breach by the other party of any provision or conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time.
Amendment; Waiver
16.       .  Constellation may withhold from any payments due to Executive hereunder such amounts as Constellation may determine are required to be withheld under applicable federal, state and local tax laws.  To the extent that there are no cash payments to withhold upon, Executive shall promptly remit to Constellation cash payments that are sufficient to cover all applicable withholdings.
Tax Withholding
17.       .  The parties intend this Agreement to be governed by and subject to the requirements of Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the intent that Executive not be subject to tax under Section 409A (to the extent such rules are applicable to payments or benefits under this Agreement).  If any provision of the Agreement would otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the conflict.  Constellation shall not be responsible for any tax, penalty, interest or similar assessment imposed on Executive as a consequence of Section 409A.
Section 409A
18.       .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

Executive has contributed substantially to the growth and success of Barton, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation.  Accordingly, Barton and Constellation desire to retain Executives services as set forth in the Agreement and to provide the necessary consideration to assure such services.
Barton and Executive therefore agree as follows:
1.          .  Barton hereby employs Executive as its President and Chief Executive Officer or in such other senior executive position as Barton or Constellation and Executive shall mutually agree upon.  Executive hereby accepts the employment specified herein, agrees to perform, in good faith, the duties, consistent with his position, to abide by the terms and conditions described in this Agreement and to devote his full working time and best efforts to Barton and its affiliates.  (As used in this Agreement, the phrases Barton and its affiliates and Barton or any affiliate of Barton shall include Constellation and its affiliates.)  These obligations shall not restrict Executive from engaging in customary activities as a director or trustee of other business or not-for-profit organizations so long as such activities, in the reasonable opinion of Constellation or its Board of Directors, do not materially interfere with the performance of Executives responsibilities under this Agreement or create a real or apparent conflict of interests.
Employment
2.          .  The term of employment under this Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above and shall expire on February 28, 2011, provided that on February 28, 2011, and on each subsequent anniversary thereof, the term shall automatically be extended by the parties for an additional one-year period, until Barton gives Executive notice, not less than 180 days prior to February 28, 2011, or an anniversary thereof, of a decision not to extend the Agreement for an additional one-year period.
Term of Employment
3.          .  During the term of Executives employment, Barton shall pay him a base salary at the rate of $651,460 per annum or such greater amount as the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Constellation shall determine (Base Salary).  Such Base Salary shall be payable in accordance with Bartons standard payroll practices for senior executives.  Barton may pay Executive a bonus in such amount and at such time or times as the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Constellation shall determine.  (Executive and Barton acknowledge that, for so long as Executive serves as an executive officer of the Company, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Constellation is responsible for annually reviewing and, as appropriate, approving or recommending that the Board of Constellation approve each element of Executives compensation, including salary, bonus, benefits and perquisites.)
Compensation
 
4.          .  Executive shall be expected to incur various reasonable business expenses customarily incurred by persons holding like positions, including but not limited to traveling, entertainment and similar expenses incurred for the benefit of Barton or Constellation.  Barton shall reimburse Executive for such expenses from time to time, at Executives request, and Executive shall account to Barton for such expenses.  Executive shall participate in such benefit plans that are generally made available to all executives of Constellation.

8.         .
Restrictive Covenant
(a)           Executive agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) provided that Executive is entitled to the payment under Section 6(b) or is terminated due to a For Cause Termination, for a period of two (2) years after he ceases employment, he will not, without the written consent of Barton and Constellation, seek or obtain a position with a Competitor (as defined below) in which Executive will use or is likely to use any confidential information or trade secrets of Barton or its affiliates, or in which Executive has duties for such Competitor that involve Competitive Services (as defined below) and that are the same or similar to those services actually performed by Executive for Barton or its affiliates.  The parties agree that Executive may continue service on any boards of directors on which he is serving while employed by Barton or its affiliates.  If Executives employment is terminated by Executive for a Good Reason Termination or by Barton or Constellation for any reason other than a For Cause Termination, then neither Barton nor Constellation will unreasonably withhold such consent provided each of them receive information and assurances, satisfactory to each of them, regarding Executives new position.
(b)           Executive understands and agrees that the relationship between Barton and its affiliates and each of their respective employees constitutes a valuable asset of Barton and its affiliates and may not be converted to Executives own use.  Accordingly, Executive hereby agrees that (i) during the period of his employment hereunder and (ii) for a period of twelve months (12) months after he ceases employment, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on behalf of another person, solicit or induce any employee to terminate his or her employment relationship with Barton or any affiliate of Barton or to enter into employment with another person.  The foregoing shall not apply to employees who respond to solicitations of employment directed to the general public or who seek employment at their own initiative.
(c)           For the purposes of this Section 8, Competitive Services means the provision of goods or services that are competitive with any goods or services offered by Barton or its affiliates including, but not limited to manufacturing, importing, exporting, distributing or selling wine, beer, liquor or other alcoholic beverages in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.  The parties acknowledge that Barton or its affiliates may from time to time during the term of this Agreement change
 
- 5 -
 
or increase the line of goods or services they provide and their geographic markets, and Executive agrees that this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended from time to time to include such different or additional goods, services, and geographic markets to the definition of Competitive Services for purposes of this Section 8.  Competitor means any individual or any entity or enterprise engaged, wholly or in part, in Competitive Services.
(d)           Executive agrees that, due to his position of trust and confidence, the restrictions contained in this Section 8 are reasonable, and the benefits conferred on him in this Agreement, including his compensation, are adequate consideration, and, since the nature of Bartons and its affiliates collective business is international in scope, the geographic restriction herein is reasonable.
(e)           Executive acknowledges that a breach of this Section 8 will cause irreparable injury and damage, which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by money damages. Accordingly, he acknowledges that the remedies of injunction and specific performance shall be available in the event of such a breach, and Barton and Constellation shall be entitled to money damages, costs and attorneys fees, and other legal or equitable remedies, including an injunction pending trial, without the posting of bond or other security. Any period of restriction set forth in this Section 8 shall be extended for a period of time equal to the duration of any breach or violation thereof.
(f)           In the event of Executives breach of this Section 8, in addition to the injunctive relief described above, Bartons and Constellations remedy shall include (i) the right to require Executive to account for and pay over to Barton or Constellation all compensation, profits, monies, accruals, increments or other benefits derived or received by Executive as the result of any transactions constituting a breach of the restrictive covenants in this Section 8, and (ii) in the case of a breach during the term of Executives employment hereunder, the termination of all compensation otherwise payable to Executive under Sections 3 and 4 with respect to the period of time after such breach, or (iii) in the case of a breach during the period described in Section 8(a)(ii) or 8(b)(ii) above, the forfeiture to Barton of any payment made under Sections 6(b) herein.
(g)           In the event that any provision of this Section 8 is held to be in any respect an unreasonable restriction, then the court so holding may modify the terms thereof, including the period of time during which it operates or the geographic area to which it applies, or effect any other change to the extent necessary to render this Section 8 enforceable, it being acknowledged by the parties that the representations and covenants set forth herein are of the essence of this Agreement.
9.         .
Certain Additional Payments by Constellation
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and except as set forth below, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Barton or Constellation to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to
 
- 6 -
 
any additional payments required under this Section 9 (a Payment) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or similar section (provided that Section 409A shall not be treated as a similar section), or any interest or penalties are incurred by Executive with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Excise Tax), then Barton shall pay Executive an additional payment (a Gross-Up Payment) in an amount such that after payment by Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with respect thereto) and any Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.  It is the intention of the parties that Barton provide Executive with a full tax gross-up under the provisions of this Section 9(a) so that on a net after-tax basis, the result to Executive shall be the same as if the Excise Tax had not been imposed on a Payment.
(b)           All determinations required to be made under this Section 9 (including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required, the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination) shall be made by the nationally recognized accounting firm serving as Constellations independent accounting firm (the Accounting Firm).  The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both Barton and Executive within 20 business days of Bartons receipt of notice from Executive that there has been a Payment or at such earlier time as is requested by Barton.  In the event that the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in control, Executive may appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by Barton.  Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to Section 9(a), shall be paid by Barton to Executive within 10 days of the receipt of the Accounting Firms determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Barton and Executive.  The above provisions of this paragraph (b) notwithstanding, payments due to Executive under this Section 9 shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive remits such excise tax or such earlier date as may be required to comply with Section 409A.
(c)           As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments that will not have been made by Barton should have been made (the Underpayment) or that Gross-Up Payments will have been made that should not have been made (Overpayments), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Barton to or for the benefit of Executive.  If the Accounting Firm shall determine that an Overpayment has been made, Executive shall promptly repay the amount of the Overpayment to Barton.
 
- 7 -
10.       .  Executive agrees that unless duly authorized in writing by Barton, he will neither during his employment by Barton or its affiliates nor at any time thereafter divulge or use in connection with any business activity other than that of Barton or its affiliates any trade secrets or confidential information first acquired by him during and by virtue of his employment with Barton or its affiliates.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information
11.       .  Constellation and its successors and/or assigns will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Executive to the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of Delaware and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of Constellation as in effect on the date of this Agreement with respect to any claims that may be brought against Executive arising out of any action taken or not taken by Executive in his capacity as an employee, officer or director of Barton or Constellation.  In addition, Constellation will advance to Executive reasonable legal fees and expenses, as such fees and expenses are incurred by Executive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, subject only to any requirements as are imposed by law.  Executive shall not unreasonably withhold his consent to the settlement of any claim for monetary damages for which Executive is entitled to full indemnification hereunder.  Executive shall be covered, in respect of his activities as an officer or director of Barton or Constellation, by any Directors and Officers liability policy or other similar policies maintained or obtained by Constellation or any of its successors and/or assigns to the fullest extent permitted by such policies.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Executives rights under this Section 11 shall survive the Termination Date and the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall continue without limit for so long as Executive may be subject to any claims covered by this Section 11.  No amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Constellation after the date of this Agreement will affect or impair Executives rights under this Section 11 even with respect to any action taken or not taken by Executive after the effective date of any such amendment.
Indemnification
12.       .  Any and all notices referred to herein shall be sufficient if furnished in writing and sent by registered mail to the parties.
Notice
13.       .  The rights, benefits and obligations of Barton or Constellation under this Agreement shall be transferable, and all covenants and agreements hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by or against, its successors and assigns.  Whenever the term Barton is used in this Agreement, such term shall mean and include Barton Incorporated and its successors and assigns.  Whenever the term Constellation is used in this Agreement, such term shall mean and include Constellation Brands, Inc. and its successors and assigns.  The rights and benefits of Executive under this Agreement shall not be transferable other than rights to property or compensation that may pass on his death to his estate or beneficiaries through his will or the laws of descent and distribution and the terms of any Barton or Constellation compensation or benefit plan.
Transferability
14.       .  If any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability thereof shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision, and to this end the provisions of this Agreement are to be severable.
Severability
 
- 8 -
15.       .  This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the employment of Executive by Barton and upon execution of this Agreement supersedes any previous agreement. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid unless evidenced by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto.  No waiver by any party of any breach by another party of any provision or conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time.
Amendment; Waiver
16.       . Barton and Constellation may withhold from any payments due to Executive hereunder such amounts as Barton or Constellation may determine are required to be withheld under applicable federal, state and local tax laws.  To the extent that there are no cash payments to withhold upon, Executive shall promptly remit to Barton or Constellation, as appropriate, cash payments that are sufficient to cover all applicable withholdings.
Tax Withholding
17.       .  The parties intend this Agreement to be governed by and subject to the requirements of Section 409A, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the intent that Executive not be subject to tax under Section 409A (to the extent such rules are applicable to payments or benefits under this Agreement).  If any provision of the Agreement would otherwise conflict with or frustrate this intent, that provision will be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid the conflict.  Neither Barton nor Constellation shall be responsible for any tax, penalty, interest or similar assessment imposed on Executive as a consequence of Section 409A.
Section 409A
18.       .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
