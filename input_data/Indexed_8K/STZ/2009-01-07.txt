The release contains non-GAAP financial measures; in the release these are referred to as comparable, organic or constant currency measures.  For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrants historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.  In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Comparable measures and organic net sales measures are provided because management uses this information in evaluating the results of the continuing operations of the Company and/or in internal goal setting.  In addition, the Company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.

The Company acquired the SVEDKA Vodka brand and related business on March 19, 2007 and acquired Beam Wine Estates, Inc. (BWE) on December 17, 2007.  In addition, the Company formed the Matthew Clark joint venture effective April 17, 2007; divested the Almaden and Inglenook branded wines effective February 28, 2008 and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; and exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008.  Accordingly, during the indicated periods, organic net sales measures exclude the net sales of SVEDKA Vodka, BWE products, the U.K. wholesale business, Almaden and Inglenook branded wine, certain Pacific Northwest wine brands, or certain spirits production contracts, or include the net sales of U.K. branded wine, as appropriate.

NEWS RELEASE
21
 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ, ASX: CBR), the worlds largest wine company and a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol, today reported its fiscal 2009 third quarter results.  We are pleased with our performance especially given the challenging economic conditions that evolved over the course of the year, stated Rob Sands, Constellation Brands president and chief executive officer.  We have significantly improved margins, grown free cash flow, monetized assets and rapidly reduced debt.
FAIRPORT, N.Y., Jan. 7, 2009
 
On a reported basis, the company recorded net income of $84 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter ended Nov. 30, 2008 (third quarter 2009), compared with net income of $120 million or $0.55 diluted EPS for the prior year.
 
Constellations third quarter 2009 net income on a comparable basis, which excludes restructuring charges, acquisition-related integration costs and unusual items, totaled $132 million versus $121 million for the prior year, with $0.60 diluted EPS for the quarter versus $0.55 for the prior year.

Net Sales Commentary
 
Reported consolidated net sales decreased six percent primarily due to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations.  The net sales benefit from the acquisition of the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands was essentially offset by the divestiture of the Almaden, Inglenook and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands, and certain spirits contract production services.  Organic net sales increased one percent on a constant currency basis.
 
The company continues to execute its strategy of implementing price increases and SKU reductions in its key markets.  While these actions have unfavorably impacted volume growth, they have enhanced worldwide wine margins and ROIC.  Branded wine organic net sales on a constant currency basis decreased two percent, which includes a two percent increase for North America, an 11 percent decrease for Europe and a two percent decrease for Australia/New Zealand.
 
We believe that prioritizing profit margin, free cash flow and ROIC is paramount in this environment and, on balance, an appropriate tradeoff, commented Sands.

Total spirits organic net sales increased five percent for the quarter, led by a 60 percent gain for SVEDKA Vodka.
 
As consumers seek quality and value from established brands, mid-premium spirits such as SVEDKA and Black Velvet continue to outperform their respective categories in the marketplace and contribute significantly to our spirits business performance, said Sands.  In particular, SVEDKAs ongoing stellar growth rate illustrates the power of a brand that is connecting with consumers in the U.S. from coast to coast.
 
Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
 
Wines segment operating income increased $20 million versus the prior year quarter.  This increase reflects the benefits of our pricing initiative and the contribution from the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands, partially offset by the divestiture of Almaden, Inglenook and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands.  The repositioning of the companys U.S. portfolio to more premium brands and resulting synergies have positively impacted profit margins.
 
Spirits segment operating income decreased $3 million primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses.
 
Constellations equity earnings from its 50 percent interest in the Crown
Imports joint venture totaled $62 million, which was even with the prior year third quarter.  For third quarter 2009, Crown Imports generated net sales of $555 million, an increase of one percent, and operating income of $124 million, which was flat with the prior year quarter.
 
For third quarter 2009, pre-tax restructuring charges, acquisition-related integration costs and unusual items totaled $21 million compared to $3 million for the prior year quarter.
 
Interest expense decreased five percent from $82 million for third quarter 2008 to $78 million for third quarter 2009.  On a year-to-date basis through November 2008, the company has generated free cash flow of $235 million, compared with $173 million in the prior year.

Due primarily to strong free cash flow, and the proceeds from asset dispositions during the first nine months of fiscal 2009, total borrowings
have decreased by more than $475 million from fiscal year end 2008 levels, while our cash position increased by more than $160 million during the same period, stated Bob Ryder, Constellation Brands chief financial officer.  Subsequent to the third quarter, the company prepaid $195 million in term loans under its senior credit facility.
 
As previously announced, the company expects to realize approximately $50 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the gain on settlement of certain foreign currency economic hedges during fiscal 2009.  The companys third quarter fiscal 2009 reported results reflect an unfavorable $0.15 diluted EPS impact associated with the recognition of income tax expense related to these hedge transactions.
 
Summary
 
Given the current macroeconomic environment impacting our key markets, we are recalibrating our sales expectations while taking appropriate actions to reduce costs and capture the benefits from ongoing debt reduction to better ensure that we will meet our future financial objectives, said Sands.  As a result, the company is tightening its comparable diluted EPS range to $1.68 - $1.72 from the companys previous estimate of $1.68 - $1.76.
 
Outlook

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED, ORGANIC AND CONSTANT CURRENCY NET SALES
(in millions)
As the company formed its U.K. wholesale joint venture on April 17, 2007; acquired BWE on December 17, 2007; sold its Almaden and Inglenook wine brands on February 28, 2008; sold certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; and exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008, organic net sales for the respective periods are defined by the company as reported net sales plus/less net sales of U.K. wholesale, U.K. branded wine, BWE products, Almaden and Inglenook branded wine, Pacific Northwest brands, or contract production services, as appropriate.  As the company acquired Svedka on March 19, 2007, organic net sales for the nine months ended November 30, 2008, have not been adjusted for net sales of Svedka products during the period March 1, 2008, through March 18, 2008, as amounts are not significant.  Organic net sales and percentage increase (decrease) in constant currency net sales (which excludes the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations) are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the company.  In addition, the company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.

Free Cash Flow Guidance
 
Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes.  A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
