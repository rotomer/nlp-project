On April 8, 2009, Constellation Brands, Inc. (the Company), a Delaware corporation, issued a news release (the release) announcing its financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.  A copy of the release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.  The projections constituting the guidance included in the release involve risks and uncertainties, the outcome of which cannot be foreseen at this time and, therefore, actual results may vary materially from these forecasts.  In this regard, see the information included in the release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements.
 
The information in the release is furnished and not filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.  Such information may be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933 only if and to the extent such subsequent filing specifically references the information incorporated by reference herein.
The release contains non-GAAP financial measures; in the release these are referred to as comparable, organic or constant currency measures.  For purposes of Regulation G, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrants historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows (or equivalent statements) of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.  In this regard, GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations within the release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Comparable measures, organic net sales measures and constant currency measures are provided because management uses this information in evaluating the results of the continuing operations of the Company and/or in internal goal setting.  In addition, the Company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.  As such, the following items, when appropriate, are excluded from comparable results:  the flow through of adverse grape cost associated with an acquisition; the flow through of inventory step-up associated with acquisitions and investments in equity method investees; accelerated depreciation in connection with certain restructuring activities; the write-down of inventory in connection with certain restructuring and/or integration activities, the disposal of a business and other items; other costs incurred in connection with certain restructuring and/or integration activities; the loss on disposal in connection with the Companys contribution of its U.K. wholesale business to the Matthew Clark joint venture and the provision for income taxes in connection with the repatriation of proceeds associated with this transaction; losses in connection with the disposal of a business and/or assets, including assets held for sale; realized gain on a prior asset sale; the write-off of certain property, plant and equipment; impairments of certain goodwill and intangible assets; restructuring charges; acquisition-related integration costs; impairments of certain equity method investments; the recognition of income tax expense in connection with the gain on settlement of certain foreign currency economic hedges; a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards in Australia; and a tax benefit related to prior period stock option exercises.  The Company acquired the SVEDKA Vodka brand and related business on March 19, 2007 and acquired Beam Wine Estates, Inc. (BWE) on December 17, 2007.  In addition, the Company formed the Matthew Clark joint venture effective April 17, 2007; divested the Almaden and Inglenook branded wines effective February 28, 2008 and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; and exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008.  Accordingly, during the indicated periods, organic net sales measures exclude the net sales of SVEDKA Vodka, BWE products, the U.K. wholesale business, Almaden and Inglenook branded wine, certain Pacific Northwest wine brands, or certain spirits production contracts, or include the net sales of U.K. branded wine, as appropriate.  Constant currency measures exclude the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations.
 
 
 
 
 
On an ongoing basis, Constellation Brands, Inc. (the Company) seeks to maximize asset utilization, reduce costs and improve long-term return on invested capital throughout its operations.  In connection with these efforts, the Company has conducted a strategic review of its global business and, on April 7, 2009, committed to the principal features of a plan, the Global Initiative, to simplify its business, increase efficiencies and reduce its cost structure on a global basis.  The Company expects these actions will result in the elimination of approximately five percent of its global workforce and the closure of certain office, production and warehouse facilities.  In addition to the costs associated with the elimination of employee positions, the Global Initiative includes the termination of certain contracts, and a streamlining of the Companys production footprint and sales and administrative organizations. In addition, during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2010 , the Company initiated other non-material restructuring activities primarily in connection with the consolidation of the Companys remaining spirits business into its North American operations following the recent disposition of its value spirits business.  Such non-material activities are included collectively with the information provided with respect to the Global Initiative.  The Company currently expects the Global Initiative to be substantially complete by the end of the Companys fiscal year 2011 which ends on February 28, 2011 .
(Fiscal 2010)
(Fiscal 2011)
 
As further detailed in the table below, the Company expects to incur approximately $51 million of total restructuring charges in connection with the Global Initiative and approximately $32 million of other related costs, all of which charges and costs are expected to be recorded in the Companys results of operations during Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011.  Additionally, the Company expects to record accelerated depreciation of approximately $29 million for expected disposals of certain property, plant and equipment during Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011.  In connection with the Global Initiative, the Company expects to incur aggregate cash charges of approximately $83 million during Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011, and an aggregate of approximately $29 million of non-cash charges during Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2011.  The following table sets forth the Companys current expectations regarding the Global Initiative:
 
The Company estimates that actual employee termination costs could range from $20 million to $30 million depending on the final implementation of the Global Initiative.

The Company may incur additional contract termination costs of up to $10 million as a result of the outcome of the negotiation of certain contract exits.

NEWS RELEASE

 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ, ASX: CBR), the worlds largest wine company, reported today its fiscal 2009 results and fiscal 2010 outlook.  Throughout fiscal 2009, we made great strides
VICTOR, N.Y., April 8, 2009
in a number of key areas including strong free cash flow generation, reducing
borrowings, creating internal efficiencies and transforming our product portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer of Constellation Brands. I am pleased with these accomplishments especially during a time of global economic recession.

Fiscal 2009 Net Sales Highlights*

Fiscal 2009 Net Sales Commentary
Organic net sales increased four percent on a constant currency basis. Reported consolidated net sales decreased three percent due primarily to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuation. The net sales benefit from the acquisition of the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands was more than offset by the divestitures of the Almaden, Inglenook and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands and the impact of reporting the Matthew Clark joint venture under the equity method.
Branded wine organic net sales on a constant currency basis increased three percent, which includes an eight percent increase for North America, a nine percent decrease for Europe, and three percent decrease for Australia/New Zealand. Sales performance in North America reflects solid growth in Canada and the benefit of overlapping the companys initiative to reduce distributor wine inventory levels in the U.S., which negatively impacted net sales in fiscal 2008. Volume growth in key markets was impacted by challenging economic conditions coupled with the implementation of price increases and planned SKU reductions. These price increases and SKU reductions resulted in the expected benefit of
enhanced worldwide wine margins.

During the course of the year, we made significant progress toward premiumizing our product portfolio and will continue our efforts to leverage large, consumer-preferred brands that return the greatest profits, Sands said. We have some of the strongest and most recognized brands in the industry.  Brands like Robert Mondavi, Wild Horse, Ravenswood, Estancia, Clos du Bois and Simi have performed well in the marketplace as consumers in this environment are turning to trusted products that represent quality and good value.
Total spirits organic net sales increased six percent for the year, led by a 50 percent gain for SVEDKA Vodka and solid performance of Black Velvet Canadian Whisky. We are experiencing positive performance from our retained spirits brands and are very pleased that according to market data, SVEDKA has become the fastest growing major spirits brand in the world and the third largest imported vodka in the U.S., said Sands.  SVEDKAs price point and unique marketing approach resonates with consumers who enjoy the products high-end image, quality and value.
Fiscal 2009 Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
Wines segment operating income increased $63 million versus the prior year.  This increase reflects the contribution from the Clos du Bois and Wild Horse brands, the overlap of the U.S. distributor wine inventory reduction initiative and benefits from price increases, partially offset by the divestitures of the Almaden, Inglenook and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands and a decrease in international business performance. The repositioning of the companys U.S. portfolio to more premium brands and resulting synergies has positively impacted operating profit margins.
Constellations equity earnings from its 50 percent interest in the Crown
Imports joint venture totaled $252 million, a decrease of one percent.  For fiscal 2009, Crown Imports generated net sales of $2.4 billion, which was even with the prior year, and operating income of $504 million, a decrease of one percent.
Crowns imported beer business has also been affected by the macroeconomic climate, said Sands. However, looking toward fiscal 2010,
Crown is building momentum for its key spring and summer selling season by putting in place a number of new promotional activities targeted to key locations around the U.S.

For fiscal 2009, pre-tax restructuring charges, acquisition-related integration costs and unusual items totaled $658 million compared to $918 million for the prior year.  During the fourth quarter fiscal 2009, the company recorded an estimated $358 million of non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets and equity method investments primarily in connection with the companys annual impairment testing of its international businesses.
Subsequent to the March 25 fourth quarter earnings preannouncement, the company recorded a non-cash inventory adjustment related primarily to prior years at the company's Australian subsidiary which negatively impacted fiscal 2009 reported basis diluted loss per share.
Interest expense totaled $316 million, a decrease of seven percent. The decrease was primarily from lower interest rates for the year. The company generated free cash flow of $378 million compared with $376 million in the prior year.
Due primarily to strong free cash flow, and the proceeds from asset dispositions during fiscal 2009, total debt decreased by more than $820 million from fiscal year end 2008 levels, said Bob Ryder, Constellation Brands chief financial officer. By the end of fiscal 2009, we prepaid all of our term loan payment requirements under our senior credit facility for fiscal 2010 and a portion for fiscal 2011. Additionally, the $210 million of after-tax proceeds from the recently completed sale of the value spirits business further enhances our deleveraging efforts and will bring our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio to almost four times.
For fiscal 2010, the company is targeting free cash flow in the range of $230 - $270 million. The decrease from fiscal 2009 is expected to be primarily driven by higher taxes paid including a $65 million tax payment related to the sale of the value spirits business in fiscal 2010, approximately $55 million in
favorable hedge transaction settlements received in fiscal 2009 that are not
expected to reoccur and higher capital expenditures.

Fourth Quarter 2009 Financial Highlights*
(in millions, except per share data)
Fourth Quarter 2009 Net Sales Highlights*
(in millions)
Fourth Quarter 2009 Net Sales Commentary
Organic net sales decreased three percent on a constant currency basis. Reported consolidated net sales decreased 17 percent primarily due to the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations and the divestitures of the Almaden, Inglenook, certain Pacific Northwest wine brands and the exit of certain spirits contract production services.
           Branded wine organic net sales on a constant currency basis decreased four percent, which includes a one percent increase for North America, a 16 percent decrease for Europe and a four percent decrease for Australia/New Zealand.   These results reflect the impact of increasingly challenging economic conditions, especially in the U.K. and Australia, price increases and planned SKU reductions.
Turbulent global trading conditions negatively impacted our sales mix in the fourth quarter, which in turn affected our gross profit margins, said Sands. However, we have been able to partially offset these challenges through cost reductions which reflect our flexibility to quickly adapt.
Total spirits organic net sales increased six percent for the quarter, driven by the growth of SVEDKA.

Fourth Quarter 2009 Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
 
Wines segment operating income decreased $39 million versus the prior year quarter.  This decrease primarily reflects the divestitures of the Almaden, Inglenook and certain Pacific Northwest wine brands and a significant decrease in the international business performance.
Constellations equity earnings from its Crown Imports joint venture totaled $47 million, an increase of 13 percent.  For fourth quarter 2009, Crown Imports generated net sales of $434 million, a decrease of six percent, and operating income of $93 million, an increase of 13 percent. The decrease in net sales reflects continuing challenges in the on-premise and convenience channels. Operating income increased due to timing of expenses and cost containment efforts.
For fourth quarter 2009, pre-tax restructuring charges, acquisition-related integration costs and unusual items totaled $468 million compared to $893 million for the prior year quarter.
Interest expense totaled $71 million, a decrease of 24 percent reflecting the benefit of lower average debt balances and interest rates.
Fiscal 2010 Global Initiative
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the company will implement operational changes to simplify the business, increase efficiencies and reduce its cost structure on a global basis. The company expects these actions to result in the elimination of approximately five percent of its global workforce and rationalization of certain facilities. Constellation expects these actions to produce cost savings of approximately $25 million in fiscal 2010 and more than $50 million by the end of fiscal 2011. These savings include synergies from consolidating the retained spirits brands into the North American wine business.
In connection with this global initiative, the company expects to incur one-time cash charges of approximately $83 million and one-time non-cash charges of approximately $29 million, for a total of approximately $112 million, which are summarized below. Approximately $106 million of the total charges are expected to be recognized in fiscal 2010.

  The Company estimates that actual employee termination costs could range from $20 million to $30 million depending on the final implementation of the Global Initiative.

  The Company may incur additional contract termination costs of up to $10 million as a result of the outcome of the negotiation of certain contract exits.

Summary
 
Constellation is focused on the right strategies during these tough economic times to generate cash, pay down debt and increase return on invested capital, said Sands. Given the difficult and uncertain economic conditions, we are cautious with our outlook for fiscal 2010.  However, our business strategy remains intact, we have a clear path forward and plan to be prudent in managing the bottom line by focusing on right-sizing our organization, creating efficiencies and rapidly deleveraging. We believe this strategy, complemented by the strength of our brands, positions the company well to benefit from the inevitable upturn in the economy when it occurs.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED, ORGANIC AND CONSTANT CURRENCY NET SALES
(in millions)
As the company formed its U.K. wholesale joint venture on April 17, 2007; acquired BWE on December 17, 2007; sold its Almaden and Inglenook wine brands on February 28, 2008; sold certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; and exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008, organic net sales for the respective periods are defined by the company as reported net sales plus/less net sales of U.K. wholesale, U.K. branded wine, BWE products, Almaden and Inglenook branded wine, Pacific Northwest brands, or contract production services, as appropriate.  As the company acquired Svedka on March 19, 2007, organic net sales for the year ended February 28, 2009, have not been adjusted for net sales of Svedka products during the period March 1, 2008, through March 18, 2008, as amounts are not significant.  Organic net sales and percentage increase (decrease) in constant currency net sales (which excludes the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations) are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the company.  In addition, the company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.

Free Cash Flow Guidance
 
Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes.  A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
