Comparable measures, organic net sales measures and constant currency measures are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the results and underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the Company and/or in internal goal setting.  In addition, the Company believes this information provides investors a better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.  As such, the following items, including the related income tax effect, are excluded from comparable results, when appropriate:  the flow through of adverse grape cost associated with an acquisition; the flow through of inventory step-up associated with acquisitions; accelerated depreciation in connection with certain restructuring activities; the write-down of inventory in connection with certain restructuring activities; other costs incurred in connection with certain restructuring and/or integration activities; losses in connection with the disposal of a business and/or assets, including assets held for sale; restructuring charges; impairment of intangible assets; acquisition-related integration costs; and the impairment of an equity method investment.  The Company divested certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008; and sold certain value spirits brands on March 24, 2009.  Accordingly, during the indicated period, organic net sales measures exclude the net sales of certain Pacific Northwest wine brands, certain spirits production contracts, and/or certain value spirits brands, as appropriate.  Constant currency measures exclude the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Second Quarter 2010 Financial Highlights*
(in millions, except per share data)

 Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ, ASX: CBR), the worlds leading wine company, reported today its fiscal 2010 second quarter results. "Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that we are on track to achieve our full-year goals," said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer of Constellation Brands. "We are focused on driving organic growth, building must-have brands that return the greatest profits and creating efficiencies for long-term sustainable growth. Our initiative to consolidate distribution in the U.S. is nearly complete and we anticipate that this effort will be a major catalyst for future organic brand growth.

Chief Financial Officer Bob Ryder added, We are pleased with the progress made in our global cost reduction efforts and the continuing drive to increase sustainable free cash flow and pay down debt. Our deleveraging efforts are progressing well as debt decreased by more than $155 million during the second quarter and more than $1 billion since the beginning of fiscal 2009.

Net Sales Commentary
 
Reported consolidated net sales decreased eight percent due primarily to the impact of the value spirits divestiture and year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic net sales increased four percent on a constant currency basis.
 
Branded wine organic net sales on a constant currency basis increased two percent overall, three percent in North America, five percent in Australia/New Zealand and decreased five percent in Europe.

During the second quarter, we worked closely with our U.S. distributors to minimize operational disruption during the transition period. As planned, we shipped additional inventories to newly appointed distributors to ensure adequate service levels with retailers. As a result, we experienced a second quarter sales benefit which we anticipate will reverse in the balance of the year, said Sands. As the transition activities are proceeding well, we believe we are now in a good position to execute for the key holiday season.
 
Total spirits organic net sales increased 49 percent for the quarter, primarily led by SVEDKA Vodka. We are extremely pleased at the continued success of the SVEDKA brand which is performing well at national chains, control states and on-premise, Sands said.
 
Operating Income, Net Income, Diluted EPS Commentary
 
Wines segment operating income increased $16 million versus the prior year second quarter. This increase is primarily due to U.S. shipment growth, savings from cost reduction efforts and the overlap of foreign currency losses from the prior year second quarter. These benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the value spirits business and a decrease in operating income from the international business.
 
Constellations equity earnings from its 50 percent interest in the Crown
Imports joint venture totaled $72 million, a decrease of three percent from the prior year second quarter.  For second quarter 2010, Crown Imports generated net sales of $693 million, a decrease of five percent, and operating income of $145 million, a decrease of three percent.
 
While sales remain challenging in the on-premise and convenience store channels, we continue to focus on optimizing promotional activity through targeted marketing and programming. In addition, we are introducing new packaging options and increasing media exposure, said Sands. This month, Crown will launch 24 oz. cans of Corona Extra and Corona Light into the convenience channel. The company has also increased its national media buys for Corona Extra and Corona Light during National Football League games and Major League baseball playoffs.
 
For second quarter 2010, pre-tax restructuring charges, acquisition-related integration costs and unusual items totaled $29 million compared to $129 million for the prior year second quarter.
 
 
The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 31 percent which reflects the completion of various income tax examinations during second quarter 2010. The company continues to anticipate a full-year comparable tax rate of 38 percent.
 
Summary
 
The macroeconomic environment remains challenging but we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization, said Sands. Powered by a strong portfolio of brands which includes Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Kim Crawford and SVEDKA, we believe we have the right strategies in place to organically grow the business. We intend to continue to reduce borrowings, improve free cash flow and optimize return on invested capital. Our expectations for the full year remain unchanged.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED, ORGANIC AND CONSTANT CURRENCY NET SALES
(in millions)
As the company sold certain Pacific Northwest wine brands on June 5, 2008; exited certain spirits production contracts in connection with the sale of a Canadian distilling facility on August 31, 2008; and sold certain value spirits brands on March 24, 2009, organic net sales for the respective periods are defined by the company as reported net sales less net sales of Pacific Northwest wine brands and/or net sales of certain spirits contract production services and/or value brands, as appropriate.  Organic net sales and percentage increase (decrease) in constant currency net sales (which excludes the impact of year over year currency exchange rate fluctuations) are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the company.  In addition, the company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year over year financial performance.

GUIDANCE - - DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND FREE CASH FLOW
(in millions, except per share data)
Free Cash Flow Guidance
Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes.  A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
