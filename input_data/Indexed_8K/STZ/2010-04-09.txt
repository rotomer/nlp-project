These requirements may change from time to time as laws or interpretations change.

Tax Liability and Withholding
                      The Participant acknowledges that the Companys obligation to issue or deliver Shares shall be subject to satisfaction of the Tax Liability.  Unless otherwise determined by the Company, withholding obligations shall be satisfied by having the Company or one if its Subsidiaries withhold all or a portion of any Shares that otherwise would be issued to the Participant upon settlement of the vested Performance Share Units; provided that amounts withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Companys tax withholding obligations. Such withheld Shares shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value as of the date the withholding obligations are satisfied.

The number of Performance Share Units to which the Participant will be entitled if the Participant satisfies the applicable service requirements will be calculated by the Committee based on the Companys Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the specified fiscal year.  Specifically, the Committee shall calculate the number of vested Performance Share Units for the Participant if the Participant satisfies the applicable service requirements by multiplying the Participants Target Number of Performance Share Units by the applicable percentage determined as set forth below based on the Companys Adjusted Earnings Per Share for the specified fiscal year.  As noted in the Terms and Conditions to this Agreement, special rules apply under certain circumstances, such as death, PSU Disability and PSU Change in Cont rol.

The number of the Participants vested Performance Share Units awarded for the Three Year Award shall be reduced by the number of the Performance Share Units the Participant received, if any, under the ____ Interim Award, but such number shall not be reduced below zero.
If the Companys Adjusted Earnings Per Share falls between designated levels of performance set forth in the above table, the percentage by which the Participants Target Number of Performance Shares Units is multiplied will be calculated by linear interpolation.
