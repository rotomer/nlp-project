(e)       Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
At a meeting held on April 28, 2011, the Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Constellation Brands, Inc. (the Company) took the following actions with regard to certain compensatory arrangements for its executive officers.
Criteria for 2012 Fiscal Year Incentive Award
The Committee adopted the 2012 Fiscal Year Award Program for Executive Officers (the 2012 Program for Executive Officers), thereby establishing the performance criteria and bonus opportunity under the Companys Annual Management Incentive Plan, as amended (the AMIP), for the Companys fiscal year ending February 29, 2012.  Pursuant to the 2012 Program for Executive Officers, potential incentive awards for the Companys 2012 fiscal year, if any, will equal 0.5% of the Companys Earnings Before Interest and Taxes for each of Richard Sands and Robert Sands and 0.25% of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes for each other executive officer, all as calculated under the AMIP and the 2012 Program for Executive Officers and measured for the period from March 1, 2011 through February 29, 2012.  The Committee reserves the right to exercise its negative discretion at the end of the Companys 2012 Fiscal Year to reduce the amounts calculated in the preceding sentence to a bonus payment for each of the Company's executive officers that the Committee believes to be appropriate based on such quantitative and qualitative factors as it deems appropriate, including but not limited to the Companys performance.
