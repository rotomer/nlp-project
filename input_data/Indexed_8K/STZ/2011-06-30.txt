Comparable measures, organic net sales measures and constant currency measures are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the results and underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the Company and/or in internal goal setting.

Accordingly, during the indicated period, organic net sales measures exclude the net sales of the Australian and United Kingdom business together with net sales of the Constellation North American business previously sold through the Companys Australian and United Kingdom business, as appropriate.

NEWS RELEASE

VICTOR, N.Y., June 30, 2011
Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE: STZ), the worlds leading premium wine company, reported today its first quarter 2012 results.
 
I am pleased with our first quarter financial performance which was generally in-line with our expectations. Highlights for the quarter include greatly improved operating margin and favorable U.S. product mix, strong free cash flow and ongoing debt reduction. We believe focused marketing efforts at Crown are driving momentum in the beer business, said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer, Constellation Brands. With the sale of our Australian and U.K. business, we have significantly improved our financial profile and simplified our business. As a result, we are taking the next logical step to increase efficiencies and streamline our operations worldwide.

** Hereafter referred to as equity earnings.

Net Sales Commentary
Reported consolidated net sales decreased 19 percent due primarily to the divestiture of the Australian and U.K. wine business.
 
North American net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased two percent primarily due to favorable product mix and lower promotion expense in the U.S., partially offset by a decrease in volume. As expected, our first quarter depletions were somewhat muted due to recent price increases for some of our value and specialty brands and the timing of promotional activities for our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio, said Sands. However, we remain committed to growing depletions at least in line with category growth on an annual basis while achieving our profit goals. This years focus on innovation and new product development has already led to the successful launch of almost half of the planned new product introductions for the year including Rex Goliath Moscato, Ruffino Prosecco, Arbor Mist Pomegranate Berry Pinot Noir and the Simply Naked product line.

Operating Income and Net Income Commentary
The increase in consolidated comparable basis operating income was driven by reduced corporate costs, an improvement in the North American operating results and the divestiture of the Australian and U.K. business, which generated an operating loss in the first quarter last year.
 
Constellations equity earnings from its 50 percent interest in the Crown Imports joint venture totaled $60 million, an increase of 10 percent from the prior year.  For first quarter 2012, Crown generated net sales of $678 million, an increase of nine percent, and operating income of $120 million, an increase of 10 percent.  The increase in net sales and operating income for Crown was primarily driven by volume growth due in part to the ongoing launch of the Victoria brand. Net sales and operating income also benefited from improvement in net pricing and product mix, partially offset by increased marketing spend.
 
Crowns marketplace momentum continued during the first quarter as it outperformed the industry and import category driven by key marketing initiatives for Cinco de Mayo and the launch of the second consecutive Win the Beach Getaway Sweepstakes, said Sands. In addition, distributor inventories are better positioned this year versus last year heading into the important summer selling season.
 
For first quarter 2012, pre-tax restructuring charges and unusual items totaled $14 million compared to $7 million for the prior year first quarter.
 
Interest expense totaled $44 million, a decrease of nine percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings.
 
The comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter was 37 percent and compares to a 24 percent rate for the prior year first quarter which reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items.
 
During first quarter 2012, the company began to implement operational changes to further align the business, increase efficiencies and reduce its cost structure following the sale of its Australian and U.K. business. Constellation anticipates generating cost savings from this initiative of more than $10 million, the majority of which is expected to be realized in fiscal 2013. These savings include synergies gained primarily from realigning certain administrative, operational and commercial functions on a global basis.

In connection with this initiative, the company expects to incur one-time cash charges of approximately $26 million. Nearly all of the charges are expected to be recognized during fiscal 2012.
Free Cash Flow Commentary
Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $220 million. Our strong free cash flow generation helped drive a $244 million decrease in debt and reduce our debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio to the low three times range at the end of the fiscal quarter, said Bob Ryder, chief financial officer, Constellation Brands. For fiscal 2012, the company is on target to achieve free cash flow in the range of $600 to $650 million, including the funding of the restructuring program.

RECONCILIATION OF REPORTED, ORGANIC AND CONSTANT CURRENCY NET SALES
(in millions)
As the company sold 80.1% of its Australian and U.K. business on January 31, 2011, organic net sales for the three months ended May 31, 2010, are defined by the company as reported net sales less net sales of CWAE (as defined below), plus CWNA (as defined below) intercompany net sales to CWAE, as appropriate.  Organic net sales and percentage increase (decrease) in constant currency net sales (which excludes the impact of year-over-year currency exchange rate fluctuations) are provided because management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the underlying business trends of the continuing operations of the company.  In addition, the company believes this information provides investors better insight on underlying business trends and results in order to evaluate year-over-year financial performance.

GUIDANCE - DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND FREE CASH FLOW
(in millions, except per share data)
 
Free Cash Flow Guidance
Free cash flow, as defined in the reconciliation below, is considered a liquidity measure and is considered to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated, which can then be used, after required debt service and dividend payments, for other general corporate purposes.  A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP.
