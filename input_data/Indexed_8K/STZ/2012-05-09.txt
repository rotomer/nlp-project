On May 3, 2012 (the "Closing Date"), Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Constellation"), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"), and certain other lenders (all such parties other than Constellation are collectively referred to as the "Lenders") entered into a new Credit Agreement (the "2012 Credit Agreement").
The 2012 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $1,650 million, consisting of a $550 million term loan facility maturing on May 3, 2017 (the "Term A Facility"), a $250 million term loan facility maturing on May 3, 2019 (the "Term A-1 Facility"), and an $850 million revolving credit facility (including commitments for swingline loans of up to $50 million and commitments in respect of letters of credit of up to $200 million) which terminates on May 3, 2017 (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The 2012 Credit Agreement also permits Constellation from time to time after the Closing Date to elect to increase the Lenders' revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions. The minimum aggregate principal amount of such incremental revolving credit commitment increases or additional term loans may be no less than $25 million and the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all such incremental revolving credit commitment increases and additional term loans, other than term loans the proceeds of which are applied to repay existing term loans, may be no more than $750 million.
The Term A Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to (i) during the first two years following the Closing Date, 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term A Facility, and (ii) thereafter, 2.50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term A Facility, with the balance payable on May 3, 2017. The Term A-1 Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 0.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term A-1 Facility, with the balance payable on May 3, 2019.
The rate of interest payable under the 2012 Credit Agreement, at Constellation's option, will be equal to (i) LIBOR plus a margin, or (ii) the highest of the federal funds base rate plus 0.50%, the prime rate, and LIBOR plus 1.00% (the "Base Rate"), plus a margin. The margin is adjustable based upon Constellation's debt ratio, as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement. The margin with respect to the Term A Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility is (a) until financial statements for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date are delivered, 1.75% per annum in the case of LIBOR borrowings and 0.75% per annum in the case of Base Rate borrowings, and (b) thereafter, based on Constellation's debt ratio as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, between 1.25% and 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.25% and 1.25% for Base Rate borrowings. The margin with respect to the Term A-1 Facility is (x) until financial statements for the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date are delivered, 2.00% per annum in the case of LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% per annum in the case of Base Rate borrowings, and (y) thereafter, based on Constellation's debt ratio as defined in the 2012 Credit Agreement, between 1.50% and 2.50% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.50% and 1.50% for Base Rate borrowings.
The obligations under the 2012 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Constellation (the "Guarantors") pursuant to a guarantee agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Guarantee Agreement"). Each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, the prompt and complete payment and performance of the indebtedness and other monetary obligations of Constellation under the 2012 Credit Agreement. The obligations under the 2012 Credit Agreement are also secured by a pledge of (i) 100% of the ownership interests in certain of Constellation's United States subsidiaries, and (ii) 55-65% of certain interests of certain of Constellation's foreign subsidiaries.
 
The 2012 Credit Agreement sets forth certain representations and warranties of Constellation to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Constellation and its subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained in the 2012 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict Constellation's non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net debt coverage ratio.
The 2012 Credit Agreement provides for specified events of default some of which provide for grace periods, including failure to pay any principal, letter of credit disbursement or interest when due, any representation or warranty made by Constellation proving to be incorrect in any material respect, failure to comply with covenants or conditions, defaults relating to other material indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting Constellation or its subsidiaries, Constellation or its subsidiaries becoming subject to certain judgments, a change in control of Constellation, or a defect in the Lenders' lien against the collateral securing the obligations under the 2012 Credit Agreement.
In the event of a default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders must, take either or both of the following actions: (i) terminate the Lenders' commitments to make loans under the 2012 Credit Agreement; and (ii) declare all obligations under the 2012 Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, the commitments of the Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of Constellation will become immediately due and payable.
Constellation has used a portion of the proceeds of borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement to repay the outstanding obligations under its 2006 Credit Agreement (as defined below) and intends to use the remaining availability under the 2012 Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.
As of May 3, 2012, under the 2012 Credit Agreement Constellation had no outstanding revolving credit loans, no outstanding swingline loans, Term A Facility loans of $550 million aggregate principal amount bearing an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%, Term A-1 Facility loans of $250 million aggregate principal amount bearing an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.00%, issued and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $13.4 million, no outstanding incremental term loans, and approximately $836.6 million principal amount in revolving loans available to be drawn.
Certain of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent were lenders, agents, and parties under the 2006 Credit Agreement, and certain of such Lenders, the Administrative Agent, and their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking, brokerage, and other financial advisory services for Constellation and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses. One of the Lenders, Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company ("M&T"), is the trustee under an Indenture dated as of April 17, 2012 and Supplemental Indenture No. 1 thereto dated as of April 17, 2012, in each case between the Company and M&T, as trustee, under which the Company has issued $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2012 Indenture"). Certain of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent are agents and lenders under certain credit facilities to members of the Sands family and other affiliates of the Company and the Sands family, certain of which credit facilities are secured by pledges of shares of class A common stock and class B common stock of the Company. In addition, one of the Company's executive officers is a member of the boards of directors of one of the Lenders and certain of its affiliates.

At the time of termination, the outstanding principal amount under the 2006 Credit Agreement consisted of $572.6 million and $117.5 million aggregate principal amount of term loans maturing on June 5, 2013 and June 5, 2015, respectively, and $18.0 million aggregate principal amount under the revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement (excluding issued and outstanding letters of credit of approximately $13.4 million) which was set to expire on June 5, 2013.

Each such notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000 and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a written Swingline Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any telephonic Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Loan Borrowing (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in Section 2.04(a) or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, the Swingline Lender shall make such Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(c), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
(c) (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of the Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02 and Section 2.03, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments of the applicable Class and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Borrowing Request promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Borrowing Request available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Borrowing Request, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.
(ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such Base Rate Loan in accordance with clause (i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and such Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving
 
Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender's Base Rate Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(iii) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Base Rate Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Base Rate Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein.
(d) (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender.
(ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.08 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e) The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender.
(f) The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender.

(b) .
Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the applicable Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent not later than noon at least three Business Days (or such later date and time as the applicable Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the applicable Issuing Bank may require.

Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the applicable Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require.
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable Issuing Bank will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, such Issuing Bank will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless an Issuing Bank has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such Issuing Bank's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit by an Issuing Bank, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Issuing Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an ""); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the applicable Issuing Bank to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the "") in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to an Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit
Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
Non-Extension Notice Date
 
Expiration Date; provided, however, that no Issuing Bank shall permit any such extension if (A) such Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.05(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Credit Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such Issuing Bank not to permit such extension.
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(c) .
Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) such Issuing Bank (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrower shall have notified such Issuing Bank promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse such Issuing Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than noon on the Business Day following any payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the Business Day following any payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the Borrower shall reimburse such Issuing Bank through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing, and in the applicable currency. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such Issuing Bank by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the ""), and the amount of such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Business Day following the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Borrowing Notice) and until such Unreimbursed Amount is repaid or refinanced it shall accrue interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans. Any notice given by the applicable Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
Unreimbursed Amount
(ii) Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent's office for payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.05(c)(iii), such Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount in respect of a Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be
 
due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.05.
(iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Issuing Bank.
(v) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse each Issuing Bank for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit of the applicable Class issued by it, as contemplated by this Section 2.05(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against such Issuing Bank, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse an Issuing Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(c) by the time specified in Section 2.05(c)(ii), such Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender's Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Repayment of Participations
(i) At any time after an Issuing Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such Revolving Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.05(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such Issuing Bank any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.08 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
 
(e) . The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse each Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued by it and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the applicable Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) any payment by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
Obligations Absolute
(f) . Each Revolving Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under any Letter of Credit, no Issuing Bank shall have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; , , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Issuing Bank shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.05(e); , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against any Issuing Bank, and such Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by such Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Issuing Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

(E) two properly completed and duly signed original copies of any other form prescribed by applicable U.S. federal income tax laws (including the Treasury Regulations) as a basis for claiming a complete exemption from, or a reduction in, United States federal withholding Tax on any payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents.
(3) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their FATCA obligations, to determine whether such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's FATCA obligations and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (3), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.16(d), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability prepared in good faith and delivered to the Tax Indemnitee, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of another Tax Indemnitee, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Tax Indemnitee
 
(f) If and to the extent a Tax Indemnitee determines, in its sole good faith discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Loan Party or with respect to which a Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, then such Tax Indemnitee shall promptly pay over such refund to the relevant Loan Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of the Tax Indemnitee and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that such Loan Party, upon the request of the Tax Indemnitee, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Tax Indemnitee in the event the Tax Indemnitee is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(f) shall not be construed to require a Tax Indemnitee to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.
provided
(g) For purposes of this Section 2.16, the term "Lender" shall include any Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.17. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of L/C Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff prior to 2:00 p.m., on the date when due, in immediately available funds. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent Office, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
(b) If at any time prior to an exercise of remedies pursuant to Article VII (or prior to the date of termination of the Commitments in full and acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article VII), insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed L/C Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed L/C Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) (i) After the exercise of remedies provided for in Article VII (or after the automatic termination of the Commitments and acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Article VII), any amounts received on account of the Obligations shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as follows:
, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and amounts payable under Article II) payable to the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such;
First
, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees, indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest and fees payable pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b)) payable to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (including fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the Issuing Bank arising under the Loan Documents), ratably among them in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;
Second
 
, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Sections 2.11(a) and (b) and interest on the Loans, L/C Borrowings and other Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, ratably among the Lenders and the Issuing Banks in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;
Third
, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid principal of the Loans, L/C Borrowings and Obligations then owing under Secured Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Obligations, and to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Banks, to Cash Collateralize that portion of Letter of Credit Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise Cash Collateralized by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.05, ratably among the Secured Parties in proportion to the respective amounts described in this clause Fourth held by them and the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Obligations that have not been Cash Collateralized; and
Fourth
, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.
Last
(ii) Subject to Sections 2.05, amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.
(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cash Management Obligations and Obligations arising under Secured Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if the Administrative Agent has not, prior to the time of the making of any such distribution, received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request, from the applicable Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to the Credit Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article VIII hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a "Lender" party hereto.
(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this clause shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant in accordance with Section 9.04. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
 
(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the relevant Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.17 or 9.03, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payments.
SECTION 2.18. .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Any Lender claiming reimbursement of such costs and expenses shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, if any Lender fails to grant a consent in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.02 for which the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender is required but the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, but excluding the consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.04 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent);
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.15) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
 
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.19. .
Expansion Option
(a) The Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date elect to increase the Revolving Commitments or any Extended Revolving Commitments (the "") or add one or more tranches of term loans (each, an ""), in each case in an aggregate principal amount of not less than $25,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such Increased Commitments and all such Incremental Term Loans (other than Refinancing Term Loans) does not exceed $750,000,000. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Revolving Commitment or Extended Revolving Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loan, an ""), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an ""), to increase their existing Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loan; that each Augmenting Lender (and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Increasing Lender) shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and, in the case of an Increased Commitment, each Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender (such consents not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Without the consent of any Lenders other than the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.19. Increases of Revolving Commitments, and Extended Revolving Commitment and new Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loans shall be permitted under this clause unless (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments or borrowing of such Incremental Term Loan, the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received such opinions and other certificates and documents as it may reasonably request and (iii) the Borrower shall be in compliance, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis (assuming for this purpose that all Increased Commitments were fully drawn), with the covenants contained in Section 6.09 as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter of the Borrower for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b) prior to such time. On the effective date of any increase in the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made (assuming that any Increased Commitments were fully drawn), (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, if, on the date of such increase, there are any Revolving Loans of the applicable Class outstanding, such Revolving Loans shall on or prior to the effectiveness of such Increased Commitments be prepaid to the extent necessary from the proceeds of additional Revolving Loans made hereunder by the Increasing Lenders and Augmenting Lenders, so that, after giving

provided
 
effect to such prepayments and any borrowings on such date of all or any portion of such Increased Commitments, the principal balance of all outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class owing to each Lender with a Revolving Commitment of such Class is equal to such Lender's pro rata share (after giving effect to any nonratable Increased Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.19) of all then outstanding Revolving Loans of such Class. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the borrowing notice, minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the second preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.15 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The terms of any Incremental Term Loans shall be as set forth in the amendment to this Agreement providing for such Incremental Term Loans; that (i) no Lender will be required to participate in any such Incremental Facility, (ii) the final maturity date of any Incremental Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Term A Loan Maturity Date, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Incremental Term Loans shall not be shorter than the then remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term A Loans, (iv) Incremental Term Loans shall not participate on a greater than pro rata basis with the other Term Loans in any optional or mandatory prepayment hereunder, (v) the interest margins, fees and original issue discount for the Incremental Term Loans shall be determined by the Borrower and the lenders of the Incremental Term Loans, (vi) Incremental Term Loans and Increased Commitments shall be secured on a pari passu basis with the other Loans and (vii) any Increased Commitments shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation applicable to the Revolving Commitments or Extended Revolving Commitments and any Incremental Term Loans shall be on terms and pursuant to documentation to be determined, that, to the extent such terms and documentation are not consistent with the Term A Facility (except to the extent permitted by clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) above) they shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall seek commitments in respect of any Incremental Facility from existing Lenders or from additional banks, financial institutions and other institutional lenders reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent who will become Lenders in connection therewith.
provided
provided
(b) This Section 2.19 shall override any provisions in Section 9.02 to the contrary.

In order to establish any Extended Term Loans, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders under the Existing Term Loan Class) (an "") setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans to be established, which shall be consistent with the Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class from which such Extended Term Loans are to be converted except that:
Existing Term Loan Class

(ii) the interest margins with respect to the Extended Term Loans may be different than the Applicable Rate for the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Class and upfront fees may be paid to the Extending Term Lenders to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment; and
(iii) the Additional Credit Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply only after the
Term A-1 Loan Maturity Date.
 
(b) Any Extended Term Loans converted pursuant to any Extension Request shall be designated a series of Extended Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement; that, subject to the limitations set forth in clause (a) above, any Extended Term Loans converted from an Existing Term Loan Class may, to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment and consistent with the requirements set forth above, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans.
provided
(c) The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Loan Class are requested to respond. No Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Term Loans of any Existing Term Loan Class converted into Extended Term Loans pursuant to any Extension Request. Any Lender wishing to have all or a portion of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class subject to such Extension Request (such Lender an "") converted into Extended Term Loans shall notify the Administrative Agent (an "") on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class which it has elected to request be converted into Extended Term Loans (subject to any minimum denomination requirements reasonably imposed by the Administrative Agent and acceptable to the Borrower). In the event that the aggregate amount of Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Term Loans requested pursuant to an Extension Request, Term Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class subject to Extension Elections shall be converted to Extended Term Loans on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Term Loans included in each such Extension Election (subject to any minimum denomination requirements reasonably imposed by the Administrative Agent and acceptable to the Borrower).

(d) The Borrower may, with the consent of each Person providing an Extended Revolving Commitment, the Administrative Agent and any Person acting as swingline lender or issuing bank under such Extended Revolving Commitments, amend this Agreement pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to provide for Extended Revolving Commitments and to incorporate the terms of such Extended Revolving Commitments into this Agreement on substantially the same basis as provided with respect to the applicable Revolving Commitments; that (i) the establishment of any such Extended Revolving Commitments shall be accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Commitments of the applicable Class, (ii) any reduction in the applicable Revolving Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be directed to a disproportional reduction of such Revolving Commitments of any Lender providing an Extended Revolving Commitment and (iii) any Extended Revolving Commitments provided pursuant to this clause (d) shall be in a minimum principal amount of $200,000,000.
provided
(e) Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Commitments shall be established pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to this Agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Extending Term Lender or Lender providing an Extended Revolving Commitment which shall be consistent with the provisions set forth above (but which shall not require the consent of any other Lender other than those consents required pursuant to this Agreement). Each Additional Credit Extension Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders, the Loan Parties and the other parties hereto. In connection with any Additional Credit Extension Amendment, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall enter into such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent (which shall not require any consent from any Lender other than those consents provided pursuant to this Agreement) in order to ensure that the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments are provided with the benefit of the applicable Collateral Documents and shall deliver such other documents, certificates and opinions of counsel in connection therewith as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent. No Lender shall be under any obligation to provide any Extended Term Loan or Extended Revolving Commitment.
(f) The provisions of this Section 2.20 shall override any provision of Section 9.02 to the contrary.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America as its collateral agent and authorizes Bank of America to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the collateral agent by the terms hereof and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the collateral agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, and the Borrower shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions, except as expressly set forth in subparagraph (f) below.
 
(b) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or by the other Loan Documents), that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided herein) or in the absence of its own bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or the Issuing Bank, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
provided
(d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
(e) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply
 
to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
(f) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and (unless an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII shall have occurred and be continuing) with the consent of the Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent. Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition of Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person, remove such Person as Administrative Agent, and the Borrower in consultation with the Lenders shall, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Required Lenders in consultation with the Borrower shall, appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States; that, without the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld), the Required Lenders shall not be permitted to select a successor that is not a U.S. financial institution described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(ii) or a U.S. branch of a foreign bank described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A). If no such successor shall have been appointed by the Borrower or the Required Lenders, as applicable, and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the ""), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with notice on the Removal Effective Date.

(g) Each Lender and the Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
 
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and the Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
(h) To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this clause (h). The agreements in this clause (h) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, a "Lender" shall, for purposes of this clause (h), include any Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank.
(i) The Lenders irrevocably agree:
(i) that any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document shall be automatically released (A) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (in each case, other than (x) obligations under Secured Hedge Agreements, (y) Cash Management Obligations and (z) contingent reimbursement and indemnification obligations, in each case not yet accrued and payable) and the expiration or termination or cash collateralization of all Letters of Credit (or the making of other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Lender in their sole discretion), (B) at the time the Property subject to such Lien is transferred or to be transferred as part of or in connection with any transfer permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any Person (other than any transfer to another Loan Party) including to facilititate any transfer of Equity Interests of Schenley Distilleries Inc. or any Foreign Subisidiary to any other Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party (whether directly to any such Subsidiary or through one or more substantially concurrent transfers involving any Loan Party or any other Subsidiary), (C) subject to Section 9.02, if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) or (D) if the Property subject to such Lien is owned by a Guarantor, upon release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Guarantee under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to clause (iii) below;
(ii)(A) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(e) and (B) that the Administrative Agent is authorized (but not required) to release or subordinate any Lien on any Property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such Property that is permitted by any other clause of Section 6.02; and
(iii) that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement and Pledge Agreement if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder.
 
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to this clause (i). In each case as specified in this clause (i), the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this clause (i).
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the "arrangers," "bookrunning managers" or "co-syndication agents" listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder.

Waivers; Amendments
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by clause (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of the Obligations shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.2).
(c) Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party hereunder.
(d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification and contingent expense reimbursement obligations, Obligations in respect of Secured Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Obligations) of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by payment in full, the Commitments have been terminated and either no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or each outstanding Letter of Credit has been cash collateralized so that it is fully secured to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement any Loan Party may be free from any of the Obligations.

2.2 . Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section 2.2 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing agreement by the Guarantor shall operate as a waiver of any subrogation rights.

(b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of the Obligations shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.2).
(c) Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party hereunder.
(d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification and contingent expense reimbursement obligations, Obligations in respect of Secured Hedge Agreements and Cash Management Obligations) of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by payment in full, the Commitments have been terminated and either no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or each outstanding Letter of Credit has been cash collateralized so that it is fully secured to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement any Loan Party may be free from any of the Obligations.

2.2 . Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section 2.2 shall in no respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.
Right of Contribution
2.3 .

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing agreement by the Guarantor shall operate as a waiver of any subrogation rights.

upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, and the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith, any Swap Agreement and any agreement giving rise to Cash Management Obligations may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, or, solely in the case of any Swap Agreement or any agreement giving rise to Cash Management Obligations, the applicable Hedge Bank or Cash Management Bank) may deem reasonably advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.

Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Section 2, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right
Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional
 
of offset, or any release of any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
2.6 . The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
Reinstatement

(d) all consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations of, and filings and registrations with, any governmental authority required under applicable law and regulations for the making and performance of this Agreement have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, except where the failure of which to obtain or make could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.
(b) By its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Secured Party agrees that this Agreement may be enforced only by the Administrative Agent and that no Secured Party shall have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement.
