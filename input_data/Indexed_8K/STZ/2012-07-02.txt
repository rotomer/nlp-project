Membership Interest Purchase Agreement
Constellation Beers Ltd., a Maryland corporation ("Constellation Beers"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Constellation"), currently owns a 50% interest in Crown Imports LLC ("Crown Imports"). Crown Imports is a joint venture with GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Modelo"), through which Modelo's Mexican beer portfolio (the "Modelo Brands") have been imported, marketed and sold in the U.S. since January 2007. Seller owns the other 50% interest in Crown Imports, which has the exclusive right to import, market and sell primarily the Modelo Brands, which include Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria, in all 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia and Guam pursuant to the terms of an Importer Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2007, by and between Extrade II, S.A. de C.V. ("Extrade") and Crown Imports (as amended, the "Existing Importer Agreement").
On June 28, 2012, Constellation Beers, Constellation Brands Beach Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation ("CBBH"), Constellation and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, a Belgian corporation ("ABI"), entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, ABI will cause the Seller to sell, and Constellation Beers and CBBH will purchase, Seller's membership interest in Crown Imports (the "Purchased Interest"). Constellation Beers will purchase 98% of the Purchased Interest, and CBBH will purchase 2% of the Purchased Interest. As a result of the purchase of the Purchased Interest by Constellation Beers and CBBH (the "Transaction"), Constellation Beers will own a 99% interest in Crown Imports, CBBH will own a 1% interest in Crown Imports and Crown Imports will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation. The purchase price for the Purchased Interest is $1,845 million, to be paid on the date of the closing of the Transaction (the "Closing Date").
The Purchase Agreement contemplates that Crown Imports and Extrade will amend and restate the Existing Importer Agreement on the Closing Date (as amended and restated, the "Restated Importer Agreement") pursuant to which Crown Imports will continue to have the exclusive right to sell in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia and Guam), including for resale, the Modelo Brands as well as any new products introduced by Modelo in the U.S. The term of the Restated Importer Agreement will continue in perpetuity; provided, Extrade has the right to terminate the Restated Importer Agreement once every ten years and upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Importer Agreement) of Constellation where control is acquired by a Prohibited Owner (as defined in the Importer Agreement), in each of which cases Extrade will be required to pay Crown Imports a "Restored Profits Fee" equal to thirteen (13) multiplied by the EBIT of the Import Business of Crown Imports (as EBIT and Import Business are defined in the Restated Importer Agreement). Extrade will also have the right to terminate the Restated Importer Agreement without paying the Restored Profits Fee upon a breach by Crown Imports, after a notice and cure period, of a material payment obligation or upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or receivership events affecting Crown Imports.
The Purchase Agreement contemplates that Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo, S.A. DE C.V. will enter into an Amended and Restated Sub-License Agreement pursuant to which Crown Imports will continue to have the right to use trademarks related to the Import Business (the "Restated Sub-License Agreement").
The closing of the Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and the consummation of certain transactions between ABI and Modelo and certain of its affiliates (the "GM Transaction"). The Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either Constellation or ABI if the Transaction has not been consummated within 18 months or if the GM Transaction is terminated. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated because the GM Transaction is
 
 
terminated, ABI must pay Constellation a termination fee of $75 million. The Transaction is projected to be consummated during the first calendar quarter of 2013.
Constellation plans to finance the purchase price for the Purchased Interest and other costs related to the Transaction with available cash and proceeds from a combination of debt financings including incremental term loans as contemplated by its existing Credit Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2012, among Constellation, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders and other parties party thereto (the "2012 Credit Agreement"), revolver borrowings under the 2012 Credit Agreement and the issuance of certain notes or debt securities. Pursuant to the Interim Loan Agreement (as defined below), the Banks (as defined below) have committed to make loans sufficient to finance the Transaction and related costs. If, notwithstanding the Interim Loan Agreement, Constellation is unable to obtain financing sufficient to enable Constellation Beers and CBBH to pay the purchase price for the entire Purchased Interest, Constellation Beers and CBBH must purchase at least one-half of the Purchased Interest for a pro-rated purchase price plus a fee of $150 million. In that event, the Seller may sell the portion of the Purchased Interest not purchased by Constellation Beers or CBBH to any other person except a Prohibited Owner. In such event, Constellation Beers, CBBH and ABI or any such purchaser will enter into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement for Crown Imports (the "Restated LLC Agreement"). The Restated LLC Agreement requires minimum distributions to the minority holder(s) and gives Constellation Beers a right of first refusal in the event of a transfer of membership interests in Crown Imports by a minority holder after ten years following the Closing Date.
The above descriptions of the Purchase Agreement, and the agreements attached thereto as exhibits, including the form of the Restated Importer Agreement, the form of the Restated Sub-License Agreement and the form of the Restated LLC Agreement, are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Purchase Agreement (and such forms of agreements attached thereto as exhibits) which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Interim Loan Agreement
To provide certainty of financing to fund the purchase price for the Purchased Interest and the other costs of the Transaction, on June 28, 2012, Constellation, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent") and a lender, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as a lender (each of Bank of America, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lenders, the "Banks"), entered into an Interim Loan Agreement (the "Interim Loan Agreement").
The Interim Loan Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of $1,875 million, consisting of a $650 million term loan (the "Bridge A Loan") and a $1,225 million term loan (the "Bridge B Loan" and, together with the Bridge A Loan, the "Bridge Loans"). The Bridge Loans must be borrowed, if at all, in connection with the closing of the Transaction. The amount of the Bridge A Loan will be reduced by the amount of the first $650,000,000 of proceeds from any debt securities issued by Constellation after the date of the Interim Loan Agreement that are actually applied to pay a portion of the consideration payable under the Purchase Agreement on the Closing Date, and the Bridge B Loan will be reduced by the amount of any other cash that is actually utilized on the Closing Date to fund a portion of the consideration payable under the Purchase Agreement. The commitments to make each Bridge Loan expire on the earliest of (i) 5:00 p. m., New York City time, on December 30, 2013 unless the Closing Date occurs on or prior to such date, (ii) the date of consummation of the Transaction without any borrowing under such Bridge Loan and (iii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement prior to the closing of the Transaction.
The obligation to make the Bridge Loans is subject to limited conditions, including: (i) the delivery of certain customary documentation, (ii) the delivery of a certificate attesting to the solvency of Constellation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) Constellation having paid all fees and expenses
 
 
due to the Banks and the arrangers in connection with financing activities relating to the Transaction, (iv) the Transaction having closed without a material adverse change in its terms, and (v) certain limited representations and warranties made by Constellation being true and correct in all material respects on the Closing Date. Constellation intends to use the proceeds of the Bridge Loans, if any, to finance the Transaction and related expenses.
The Bridge Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) LIBOR plus a margin, and (ii) an agreed cap (the "Total Cap"), until the earlier of the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Rollover Date") or the breach by Constellation of certain commitments, subject to a notice and cure period, relating to the offering of debt securities and the issuance of other debt to finance the Transaction or refinance the Bridge Loans (a "Demand Failure Event"), after which Rollover Date or Demand Failure Event the Bridge Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Total Cap. The margin for periods prior to the earlier of the Rollover Date or a Demand Failure Event is 4.75% for the first three months following the Closing Date and increases by 0.50% every 3 months thereafter.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and requirements, from and after the Rollover Date the lenders under the Interim Loan Agreement from time to time (the "Lenders") will have the right to exchange Bridge Loans for exchange notes to be issued under an indenture to be entered into by Constellation and having terms as summarized in an exhibit to the Interim Loan Agreement ("Exchange Notes"). In the event of an issuance of Exchange Notes, Constellation would be required to enter into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the holders of Exchange Notes would be entitled to require Constellation to register the resale of the Exchange Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
The Bridge Loans will mature on the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date. Subject to certain limitations and until the Rollover Date, Constellation must offer to prepay the Bridge Loans with the proceeds of certain dispositions of assets unless such proceeds have been reinvested in assets useful to its business. In addition, Constellation must offer to prepay the Bridge Loans in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Interim Loan Agreement) and pay a 1% premium if a prepayment is made after the occurrence of a Demand Failure Event as a result of such an offer. Constellation may prepay the Bridge Loans at any time without premium or penalty, except Constellation must pay a make-whole amount in connection with any prepayment after the occurrence of a Demand Failure Event.
The obligations under the Interim Loan Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Constellation (the "Guarantors") pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2012 (the "Guarantee Agreement"). Each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders, the prompt and complete payment and performance of the indebtedness and other monetary obligations of Constellation under the Interim Loan Agreement.
The Interim Loan Agreement sets forth certain representations and warranties of Constellation to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Constellation and its subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained in the Interim Loan Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict Constellation's non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, sale and leasebacks, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds, however certain affirmative and negative covenants are effective only from and after the Closing Date, and in some cases run only through the Rollover Date, and in other cases are effective only from and after the Rollover Date.
 
 
The Interim Loan Agreement provides for specified events of default, some of which provide for grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, any representation or warranty made by Constellation proving to be incorrect in any material respect, failure to comply with covenants or conditions, defaults relating to other material indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting Constellation or its subsidiaries, Constellation or its subsidiaries becoming subject to certain judgments prior to the Rollover Date, and the Guarantee Agreement ceasing to be in full force and effect or an assertion to such effect being made by Constellation or any Guarantor. In the event of a default, the Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of Lenders must, declare all obligations under the Interim Loan Agreement immediately due and payable. For certain events of default related to insolvency and receivership, all outstanding obligations of Constellation will become immediately due and payable. An event of default will not provide a basis for the Lenders to cancel their commitments to make the Bridge Loans or to fund the Bridge Loans if the closing conditions are satisfied.
Constellation has the right to consent to any assignment by either Bank if after giving effect to the assignment, such Bank would hold less than 20% of the aggregate commitments to make Bridge Loans. Constellation has also agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it will not consent to any such reduction below this threshold.
The Banks are lenders under the 2012 Credit Agreement, and the Administrative Agent is the administrative agent under the 2012 Credit Agreement. The Banks and their respective affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking, brokerage, and advisory services for Constellation and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with anticipated financing activities relating to the Transaction the Banks, certain of their affiliates and Constellation have entered into an engagement letter with respect to the syndication of certain loan facilities and a fee letter, the Administrative Agent, one of its affiliates and Constellation have entered into an administrative agency letter, and certain affiliates of the Banks and Constellation have entered into an engagement letter with respect to the offering of certain notes and debt securities. In addition, the Banks are lenders under certain credit facilities to members of the Sands family and other affiliates of Constellation and the Sands family, certain of which credit facilities are secured by pledges of shares of class A common stock and class B common stock of Constellation.
The above descriptions of the Interim Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Interim Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement, as applicable, which are respectively attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

(d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this clause shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant in accordance with Section 9.04. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
 
(f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.17 or 9.03, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payments.
SECTION 2.18.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. Any Lender claiming reimbursement of such costs and expenses shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth such costs and expenses in reasonable detail which shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, if any Lender fails to grant a consent in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.02 for which the consent of each Lender or each affected Lender is required but the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, but excluding the consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), that:
provided
(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.04 (unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent);
(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.15) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and
(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions, except as expressly set forth in subparagraph (f) below.
(b) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice describing such Default thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel
 
(who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
(e) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
(f) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and (unless an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII shall have occurred and be continuing) with the consent of the Borrower (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
(g) Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
(h) To the extent required by any applicable Laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall
 
be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this clause (h). The agreements in this clause (h) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
(i) The Lenders irrevocably agree that any Guarantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement if such Person ceases to be a guarantor of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement.
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be required pursuant to Section 9.02) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement pursuant to this clause (i). In each case as specified in this clause (i), the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this clause (i).
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the "arrangers," "bookrunning managers" or "syndication agent" listed on the cover page hereof shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder. Any right given to any Arranger hereunder may be exercised or not exercised in such Arranger's sole discretion and is for the benefit of such Arranger and not any other Person.

This certificate is furnished pursuant to Section 4.01(d) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 28, 2012 (the ""), among Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent thereunder and the other parties from time to time party thereto. Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
Borrower
The undersigned hereby certifies, solely in such undersigned's capacity as [Title] of the Borrower, and not individually, that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), on the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions, are Solvent. "" as used herein means, with respect to any Person on any date of determination, that on such date (a) the fair value of the property of such Person is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such Person, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of such Person is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person on its debts as they become absolute and matured, (c) such Person does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur debts or liabilities beyond such Person's ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured and (d) such Person is not engaged in any business, as conducted on such date and as proposed to be conducted following such date, for which such Person's property would constitute an unreasonably small capital. The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.
Solvent
The undersigned is familiar with the business and financial position of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. In reaching the conclusions set forth in this Solvency Certificate, the undersigned has made such other investigations and inquiries as the undersigned has deemed appropriate.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this Certificate in such undersigned's capacity as [Title] of the Borrower, on behalf of the Borrower, and not individually, as of the date first stated above.
 
 
EXHIBIT D
 
 
Set forth below is a summary of the required terms of the Exchange Notes. To the extent not specified below, all terms of the Exchange Notes shall be consistent with the terms of the indenture governing the Borrower's existing 6% senior notes due 2022 (the "").
2022 Notes Indenture
 
Annex I
Pursuant to the Exchange Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantors will agree, at their expense, to:
 
 
 
"" means each Exchange Note and related guarantees until the earlier of (i) the date on which such Exchange Note and related guarantees have been sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement; and (ii) the date that is two years after the initial issuance of Exchange Notes under the Exchange Notes Indenture (subject to extension for a period of time equal to the aggregate period of time during which the Borrower has suspended the availability of the prospectus as contemplated below).
Registrable Securities
The Borrower will also agree to provide to each holder or Exchange Notes copies of the prospectus contained in the shelf registration statement, notify each such holder when the shelf registration statement has become effective and take certain other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the Exchange Notes and related guarantees. A holder who sells Exchange Notes pursuant to the shelf registration statement generally will be required to be named a selling security holder in the related prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers and will be bound by the provisions of the Exchange Notes Registration Rights Agreement which are applicable to that holder (including certain indemnification and contribution provisions). If a shelf registration statement covering those securities is not effective, they may not be sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws or in a transaction not subject to those laws.
The Borrower may suspend the holders' use of the prospectus for a maximum of 45 days in any 90-day period, and not to exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 12-month period, if the Borrower, in good faith, determines that because of valid business reasons (not including avoidance of its obligations under the Exchange Notes Registration Rights Agreement), including without
limitation proposed or pending corporate developments and similar events or because of filings with the SEC, it is in the Borrower's best interests to suspend such use. The Borrower need not specify the nature of the event giving rise to a suspension in any notice to holders of the Exchange Notes of the existence of such suspension.
Each of the following is a "":
registration default
 
 
 
If a registration statement default occurs, liquidated damages in the form of additional interest ("") will accrue on the Exchange Notes that are Registrable Securities, from and including the day following the registration default to but excluding the earlier of (1) the day on which the registration default has been cured and (2) the first day on which there are no longer any Registrable Securities. Liquidated damages will be paid semi-annually in arrears, with the first semi-annual payment due on the first interest payment date, as applicable, following the date on which such liquidated damages begin to accrue, and will accrue at a rate equal to 0.25% per annum of the principal amount of an Exchange Note that is a Registrable Security to and including the 90
additional interest
th
day following such registration default. Thereafter, interest shall increase by an additional 0.25% at the beginning of each subsequent 90 day period. Such interest shall be payable on the regular interest payment dates for the Exchange Notes. In no event will liquidated damages accrue at a rate per year exceeding 1.00% or on any Exchange Note that is not a Registrable Security. The holder's right to liquidated damages in the form of additional interest shall be its sole remedy in the event of a registration default.
Holders of Exchange Notes will be required to deliver a questionnaire with certain information to be used in connection with the shelf registration statement. In order to sell Exchange Notes and related guarantees pursuant to the shelf registration statement, a holder must complete and deliver the questionnaire to the Borrower. To be named as a selling securityholder in the related prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the shelf registration statement, a holder must complete and deliver the questionnaire to the Borrower on or prior to the tenth business day before the effectiveness of the shelf registration statement.
Upon receipt of a completed questionnaire after effectiveness of the shelf registration statement, together with any other information the Borrower may reasonably request, the Borrower will, within 15 business days of such receipt, or within 15 business days of the end of any period during which the Borrower has suspended use of the prospectus, file any amendments to the shelf registration statement or supplements to the related prospectus as are necessary to permit such
holder to deliver a prospectus to purchasers of Exchange Notes and related guarantees sold pursuant to the shelf registration statement; provided, however, that the Borrower will not be required to file any such amendment or supplement on more than one occasion per calendar quarter.
If a holder does not timely complete and deliver a questionnaire or provide such other information the Borrower may request, the holder will not be named as a selling security holder in the prospectus (and therefore will not be permitted to sell any securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement) and will not be entitled to any of the liquidated damages described above.
Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture or this Annex I to the contrary, if the Borrower determines that any Registrable Securities of any holder issued under the Exchange Notes Indenture are eligible for a registered exchange offer in reliance on the position of the SEC in (pub. avail. May 13, 1988) and . (pub. avail. June 5, 1991) in lieu of registering such Registrable Securities of such holder pursuant to a shelf registration statement, the Borrower may, without the consent of any holder of the Exchange Notes, cause the Indenture to be amended in order to provide for customary provisions allowing the issuance of exchange notes identical in all material respects to the Exchange Notes (except that such new exchange notes shall not provide for registration rights or liquidated damages) in such exchange offer and may perform a registered exchange offer for such Registrable Securities on customary terms pursuant to procedures to be reasonably agreed upon with the Arrangers. The Exchange Offer Registration Rights Agreement will provide that in connection with an exchange offer, the Borrower and the Guarantors will, at their expense, file an exchange offer registration statement prior to or on the 90th day after the earliest date of original issuance of any of the Exchange Notes, use reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective prior to or on the 180th day after the earliest date of original issuance of any of the Exchange Notes and use reasonable best efforts to consummate the exchange offer prior to or on the 220th day after the earliest date of original issuance of any of the Exchange Notes. Additional interest for failure to meet any such deadline will accrue as set forth above.

We have acted as counsel to Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), and certain of its subsidiaries, in connection with (i) that certain Interim Loan Agreement dated as of June 28, 2012 (the ""), among the Borrower, the Lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the ""), and the other parties from time to time party thereto, providing for, among other things, extensions of credit to be made by the Lenders to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $1,875,000,000, and (ii) the various agreements and documents referred to in the next following paragraph. As such counsel, we have been requested to render this opinion pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Interim Loan Agreement. Except where indicated, capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Interim Loan Agreement.
Borrower
Interim Loan Agreement
Administrative Agent
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the following agreements, instruments and other documents:
 
 
 
 
The Interim Loan Agreement, the Notes, and the Guarantee Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the "".
Credit Documents
In rendering this opinion, we have made such examination of laws as we have deemed relevant for the purposes hereof. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion,
 
 
we have relied upon representations and/or certificates of officers of the Obligors, certificates and documents issued by public officials and authorities, and information received from searches of public records.
With respect to the opinions set forth in paragraph 1 hereof, such opinions are based solely on certificates of the appropriate state agencies from the states set forth on as of the dates set forth on such certificates and are limited to the meaning ascribed to such certificates by each such applicable state agency.
Annex 1
Whenever in this opinion reference is made to matters of which we have knowledge, such knowledge is based solely upon (i) information obtained from the documents, certificates and other matters referred to above, (ii) responses of the appropriate officers of the Borrower to inquiries with respect to their present recollection as to such matters, and (iii) review of documents in our files to which we have given substantive attention in the course of our representation of the Borrower and the Guarantors. We will not accept any liability whatsoever for any imputed knowledge regarding such matters or any matters about which we should have known except as noted above.
Based upon and in reliance on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions and qualifications hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:
1.       Each Obligor is a corporation or limited liability company duly incorporated or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation as indicated on hereto. Each Obligor is qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation under the laws of each state set forth on hereto.
Annex 1
Annex 1
2.       Each Obligor has the corporate or limited liability company power and authority to own its properties and transact the business in which it is currently engaged, and to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the Credit Documents to which it is a party.
3.       Each Obligor's execution and delivery of, and its performance of its obligations under, the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and the Borrower's borrowings under the Interim Loan Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Obligor.
4.       Each Obligor has duly executed and delivered each Credit Document to which it is a party.
5.       The Credit Documents to which any Obligor is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against such Obligor in accordance with its terms.
6.       No authorization, approval or consent of, and no filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority or agency of the United States of America, the State of New York, the State of Delaware or the State of California ("") is required on
Filing or Approval
 
 
the part of any Obligor for the execution, delivery or performance by any Obligor of any of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, or for the Borrower's borrowings under the Interim Loan Agreement, except for any Filing or Approval which has previously been made or obtained and is in full force and effect on the date hereof and any Filing or Approval required to be made after the date hereof.
7.       Each Obligor's execution and delivery of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and the performance of its obligations thereunder, do not on this date (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, articles of organization, by-laws or operating agreement, as applicable, of such Obligor; (ii) result in a breach of any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets of such Obligor pursuant to the indentures and other agreements listed on hereto, (iii) to our knowledge, violate any existing judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to such Obligor or any of its respective properties, or (iv) violate any existing federal, New York, Delaware or California statute, rule, regulation or ordinance which in our experience is normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Credit Documents.
Annex 2
8.       None of the Obligors is required to be registered as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9.       Neither the making of the Loans under the Interim Loan Agreement, nor the application of the proceeds thereof on the date hereof as provided in the Interim Loan Agreement, will violate Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications and limitations and are based upon the following further assumptions:
(i)       We have assumed, without any investigation, with respect to each party thereto other than the Obligors, (a) the full capacity, power and authority of such party to execute, deliver and perform the Credit Documents, (b) the due execution and delivery of the Credit Documents by such party, and (c) the legality, validity and binding effect of the Credit Documents as against such party.
(ii)       We have assumed without any investigation the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic or telestatic copies, and the authenticity and completeness of originals of such copies. We have also assumed, without investigation, that the representations and warranties as to factual matters of each of the Obligors in the Credit Documents are true and correct.
 
 
(iii)       The enforceability of provisions in the Credit Documents to the effect that the terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be limited in certain circumstances.
(iv)       The enforceability of the Guarantee Agreement and Section 9.03 of the Interim Loan Agreement (and any similar provisions in any of the other Credit Documents) may be limited by laws rendering unenforceable (a) indemnification contrary to federal or state securities laws and the public policy underlying such laws, and (b) the release of a party from, or the indemnification of a party against, liability for its own wrongful or negligent acts under certain circumstances.
(v)        We express no opinion as to (a) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) in which any Lender or the Administrative Agent is located that limit the interest, fees or other charges such Lender or Administrative Agent may impose, and (b) Section 9.09(b) of the Interim Loan Agreement (and any similar provisions in any of the other Credit Documents), insofar as such Section relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Documents.
(vi)       To the extent title to any property is required to be held by any party in order to perform its obligations under any of the Credit Documents, we have assumed without any investigation that such party holds title adequate to perform its obligations.
(vii)      The foregoing opinions are subject to the effect of (a) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and/or similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, including without limitation fraudulent conveyance provisions under applicable laws, and (b) equitable limitations (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and public policy limitations relating to principles of good faith and fair dealing. The foregoing opinions are also subject to the qualification that certain provisions contained in the Credit Documents may not be enforceable, but (subject to the limitations as set forth elsewhere herein) such unenforceability will not render the Credit Documents invalid as a whole or substantially interfere with realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby. Finally, we wish to point out that provisions of the Credit Documents which permit the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take action or make determinations, or to benefit from indemnities and similar undertakings of the Obligors, may be subject to a requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made, and that any action or inaction by the Administrative Agent or any Lender which may give rise to a request for payment under such an undertaking be taken or not taken, on a reasonable basis and in good faith.
(viii)     We express no opinion herein as to (a) whether any borrowing evidenced by the Credit Documents is usurious under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, (b) the effect of any land use or environmental law, rule, regulation or ordinance, (c) the validity or enforceability of any provision of any of the Credit Documents which might be construed as a waiver of counterclaims, and (d) the Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' right to collect any payment due to the extent that such payment constitutes a penalty or forfeiture.
 
 
(ix)      We express no opinion as to the applicability to the obligations of the Guarantors (or the enforceability of such obligations) of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision of law relating to fraudulent conveyances, transfers or obligations.
(x)       We express no opinion with respect to any law, regulation or order of any jurisdiction or agency or tribunal thereof with respect to the manufacture, sale, distribution or control of alcoholic beverages.
(xi)      We further express no opinion with respect to the effect of any law other than (i) the law of the State of New York, (ii) the General Corporation Law and Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware, (iii) the Federal law of the United States, and (iv), the California General Corporation Law, irrespective of any choice of law provisions which may be contained in any of the Credit Documents. In this regard, we note that some of the Obligors are incorporated or organized in jurisdictions other than New York, Delaware or California. Accordingly, for purposes of the opinions rendered in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, above, we have assumed, with your permission, that the laws governing corporations or other entities in the jurisdiction where such Obligors are incorporated or organized are the same in all applicable respects as the laws of the State of New York.
(xii)     We wish to point out that (a) a New York statute provides that a judgment rendered by a court of the State of New York in respect of an obligation denominated in any currency other than Dollars would be rendered in such other currency and would be converted into Dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on date of entry of such judgment, and (b) a judgment rendered by a United States Federal court in the State of New York in respect of the obligation dominated in a currency other than Dollars may be expressed in Dollars (provided that we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply).
(xiii)     We express no opinion with respect to compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, except as expressly set forth in paragraph 8 above or Regulations T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, except as expressly set forth in paragraph 9 above.
This opinion is rendered solely to the addressees and is intended solely for the benefit of the addressees and their assigns and may not be relied upon, referred to or otherwise used by the addressees for any other purposes, or by any other Person other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Interim Loan Agreement without, in each instance, our prior written consent. The opinions expressed herein are rendered as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any undertaking to advise you of changes in law or fact which may affect the continued correctness of any of our opinions as of a later date.
Very truly yours,

(b) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms.
2.1
Guarantee
(a) Each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Obligations.
(b) Anything herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of the Obligations shall in no event exceed the amount which can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable federal and state laws relating to the insolvency of debtors (after giving effect to the right of contribution established in Section 2.2).
(c) Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the amount of the liability of such Guarantor hereunder without impairing the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or affecting the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder.
(d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full force and effect until all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification and contingent expense reimbursement obligations) of each Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been satisfied by payment in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
(e) Except as provided in Section 4.14, no payment made by any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations or any payment received or collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Obligations), remain liable for the Obligations up to the maximum liability of such Guarantor hereunder until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
2.2 . Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent that a Guarantor shall have paid more than its proportionate share of any payment made hereunder, such Guarantor shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against any other Guarantor hereunder which has not paid its proportionate share of such payment. Each Guarantor's right of contribution shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.3.

istrative Agent and the Lenders, and each Guarantor shall remain liable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for the full amount guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder.
2.3. Notwithstanding any payment made by any Guarantor hereunder or any set-off or application of funds of any Guarantor by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, no Guarantor shall seek to enforce any right of subrogation in respect of any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor or any guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek any contribution or reimbursement from any other Guarantor in respect of payments made by such Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Loan Parties on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing agreement by the Guarantor shall operate as a waiver of any subrogation rights.
No Subrogation
2.4 . To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof, or any guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Administrative Agent (or the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem reasonably advisable from time to time, and any guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.
Amendments, etc., with Respect to the Obligations

Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional
 
waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon any of the Guarantors with respect to the Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee contained in this Section 2, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or (c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Guarantor or any other Person or against any guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any such guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any other Guarantor or any other Person or any such guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
2.6 . The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
Reinstatement
2.7 s. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments hereunder will be paid in Dollars to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim at the Administrative Agent's Office.
Payment

(b) this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms;
(c) the making and performance of this Agreement does not and will not violate the provisions of any applicable law, regulation or order, and does not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any consent under, any material agreement, instrument, or document to which it is a party or by which it or any of its property may be bound or affected, except to the extent that such violation or default could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and
(d) all consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations of, and filings and registrations with, any governmental authority required under applicable law and regulations for the making and performance of this Agreement have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, except where the failure of which to obtain or make could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Amendments in Writing
4.2 . All notices, requests and demands to or upon the Administrative Agent or any Guarantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner provided for in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement; that any such notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantors shall be addressed to such Guarantor c/o Constellation Brands, Inc. at its address provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices
provided
4.3   .
No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement
(a) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section 4.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law.
 
(b) By its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each Lender agrees that this Agreement may be enforced only by the Administrative Agent and that no Lender shall have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce this Agreement.
4.4. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Guarantor and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their permitted successors and assigns; provided that no Guarantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement except as permitted by the Credit Agreement.

4.5 . If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final and in whatever currency denominated) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the Obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
Set-Off

Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

NEWS RELEASE
09
 
 Constellation Brands, Inc., (NYSE:STZ), which currently owns 50 percent of Crown Imports LLC (Crown), a 50-50 joint venture with Grupo Modelo S.A.B. de C.V. (Modelo), announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (AB InBev) to purchase the remaining 50 percent interest in Crown as AB InBev completes its proposed acquisition of Modelo. The purchase price is $1.85 billion and represents 50 percent of a multiple of approximately 8.5 times Crown's EBIT. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close during the first quarter of calendar 2013.
VICTOR, N.Y., June 29, 2012
"This is a significant milestone in the history of Constellation Brands," said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer, Constellation Brands. "We have been the importer, marketer and seller of the Modelo brands in the U.S. for almost two decades. During this time, the Crown team has successfully built the Modelo portfolio into an enviable position of leadership and growth. Our full ownership of this significant beer business provides an additional strategic lever for driving overall profitable organic growth. We expect this transaction to dramatically enhance the financial profile of our company and it will solidify
Constellation Brands' position as the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol and the third largest total beverage alcohol company in the U.S."
Crown's portfolio of brands includes Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo and Victoria. Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the sixth best-selling beer overall in the industry. Corona Light is the leading imported light beer and Modelo Especial is the third largest and one of the fastest growing major imported beer brands.
"Crown is currently experiencing significant marketplace momentum driven by new products as well as innovation in advertising, marketing, promotions and packaging," Sands added.
"This agreement provides certainty and continuity for Crown and its wholesaler partners," said Bill Hackett, president, Crown Imports. "We look forward to continuing to work with our wholesaler network to further grow the Modelo portfolio of brands across the U.S. marketplace."
Under the terms of the transaction, Constellation Brands and Crown will have complete, independent control of distribution, marketing and pricing for all Modelo brands in the U.S., while AB InBev will ensure continuity of supply, quality of products and the ability to introduce innovations. The new importation agreement will be perpetual and provides AB InBev with the right, but not the obligation, to exercise a call option every 10 years, subject to regulatory approval, at a multiple of 13 times Crown's EBIT from the Modelo brands.
Financial Highlights
Constellation Brands has fully committed bridge financing in place to complete the acquisition. Permanent financing is expected to consist of a combination of revolver borrowings, a new term loan under the company's current senior credit facility and the issuance of senior notes.
"Upon closing, this transaction is expected to increase Constellation's debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage to the mid-four times range when factoring in a full-year of the additional Crown EBITDA," said Bob Ryder, chief financial officer, Constellation Brands. "Due to the anticipated strong free cash flow generation of Constellation Brands, this leverage ratio should decrease to our targeted range of three to four times within the first 12 months after the close
 
of the transaction. We plan to suspend our current share repurchase program. We currently have approximately $700 million remaining under our one billion share repurchase authorization."
During Constellation's fiscal 2012, Crown sold 164 million cases and generated $2.47 billion of net sales and $431 million of operating income. The company currently accounts for its 50 percent interest in Crown under the equity method and recognized $215 million of equity earnings from Crown in fiscal 2012. Upon completion of the transaction, the company will begin consolidating the full financial results of Crown. As a result, this transaction is expected to be significantly accretive to Constellation's on-going diluted EPS and free cash flow results.
Constellation Brands will discuss this transaction on its first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call scheduled for today at 10:30 a.m. (eastern.) The conference call can be accessed by dialing +973-935-8505 beginning 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.
