Exhibit 99.1        
               
Those statements made during the course of this presentation that are not historical facts (including but not limited to mid-cycle projections) are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions by Sunoco concerning future conditions, any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and necessarily involve risks that may affect Sunoco's business prospects and performance, causing actual results to differ  materially from those discussed during the presentation.  Such risks and uncertainties include, by way of example and not of limitation: general business and economic conditions; competitive products and pricing; changes in refining, chemical and other product margins; variation in petroleum-based commodity prices and availability of crude oil supply or transportation; fluctuations in supply of feedstocks and demand for products manufactured; changes in operating conditions and costs; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation spending; potential equipment malfunction; potential labor relations problems; the legislative or regulatory environment; plant construction/repair delays, non-performance by major customers, suppliers or other business partners; and political and economic conditions including the impact of potential terrorist acts   and international hostilities.  These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Sunoco's Second Quarter Form  10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2003.  Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.  All forward- looking statements included in this presentation are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements.
      Sunoco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.

Strategy
(1) Strategy has been consistent and we've done      what we said we would do.
get more from existing assets volume and efficiency gains in every business
opportunistically grow and/or repurchase shares since 12/31/99, asset growth of 30% and have returned $740 MM to shareholders as of June 30, 2003
maintain financial strength and flexibility through industry downturns while growing the company
Performance
(2) Our financial and operating performance has been  
      improving and superior to peers in many key
      measures
ROCE of 12% for 1997 - 2003 YTD
share price up 70% since 12/31/99
Outlook
(3) The macro-outlook for our businesses is       favorable -- and we can do more with our existing       asset portfolio.    
Refining supply / demand tightening and increasing complexity to manufacture and distribute
Chemicals fundamentals improving industry utilization rates, prices, and margins increasing
2003 transactions (Equistar, Speedway, and (pending) Eagle Point) significantly increase earnings power
Goal
Higher share price

operating changes
reduction in gasoline pool
potential refinery closures
MTBE removal from gasoline pool volume loss and added complexity
New Source Review consent decrees
High natural gas prices have led to fuel switching and improved refining margins . . . particularly in N.E.
Clean Fuels Investment Lower Than Most
Less spending . . . and later

Our View on Being a Sweet Crude Refiner
Sweet crude production is increasing while demand is declining
Sweet crude spot traded vs. sour term contract sales . . . enhances trading and optimization opportunity
Scale advantages for Sunoco in buying and transporting
Lower base refining capital employed . . . lower investment for Clean Fuels . . . average Sunoco Refining & Supply ROCE of 14 % for 1999 - 2003
This is what we are - - and we don't see this as a competitive disadvantage
Our View on Refining Geography
Our refineries tend to be located at the "end of the pipe" . . . in the market
Our geographies tend to be under-supplied . . . requiring imports to meet demand
Significant regional differences - - but still a global commodity
On average, NE crack should be about $1 / B (transportation) above the Gulf Coast; mid- continent should about equal Gulf Coast
Our View on Refining
Long-term:
Do not believe our specific geography or crude slate is disadvantaged - - depends more on how well you operate and optimize
Summary
"Five Finger" focus is working . . . continued substantive progress expected
Margins will continue to be volatile and cyclical . . .         but may continue to be above historical mid-cycle for the next few years
Future focused on more from existing assets . . . and opportunistic acquisitions
We expect to continue to provide attractive returns over the foreseeable future
Retail Marketing
Bob Owens
Has Provided Excellent Return for Sunoco
Averaged $70 MM NIAT and 14 % ROCE for 6 year period (1997- 2002) . . .
2002 exception year . . . Lagged persistent crude oil and wholesale gasoline price increases throughout most of year
2003-to-date . . . $46 MM NIAT in 1H03
Margin History / Outlook
Competitive pressures continue . . ..         but margins will continue to provide attractive return opportunities
U.S. Northeast market attractive
strong Brand
portfolio management
What We Have Done
Re-imaged and grown our portfolio over past 6+ years
net increase of over 800 retail sites
increased annual gasoline sales volumes by approximately 1.2 billion gallons
added more than 300 c-stores
Expanded geography and purchased 190 high quality Speedway sites in June, 2003
Participated in new trends . . e.g. Wal-Mart (Optima)
Aggressive portfolio management . . . e.g. Mid-America program should yield approximately $50 MM in proceeds with net volume gain (to distributor channel)
What We Will Do
Maintain strength of Brand . . . e.g. NASCAR
Aggressively manage portfolio particularly where long-term trends are inadequate or alternative market values are superior to continued Sunoco investment
Add high-quality assets . . . if geography, timing and price are right
High-grade the portfolio

Polypropylene advantaged over other polymers due to:
feedstock cost
inherent properties . . . substitution
point on utilization curve

10 % . . . Middle East expansion light feed ethylene based
Natural gas direct impact minimal . . . threat to U.S. competitiveness and economic growth  
Key Issues: Polypropylene
Sunoco is largest manufacturer in N.A. . . . excellent feedstock integration

Natural gas has direct impact on Haverhill plant fuel costs
Phenol lagging on utilization curve, additional rationalization probable
Key Issues: Phenol
Low cost operator
Scale - high capacity utilization
Optimize:  logistics and raw materials
Willing to rationalize
Use technology for business gain/   competitive advantage
Sunoco Business Model

Sunoco Chemicals Employee Productivity
Top tier assets:  commodity focus
Industry utilization rates increasing
Improving margin trend
Major risks:
Raw material volatility
Economic stagnation
Potential to earn $1.25 - 2.00 EPS annually for Sunoco in 2004 - 2005 and generate significant free cash flow
