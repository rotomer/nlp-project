EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Sunoco, Inc
1801 Market Street
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103-1699
 
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, January 13, 2004Sunoco, Inc. said today that it has closed its previously announced acquisition of the Eagle Point refinery in Westville, NJ from El Paso Corporation. The purchase price was $111 million plus certain assumed liabilities and $138 million for inventories at closing. The acquisition increases Sunoco's total refinery processing capacity by 20 percent to 880,000 barrels per day.
 
Sunoco expects the transaction will be significantly accretive to earnings. It estimates the Eagle Point refinery should earn approximately $65 million after-tax annually based on average 2000-03 refining margins, including immediate Sunoco synergies of approximately $30 million pre tax. Tier II regulatory capital spending requirements for gasoline and diesel is estimated at $100 million for the facility.
 
Sunoco also announced today that it expected fourth-quarter 2003 net income would be in the range of $.50 to $.60 per share. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by significant planned maintenance at its Philadelphia, PA refinery and weakening margins at the end of the quarter. Results also included certain charges for environmental incidents that occurred in prior years. The company's actual results will be reported and further detailed on January 22, 2004.
 
"We are pleased to have completed the Eagle Point refinery acquisition," said Sunoco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John G. Drosdick. "This facility is a logical and low-cost addition to our Northeast Refining complex. As part of our refining system, Eagle Point offers significant synergy and improvement opportunities both immediate and longer-term. We are ready to integrate Eagle Point into Sunoco and expect it to be a significant contributor in 2004 and beyond."
