PHILADELPHIA, January 22, 2004  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $36 million ($.47 per share diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $61 million ($.79 per share diluted) for the 2002 fourth quarter.
 
The fourth quarter 2003 results included a $17 million after-tax charge related to the pending sale of the Chemical's plasticizers business and a $9 million after-tax gain from Retail Marketing's sales of service stations in the Midwest. Included in the fourth quarter 2002 results was a $5 million after-tax charge associated with asset write-downs. Excluding these special items, income for the fourth quarter of 2003 amounted to $44 million ($.57 per share diluted) versus income of $66 million ($.86 per share diluted).
 
For the full year 2003, Sunoco reported net income of $312 million ($4.03 per share diluted) versus a net loss of $47 million ($.62 per share diluted) for the prior year. Excluding special items, Sunoco's income for the full year 2003 was $335 million ($4.32 per share diluted) versus a loss of $25 million ($.33 per share diluted) for 2002.
 
The Company also announced a 2004 capital spending plan of $750 million, excluding acquisition outlays. Non-acquisition related capital spending totaled $425 million in 2003.
 
 
SUNOCO 4Q03 EARNINGS, PAGE 2
 
"Our fourth quarter results, while not as robust as earlier quarters, finished off a strong year for Sunoco," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and CEO. "Refining and Supply earned $20 million for the quarter and $261 million for the full year 2003. Operating performance in our refineries, while limited by significant planned maintenance in the fourth quarter, continued to be strong. On an annual basis, we increased our total production for the third consecutive year. Although refining margins declined during the quarter, the market for 2003 was excellent and the outlook for 2004 remains favorable.
 
"Our Chemicals and Retail Marketing businesses earned $26 million and $25 million, respectively, for the quarter, up sharply from the prior-year period. Results for the full year 2003 were also much improved. Looking ahead, we expect increased contributions from these businesses. We consider this portfolio diversity to be a significant strength of the Company.
 
"Our Coke business earned $11 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged from the year-ago period. Logistics had a loss of $3 million in the current quarter as a result of $11 million of after-tax charges for litigation associated with pipeline spills that occurred in prior years.
 
"For the full year, excluding special items, we earned $335 million ($4.32 per diluted share). Over the past year, we have added significant new growth to our Refining and Supply, Retail Marketing and Chemicals businesses. Our 2004 results are expected to benefit significantly from a full-year contribution from these assets. We also expect to grow our Logistics and Coke businesses. Logistics assets from the Eagle Point purchase will be offered for sale to Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. We have also begun construction of a $140 million coke plant in Haverhill, Ohio, which we expect to be in production by March 2005.
 
"In addition to growing our asset base, we increased our dividend by ten percent and repurchased 2.9 million shares ($136 million) in the recently completed quarter. We ended the year with $431 million of cash, a net debt-to-capital ratio of 40 percent and a stronger balance sheet than a year ago. This combination of opportunistic asset growth and returning cash to the shareholders while remaining prudently leveraged is the core of our strategy to enhance shareholder value."

DETAILS OF FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $20 million in the current quarter versus $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline was largely due to lower production volumes and realized margins in the Northeast refining system. Higher expenses, including fuel costs and depreciation, also contributed to the decrease in earnings.
 
Production decreased in the Northeast due to a planned maintenance turnaround in November which reduced total production by approximately 5 million barrels. Excluding this scheduled downtime, crude unit throughput averaged approximately 500,000 barrels per day (99 percent utilization) in the Northeast. At Sunoco's Toledo refinery, total production averaged over 167,000 barrels per day, a new quarterly record.
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing earned $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The increase in earnings was due largely to higher retail gasoline margins, which were up three cents per gallon compared to the prior-year quarter. Partially offsetting the increased margins were higher expenses, including additional expenses associated with the sites acquired from Speedway in June 2003.
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $17 million in the prior-year period. Average realized margins were 8.7 cents per pound, up over 1 cent per pound versus the prior-year quarter due largely to higher polypropylene margins. Higher sales volumes, which were up 5 percent versus the prior-year quarter, also contributed to the increase in earnings. Partially offsetting this improvement were higher depreciation and fuel expenses.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Sunoco's Logistics segment, which is comprised of Sunoco's 75-percent interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) and certain other assets and joint venture interests, had a loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $7 million of income in the prior-year period. The current period results include $11 million of after-tax charges for litigation associated with two pipeline spills that occurred in prior years.
 
SUNOCO 4Q03 EARNINGS, PAGE 4
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The decline was primarily due to lower benefits from tax credits, partially offset by higher coal and coke margins.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $11 million after tax in the current quarter versus $5 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, including pension and performance-related incentive compensation.
 
Net financing expenses were $24 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2003 versus $25 million in the prior-year quarter.
 
SPECIAL ITEMS
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 included a $17 million after-tax charge for the write-down of the plasticizer business and a $9 million after-tax gain from the sale of service stations in the Midwest. The service station sales generated proceeds of $46 million in the fourth quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2002 included a $5 million after-tax charge related to asset write-downs associated with the shutdown of a pipeline in Syracuse, NY and a related refined products terminal and a 140 million pounds-per-year aniline and diphenylamine (chemicals) production unit in Haverhill, Ohio.
 
TWELVE MONTH RESULTS
 
Sunoco had net income of $312 million for the full year 2003 versus a net loss of $47 million in the comparable 2002 period.
 
In addition to the fourth quarter special items mentioned above, full year results for 2003 include a $15 million after-tax charge associated with the write-down of a joint venture MTBE production facility. Results for the full year 2002 also included $17 million of after-tax charges for asset write-downs and charges related to the shutdown of a polypropylene line at the La Porte, TX plant and certain processing units at the Toledo refinery and a loss provision related to a lawsuit associated with the Puerto Rico refinery, which was divested in December 2001.
 
 
SUNOCO 4Q03 EARNINGS, PAGE 5
 
Excluding these special items, Sunoco earned $335 million for the full year 2003 versus a loss of $25 million in the comparable 2002 period. The increase in earnings was primarily due to significantly higher margins in the Refining and Supply, Retail Marketing and Chemicals business units. Higher refined product sales volumes also contributed to the improved results. Partially offsetting these increases were higher expenses across the Company, primarily fuel, utility costs and employee-related expenses and higher net financing expenses.
 
CAPITAL SPENDING
 
Sunoco's 2004 capital program (excluding acquisition capital) of $750 million includes: $297 million for base spending, $103 million for refinery turnarounds, $175 million for spending associated with meeting clean fuels gasoline specifications, $112 million towards construction of the Haverhill, Ohio, coke plant and $63 million for various other income-improvement projects. These amounts include spending for the recently acquired Eagle Point refinery.
 
In addition to normal infrastructure and maintenance capital requirements, base spending includes several economic return projects to upgrade Sunoco's existing asset base. These projects include $70 million for new processing equipment, boilers and reinstrumentation projects at the Company's refineries and $23 million for additional investments to upgrade Sunoco's existing retail network and enhance its APlus convenience store presence. Base spending also includes $11 million to complete conversion of the Speedway sites acquired in 2003 to Sunoco branded outlets.
 
With respect to clean fuels spending, the Company estimates that total capital outlays to comply with the Tier II gasoline and diesel specifications will be in the range of $400-$500 million, including amounts attributable to the Eagle Point refinery. The Company expects that most of this spending will occur through 2006. Through year-end 2003, the Company's Tier II spending totaled $25 million. The Company plans to meet the new gasoline specifications with new gasoline hydrotreaters at its Marcus Hook, Philadelphia, Toledo and Eagle Point facilities. Spending in 2004 will include continued engineering and construction work associated with these efforts.
 
The income-improvement projects include capital for refinery projects including expenditures to restart an alkylation unit at the Philadelphia refinery and for various catalytic cracker upgrades
 
SUNOCO 4Q03 EARNINGS, PAGE 6
 
and energy projects. It also includes capital for new retail units and for production upgrades in certain chemicals facilities.
 
Sunoco's 2003 capital spending totaled $425 million. Expenditures included $284 million for base infrastructure and maintenance, $88 million for refinery turnarounds, $23 million for spending related to Tier II Clean Fuels, and $30 million for various income-improvement projects. Base infrastructure spending included $50 million related to construction of a new sulfur plant at Sunoco's Marcus Hook refinery.
 
Sunoco, Inc., headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of petroleum and petrochemical products. With 890,000 barrels per day of refining capacity, over 4,500 retail sites selling gasoline and convenience items, interests in almost 11,000 miles of domestic crude oil and refined product pipelines and 33 product terminals, Sunoco is one of the largest independent refiner-marketers in the United States. Sunoco has a strong presence in petrochemicals with approximately six billion pounds of annual sales, largely chemical intermediates used in the manufacture of fibers, plastics, film and resins. Utilizing a proprietary technology, Sunoco also manufactures two million tons annually of high-quality blast furnace coke for use in the steel industry.
 
Anyone interested in obtaining further insights into this quarter's results can monitor the Company's quarterly teleconference call, which is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. ET today (January 22, 2004). It can be accessed through Sunoco's Web site www.SunocoInc.com. It is suggested that you visit the site prior to the teleconference to ensure that you have downloaded any necessary software.
 
NOTE: In this earnings release, Sunoco has provided income (loss) before special items in addition to net income (loss) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This non-GAAP financial measure is used by Sunoco management to evaluate financial and operating performance as the special items are not directly related to operating results for the period. It also facilitates comparisons to prior-period financial results and to the results of the Company's competitors. The measure is also comparable to earnings forecasts made by securities analysts and others, which generally exclude special items as they are difficult to predict in advance. A reconciliation of income before special items to GAAP net

income is presented in the Earnings Profile of Sunoco Businesses on pages 9, 10, 17 and 18 in this release. Special items are not allocated to Sunoco's business segments in its consolidated financial statements. Income (loss) before special items should not be considered a substitute for net income (loss).
 
Those statements made in this release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Sunoco believes that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and necessarily involve risks that may affect Sunoco's business prospects and performance causing actual results to differ from those discussed in the foregoing release. Such risks and uncertainties include, by way of example and not of limitation: general business and economic conditions; competitive products and pricing; changes in refining, chemical and other product margins; variation in petroleum-based commodity prices and availability of crude oil supply or transportation; fluctuations in supply of feedstocks and demand for products manufactured; changes in operating conditions and costs; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; potential equipment malfunction; potential labor relations problems; the legislative and regulatory environment; plant construction/repair delays; nonperformance by major customers, suppliers or other business partners; and political and economic conditions, including the impact of potential terrorist acts and international hostilities. These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Sunoco's third quarter Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 6, 2003 and in other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sunoco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this release, whether as a result of new information or future events.

Certain revisions to Sunoco's Financial and Operating Statistics have been made to the 2002 amounts to conform to the 2003 presentation. The primary changes provide refinery production volumes (instead of the previously reported sales volumes) and realized refining margin per barrel on the basis of production available for sale (instead of the previously reported sales volumes which included purchase-for-sale activity). More detailed information concerning refining throughputs has also been provided. Additionally, the value of internally produced fuel at Sunoco's refineries and chemical plants, which was previously shown as an operating expense, is now shown as a reduction to realized margins.
