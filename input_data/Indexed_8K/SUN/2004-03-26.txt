This Form 8-K/A amends Item 7 of the Form 8-K of Sunoco, Inc. ("Sunoco") dated January 28, 2004. That Form 8-K reported under Item 2 the acquisition by Sunoco of certain crude oil refining assets and other assets from El Paso Corporation ("El Paso"), pursuant to an Asset Sale Agreement dated December 22, 2003, by and among Coastal Eagle Point Oil Company, Coastal Pipeline Company, and El Paso Merchant EnergyPetroleum Company, as Sellers, and Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) as the Buyer. Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) is a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Sunoco. That Form 8-K also reported under Item 7 that financial statements of the acquired business would be filed by amendment on or before March 29, 2004. As discussed below, Sunoco has subsequently determined that the acquisition is not deemed significant under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and, accordingly, the financial statements related to this acquisition are not required and will not be filed pursuant to Item 7 of Form 8-K.
 
 
Sunoco has determined that:
 
(1) the acquisition of the crude oil refining assets and other assets from El Paso Corporation, as described above, is not a "significant" acquisition as defined in the Instructions to Item 2 of Form 8-K, and in Rules 11-01(b) and (d) of Regulation S-X, promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; and therefore
 
(2) the financial statements (described by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X) and the pro forma financial information (described by Article 11 of Regulation S-X) relating to this acquisition are not required to be filed with the Commission.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
