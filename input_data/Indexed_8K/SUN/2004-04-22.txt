PHILADELPHIA, April 22, 2004  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $89 million ($1.17 per share diluted) for the first quarter of 2004 versus $86 million ($1.12 per share diluted) for the 2003 first quarter.
 
"We are pleased with our first quarter results," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and CEO. "Financially, earnings were slightly better than last year's strong start and, strategically, our activities over the past year are making significant contributions to the Company's earnings.
 
"Our financial performance for the quarter largely reflects strong results from Refining and Supply, which had income of $100 million. Current quarter refining margins were $5.68 per barrel, up slightly from the prior-year level. Stronger gasoline margins more than offset the impact of a weaker distillate market and sharply higher transportation and fuel costs. First quarter 2004 earnings included $23 million from the Eagle Point refinery, acquired January 13, 2004. We have made significant progress in capturing synergies and integrating this facility into our refining system and are pleased with this addition to our asset base. With summer gasoline demand projected to reach record levels, prospects for continued strong refining results through the driving season remain favorable.
 
"Similar to the 2003 first quarter, however, rising crude oil costs substantially squeezed product margins in our Retail Marketing and Chemicals businesses. Retail Marketing lost $4 million, as retail gasoline price increases lagged sharply higher wholesale prices throughout the quarter. Additionally,
 
SUNOCO 1Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 2
 
Chemicals earnings of $12 million for the quarter were much improved from the year-ago loss of $4 million, despite significant increases in benzene and propylene feedstock costs which reduced margins in Chemicals versus more recent quarters. Assuming crude prices level off or moderate, we would expect margins in these businesses to improve, as fundamental product demand growth continues to be fairly strong.
 
"Our other businesses, Logistics and Coke, earned $8 and $9 million, respectively for the quarter."
 
Drosdick added, "We continued to move ahead on other strategic initiatives. We expect to close shortly on our acquisition of retail sites from ConocoPhillips. These high-quality sites will nicely expand and upgrade our retail portfolio network in the mid-Atlantic region. In January, we completed the divestment of our plasticizers operations, generating cash proceeds of $90 million for a business that earned an average of $3 million over the past three years. We sold certain logistics assets associated with the Eagle Point refinery to Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and, in early April, the Partnership completed an equity offering generating net proceeds of approximately $130 million. We now have a 63 percent interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. We also continued our share buyback program, repurchasing 600,000 shares of Sunoco common stock for $37 million during the quarter.
 
"The actions of the past year have included asset growth in each of our five businesses, an increased dividend and significant share repurchase activity. We have funded these activities with strong operating cash flow and targeted portfolio divestments. This strategy of opportunistic and diversified portfolio growth while maintaining prudent financial strength and returning cash to shareholders will continue to guide our actions to increase value for our shareholders."
 
DETAILS OF FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $100 million in the current quarter versus $93 million in the first quarter of 2003. The increase was largely due to the $23 million income contribution from the Eagle Point refinery acquired on January 13, 2004, higher production volumes in the Northeast Refining System and slightly higher realized margins. Partially offsetting these positive variances were higher expenses, including fuel and depreciation, and lower production volumes in Sunoco's MidContinent Refining System due to planned turnaround activity at both the Toledo and Tulsa refineries in March 2004.
 
Total crude unit throughput averaged 825 thousand barrels daily (95 percent utilization) for the quarter, with total production available for sale approximating 80 million barrels.
 
SUNOCO 1Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 3
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing had a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2004 versus income of $10 million in the first quarter of 2003. The decrease in results was due largely to lower retail gasoline margins, which averaged 6.4 cents per gallon and were down almost two cents per gallon from the prior-year quarter. Current quarter results included a $1 million income contribution from the Speedway sites acquired in June 2003.
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $12 million in the first quarter of 2004 versus a loss of $4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was due largely to higher realized margins for phenol and by-products and a $5 million income contribution associated with the 2003 propylene supply agreement with Equistar Chemicals, L.P. and sales from the Bayport, TX polypropylene facility acquired from Equistar. Phenol sales volumes declined from the prior-year quarter as sales were limited by cumene availability issues in the industry. Polypropylene sales volumes (excluding the Bayport facility) declined due to sales from inventory during the prior-year quarter.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Earnings for the Logistics segment were $8 million versus $11 million in the year-ago period. The decline in earnings was due largely to lower results from the Western Crude System and lower joint-venture income.
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $9 million in the first quarter of 2004 versus $10 million in the first quarter of 2003.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $12 million after tax in the current quarter versus $9 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, including accruals associated with stock-based compensation.
 
Net financing expenses were $24 million after tax in the first quarter of 2004 versus $25 million in the prior-year quarter.
