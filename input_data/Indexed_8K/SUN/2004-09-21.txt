Safe Harbor Statement
Those statements made by representatives of Sunoco during the course of this presentation that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions by Sunoco concerning future conditions, any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and necessarily involve risks that may affect Sunoco's business prospects and performance, causing actual results to differ materially from those discussed during this presentation. Such risks and uncertainties include, by way of example and not of limitation: general business and economic conditions; competitive products and pricing; changes in refining, chemical and other product margins; variation in petroleum-based commodity prices and availability of crude oil supply or transportation; fluctuations in supply of feedstocks and demand for products manufactured; changes in operating conditions and costs; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation spending; potential equipment malfunction; potential labor relations problems; the legislative or regulatory environment; ability to identify acquisition candidates, enter into agreement of terms favorable to us and integrate them into our existing businesses, ability to enter into joint ventures and other collaborations with favorable terms, plant construction/repair delays, non-performance by major customers, suppliers or other business partners; and political and economic conditions including the impact of potential terrorist acts and international hostilities. These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Sunoco's Second Quarter 2004 Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 5, 2004. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this presentation are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements.
Sunoco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.
