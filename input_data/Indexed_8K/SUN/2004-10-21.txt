Exhibit 99.1
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, October 21, 2004  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $104 million ($1.39 per share diluted) for the third quarter of 2004 versus $109 million ($1.40 per share diluted) for the 2003 third quarter. Excluding special items, income for the current quarter was $125 million ($1.67 per share diluted) compared to $124 million ($1.59 per share diluted) for the 2003 third quarter.
 
For the first nine months of 2004, Sunoco reported net income of $427 million ($5.63 per share diluted) versus net income of $276 million ($3.56 per share diluted) for the 2003 nine-month period. Excluding special items, Sunoco's income for the first nine months of 2004 was $452 million ($5.96 per share diluted) versus $291 million ($3.75 per share diluted) for the first nine months of 2003.
 
"Results for the Company continued to be strong, with good contributions from each of our businesses this quarter," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We have achieved a record level of earnings during the first nine months of 2004 and the market fundamentals for our businesses continue to be very favorable.
 
"Our Refining and Supply business again led the way with earnings of $89 million despite significant scheduled maintenance activity during the quarter. Margins, particularly for petrochemical feedstocks and for premium gasoline and distillate products, such as low-sulfur diesel and jet fuel, were strong and operating performance across our system continued to be excellent. Excluding planned September maintenance activity in the Northeast Refining System, which reduced total production by approximately five million barrels, our refining system utilization was near capacity levels for the quarter. With no major additional refinery maintenance scheduled this year, we are well-positioned for the upcoming winter-time product demand.
 
SUNOCO 3Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 2
 
"Also contributing significantly to our third quarter results was our Chemicals business, which earned $30 million for the quarter. Year-on-year results for this business have improved for the past six consecutive quarters and this period's results reflect a new quarterly record for Chemicals. With feedstock costs continuing at record high levels, the much improved results are due to substantial sales price increases for our phenol and polypropylene products and reflect the progressively tightening supply and demand for these products. We expect this cyclical recovery to continue."
 
Commenting further on the Company's results, Drosdick said, "Our other businesses also achieved solid results for the quarter. Retail Marketing earned $19 million, a good result considering the run-up in crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices during the quarter. Hurricane activity also negatively impacted results in our Southeast U.S. retail network. Coke and Logistics earned $12 million and $9 million, respectively, in the quarter.
 
"We also continued our share repurchase activity, repurchasing over 2.6 million shares ($171 million) of Sunoco common stock during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.7 million shares ($236 million) and have reduced total shares outstanding to 73.1 million. In September, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million of share repurchase authorization, providing ample authority to continue this program which we believe to be an important element of our strategy to increase shareholder value.
 
"During the quarter, we also issued $250 million of 10-year, 4-7/8 percent notes and repurchased approximately $350 million of various higher-interest-rate debt issues. Annual net interest expense is expected to decline approximately $15 million pretax as a result of these activities. We ended the quarter with $293 million of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio, as defined in our revolving credit agreement, of 38 percent. With our strong balance sheet and a favorable market outlook for our businesses, we should have the financial capacity to continue to pursue disciplined growth across our portfolio while returning cash to our shareholders. This remains core to our success and strategy to increase shareholder value."
 
DETAILS OF THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $89 million in the current quarter versus $98 million in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding results from the Eagle Point refinery, the decrease was largely due to lower realized margins, increased planned maintenance in the Northeast Refining Complex and higher expenses, including fuel, depreciation and employee-related charges. Partially offsetting these factors was a $30 million income contribution from the Eagle Point facility acquired in January 2004.
 
SUNOCO 3Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 3
 
Total crude unit throughput averaged 827.4 thousand barrels daily (93 percent utilization) for the quarter, with total production available for sale approximating 80 million barrels. Scheduled maintenance activity reduced crude unit utilization by six percent for the quarter and reduced total production by approximately five million barrels.
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing earned $19 million in the third quarter of 2004 versus $20 million in the third quarter of 2003. Current quarter results include $5 million of earnings from retail sites acquired from ConocoPhillips in April 2004. However, lower distillate margins, lower gasoline volumes (excluding the ConocoPhillips sites) and the impact of hurricane activity on our Southeast U.S. retail network (estimated at $2 million after tax) reduced results versus the prior-year period. Gasoline margins across our retail portfolio averaged ten cents per gallon for the quarter.
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $30 million in the third quarter of 2004 versus $21 million in the prior-year period. Average margins were 11.4 cents per pound, up almost one cent per pound versus the prior-year quarter and 1.7 cents per pound versus the second quarter of 2004. Margins for both phenol and polypropylene products improved during the quarter due to increased sales prices throughout the product channels. Despite the higher prices, sales volumes increased over four percent versus the second quarter of 2004.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Earnings for the Logistics segment were $9 million for both third quarter periods.
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $12 million in the third quarter of 2004 versus $11 million in the third quarter of 2003. The increase was due primarily to a favorable litigation settlement during the current quarter.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $15 million after tax in the current quarter versus $10 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, including accruals associated with cash and stock-based compensation.
 
SUNOCO 3Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 4
 
Net financing expenses were $19 million after tax in the third quarter of 2004 versus $25 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline was due, in part, to increased capitalized interest and lower expense attributable to the preferential return of third-party investors in Sunoco's cokemaking operations. Lower long-term debt expense and higher portfolio interest income also contributed to lower net financing expenses compared to the year-ago quarter.
 
SPECIAL ITEMS
 
Net income for the third quarter of 2004 included a net after-tax charge of $21 million consisting of:
 
 
 
 
 
Net income for the third quarter of 2003 included a $15 million after-tax charge related to the write-down of the BEF MTBE production facility to its estimated fair value at that time.
 
NINE MONTH RESULTS
 
Sunoco earned $427 million for the first nine months of 2004 versus $276 million in the comparable 2003 period. The increase is primarily due to significantly higher wholesale fuel margins, higher chemical margins, and added income from acquisitions, including the Eagle Point refinery, Speedway and ConocoPhillips retail gasoline sites and the 2003 propylene supply agreement with Equistar Chemicals, L.P. The increase was partially offset by lower retail gasoline margins, higher expenses and a higher effective income tax rate.
 
Sunoco, Inc., headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of petroleum and petrochemical products.

Commencing in the first quarter of 2004, certain revisions have been made to Sunoco's Financial and Operating Statistics presented below. In Refining and Supply, operating data is now provided for the MidContinent Refining Complex (previously, separate data had been provided for the Toledo and Tulsa refineries).
