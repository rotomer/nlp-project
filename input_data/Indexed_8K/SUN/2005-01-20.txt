Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Sunoco, Inc.
1801 Market Street
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103-1699
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, January 20, 2005  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $188 million ($2.62 per share diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $36 million ($.47 per share diluted) for the 2003 fourth quarter. Excluding special items, income for the 2003 fourth quarter was $44 million ($.57 per share diluted). There were no special items in the current quarter.
 
For the full year 2004, Sunoco reported net income of $615 million ($8.21 per share diluted) versus net income of $312 million ($4.03 per share diluted) for the prior year. Excluding special items, Sunoco's income for the full year 2004 was $639 million ($8.53 per share diluted) versus $335 million ($4.32 per share diluted) for 2003.
 
"Our fourth-quarter results were excellent and completed an outstanding year for Sunoco," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We achieved record earnings in 2004 and significantly strengthened our asset portfolio while reducing outstanding shares by 8 percent during the year."
 
Commenting on fourth-quarter results, Drosdick said, "Refining margins and results continued to be exceptional, and with some moderation of crude oil prices, Retail Marketing and Chemicals results also improved and contributed strongly in the quarter.
 
"Refining and Supply earned $135 million in the quarter. Quarterly production was again near capacity levels, despite some cutbacks in the Northeast Refining system caused by a third-party oil spill in the Delaware River in late November. In our Northeast system, we also increased our use of
 
SUNOCO 4Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 2
 
heavy-sweet and high-acid crude oils to approximately five percent of crude runs during the quarter. With discounts to light-sweet crude oils of over $10 per barrel, this contributed substantially to lower crude oil purchase costs and higher net margin realizations for the quarter. We expect to increase the use of these crude oils to approximately 10 percent for the first quarter of 2005.
 
"Chemicals earned a record $40 million for the quarter. Despite continued high feedstock costs, Chemicals results have improved year-on-year for seven consecutive quarters, and over the second-half of 2004 earned $70 million. Product demand growth remains healthy and we expect this cyclical recovery to continue.
 
"Retail Marketing results were also much improved, with earnings of $30 million for the quarter. Retail gasoline margins increased as crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices declined during the quarter. With the strong finish to the year, this business earned $68 million in 2004, a good result given the challenging retail marketing conditions during most of the year. Coke and Logistics earned $10 million and $5 million, respectively, in the quarter.
 
"During the quarter, we also continued our share repurchase activity, repurchasing almost 4.3 million shares ($332 million). For the year, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares ($568 million) and reduced total shares outstanding to 69.3 million. We have remaining share repurchase authorization of $227 million and continue to consider this to be an important element of our strategy to increase shareholder value.
 
"For the full year, excluding special items, earnings were $639 million ($8.53 per diluted share). Both Refining and Supply and Chemicals generated record earnings and, while subject to some demand variables, underlying market fundamentals continue to be favorable. Retail Marketing earnings in 2005 should benefit from a full-year contribution from the retail sites acquired from ConocoPhillips in April 2004 and from improvements associated with initiatives within our company-operated store network.
 
"We expect to continue to grow our Logistics and Coke businesses. In 2004, Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) unit value increased 17 percent and annual cash distributions increased by $0.40 per unit (20%). Acquisition and expansion capital for the year totaled $65 million and a successful equity offering was completed in April 2004. In Coke, we are on schedule to begin production at a new 550,000 ton cokemaking plant in Haverhill, Ohio in March 2005 and construction is underway for a joint-venture plant in Vitria, Brazil that is expected to be operational in 2006. Prospects for continued growth in both businesses remain excellent.
 
SUNOCO 4Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 3
 
"While growing the asset base and repurchasing a significant amount of shares in 2004, we were also able to strengthen our balance sheet during the year. We ended the year with a net debt-to-capital ratio, as defined in our revolving credit agreement, of 37 percent (versus 42 percent at year-end 2003) and reduced anticipated 2005 annual pretax interest expense by approximately $20 million through debt restructuring activities completed in 2004. This strong financial position provides us the flexibility and capacity to continue to prudently pursue our strategies to increase shareholder value in the future."
 
DETAILS OF FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $135 million in the current quarter versus $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase was largely due to higher realized margins, increased production volumes, and a $40 million income contribution from the Eagle Point facility acquired in January 2004. Partially offsetting these results were higher expenses, including fuel, depreciation and employee-related charges.
 
Realized margins averaged $6.42 per barrel for the quarter and were particularly strong for distillate products. Total crude unit throughput averaged 883.6 thousand barrels daily (99 percent utilization) for the quarter, with total production available for sale approximating 85 million barrels. Distillate production was a record 29.5 million barrels during the quarter. The prior-year quarter included planned maintenance activity in the Northeast.
 
Production in the Northeast Refining system was reduced by approximately one million barrels during the quarter due to delays in crude oil deliveries caused by the third-party oil spill on the Delaware River. Including crude demurrage and other costs, the loss to Sunoco associated with this incident is estimated to be approximately $15-$20 million pretax. The Company is pursuing claims for recovery in this matter but the ultimate outcome of the claims is uncertain at this time.
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing earned $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The increase in earnings was due to a $6 million income contribution from the retail sites acquired from ConocoPhillips in April 2004. Gasoline margins across the retail portfolio averaged 11.9 cents per gallon for the quarter.
 
SUNOCO 4Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 4
 
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $26 million in the prior-year period. Average margins were 13.7 cents per pound, up 3.3 cents per pound versus the prior-year quarter and 2.3 cents per pound versus the third quarter of 2004. Margins for both phenol and polypropylene products improved during the quarter due to increased sales prices throughout the product channels. Lower sales volumes and higher fuel expenses partially offset the margin improvement.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Earnings for the Logistics segment were $5 million for the current quarter versus a loss of $3 million in the prior-year period. The fourth quarter of 2003 included an $11 million after-tax charge for litigation associated with two pipeline spills that occurred in prior years. Excluding that charge, earnings declined versus the year-ago quarter primarily due to Sunoco's reduced ownership interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P.
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $17 million after tax in the current quarter versus $11 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, including accruals associated with cash and stock-based compensation. Also contributing to the increase were higher audit fees and costs associated with implementing provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
 
Net financing expenses were $15 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $24 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower interest expense on long-term debt largely related to the 2004 debt restructuring activities and increased capitalized interest.
 
SPECIAL ITEMS
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 included a $17 million after-tax charge for the write-down of the plasticizer business and a $9 million after-tax gain from the sale of service stations in the Midwest.
 
SUNOCO 4Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 5
 
 
TWELVE MONTH RESULTS
 
Sunoco had net income of $615 million for the full year 2004 versus $312 million in 2003. Full year results for 2004 include: a $34 million after-tax loss from the early extinguishment of debt; an $8 million after-tax loss recognized in connection with the sale of the Company's one-third interest in the Belvieu Environmental Fuels ("BEF") MTBE joint venture; and an $18 million gain due to an income tax settlement. Results for the full year 2003 included: the $17 million after-tax charge for the write-down of the plasticizer business; the $9 million after-tax gain from the sale of service stations in the Midwest; and a $15 million after-tax charge associated with the write-down of the BEF joint venture.
 
Excluding these special items, Sunoco earned $639 million for the full year 2004 versus $335 million in 2003. The increase is primarily due to significantly higher wholesale fuel margins, higher chemical margins, higher production of refined products, lower net financing expenses and added income from acquisitions, including the Eagle Point refinery, Speedway and ConocoPhillips retail gasoline sites and the 2003 propylene supply agreement with Equistar Chemicals, L.P. The increase was partially offset by lower retail gasoline margins, higher expenses and a higher effective income tax rate.
 
CAPITAL SPENDING
 
Sunoco's 2005 capital program of $846 million includes: $383 million for base spending; $45 million for refinery turnarounds; $294 million for spending associated with meeting clean fuels gasoline specifications; $17 million to complete construction of the Haverhill, Ohio coke plant; and $107 million for various other income improvement projects.
 
In addition to normal infrastructure and maintenance capital requirements, the $383 million for base spending includes several projects to upgrade Sunoco's existing asset base. These projects include: $19 million to complete the expansion of the sulfur recovery unit at the Eagle Point refinery; $36 million for new processing equipment, boilers, and reinstrumentation projects at the Company's refineries; and $67 million to upgrade Sunoco's retail network, enhance its APlus convenience store presence, and complete the conversion of acquired sites to Sunoco branded outlets.
 
With respect to clean fuels spending, the Company estimates that total capital outlays to comply with the Tier II gasoline and diesel specifications will approximate $550 million. Through year-end 2004, the Company's Tier II spending totaled $233 million. The Company expects that most of this spending will be completed by the end of 2006.
 
The $107 million for income-improvement projects for 2005 includes capital for refinery projects, including expenditures to increase hydrotreater capacity at the Toledo refinery, to restart an alkylation unit at the Philadelphia refinery and to upgrade various catalytic cracker units. Planned spending also includes capital for production upgrades in certain chemical facilities.
 
SUNOCO 4Q04 EARNINGS, PAGE 6
 
Excluding $431 million for acquisitions, Sunoco's 2004 capital spending totaled $832 million. Expenditures included $298 million for base infrastructure and maintenance, $122 million for refinery turnarounds, $208 million for Tier II Clean Fuels, $128 million towards construction of the Haverhill, Ohio coke plant and $76 million for various income-improvement projects.
 
Sunoco, Inc., headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of petroleum and petrochemical products. With 890,000 barrels per day of refining capacity, over 4,800 retail sites selling gasoline and convenience items, over 4,500 miles of crude oil and refined product owned and operated pipelines and 38 product terminals, Sunoco is one of the largest independent refiner-marketers in the United States.
