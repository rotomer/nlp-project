On January 28, 2005, Sunoco, Inc. (the "Company") announced a reduction in fourth quarter and full year earnings, previously stated in the Company's quarterly earnings press release, published on January 20, 2005. As adjusted, net income for the fourth quarter is $178 million ($2.48 per share diluted) and $605 million ($8.08 per share diluted) for the year. The adjustment had no impact on the Company's cash flow. A copy of the Company's January 28, 2005 press release with respect to this matter is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.02.
 
Subsequent to releasing its fourth quarter earnings on January 20, 2005, the Company's independent auditors indicated that the major public accounting firms were reevaluating the appropriateness of the accounting by many companies, including Sunoco, for certain insurance policies issued through an energy industry mutual insurance consortium. After reviewing the matter, the Company concluded that current and future premiums under these insurance policies should be accounted for as retrospective premiums (since they reflect the impact of past claims experience), and the prior accounting treatment should be corrected. As a result, the Company recorded a $10 million after-tax charge in the 2004 fourth quarter for the estimated liability attributable to the retrospective premiums. The Company has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The Company's financial statements in that Annual Report will reflect the revised accounting treatment. No restatement of prior periods was required as the impact on such periods would not have been material.
 
The information in this report, being furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 and 7.01 of Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section, and is not incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
On January 20, 2005, in connection with its quarterly earnings release announcing financial results for the 2004 fourth quarter, the Company conducted a teleconference with investors that included a slide presentation. A new version of that slide presentation, revised to reflect the matters discussed in Item 2.02 (above), is attached as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the revised slides will be posted on the Company's website at www.SunocoInc.com.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Sunoco, Inc.
1801 Market Street
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103-1699
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, January 28, 2005  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today announced that it was reducing its previously published 2004 fourth quarter and full year earnings by $10 million. As adjusted, net income for the fourth quarter is $178 million ($2.48 per share diluted) and $605 million ($8.08 per share diluted) for the year. The adjustment had no impact on the Company's cash flow.
 
Subsequent to releasing its fourth quarter earnings on January 20, 2005, Sunoco was informed by its independent auditors that the major public accounting firms were reevaluating the appropriateness of the accounting by many companies, including Sunoco, for certain insurance policies issued through an energy industry mutual insurance consortium. After completing its own review and discussions with its independent auditors, the Company has concluded that current and future premiums under these insurance policies reflect the impact of past claims experience and, therefore, should be accounted for as retrospective premiums. Accordingly, a correction of the prior accounting treatment utilized by Sunoco was deemed appropriate. Sunoco recorded a $10 million after-tax charge in the 2004 fourth quarter for the estimated liability attributable to retrospective premiums. Sunoco has not yet filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. Sunoco's financial statements in the Annual Report will reflect the revised accounting treatment. No restatement of prior periods was required as the impact on such periods would not have been material.
 
Sunoco, Inc., headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of petroleum and petrochemical products. With 890,000 barrels per day of refining capacity, over 4,800 retail sites selling gasoline and convenience items, over 4,500 miles of crude oil and refined product owned and operated pipelines and 38 product terminals, Sunoco is one of the largest independent refiner-marketers in the United States. Sunoco is a significant manufacturer of petrochemicals with

annual sales of approximately five billion pounds, largely chemical intermediates used to make fibers, plastics, film and resins. Utilizing a unique, patented technology, Sunoco also manufactures approximately two million tons annually of high-quality metallurgical-grade coke for use in the steel industry.
 
Those statements made in this release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Sunoco believes that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and necessarily involve risks that may affect Sunoco's business prospects and performance causing actual results to differ from those discussed in the foregoing release. Such risks and uncertainties include, by way of example and not of limitation: general business and economic conditions; competitive products and pricing; effects of weather conditions and natural disasters on product supply and demand; changes in refining, chemical and other product margins; variation in petroleum-based commodity prices and availability of crude oil supply or transportation; effects of transportation disruptions; changes in the price differentials between light-sweet and heavy-sour crude oils; fluctuations in supply of feedstocks and demand for products manufactured; changes in product specifications; availability and pricing of oxygenates; phase-outs or restrictions on the use of MTBE; changes in operating conditions and costs; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; age of, and changes in, the reliability and efficiency of the Company's or a third party's operating facilities; potential equipment malfunction; potential labor relations problems; the legislative and regulatory environment; ability to identify acquisitions under favorable terms and integrate them into the Company's existing businesses; ability to enter into joint ventures and other arrangements with favorable terms; plant construction/repair delays; nonperformance by major customers, suppliers or other business partners; changes in financial markets impacting pension expense and funding requirements; political and economic conditions, including the impact of potential terrorist acts and international hostilities; and changes in the status of, or initiation of new, litigation. These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Sunoco's Third Quarter 2004 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2004 and in other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sunoco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this release, whether as a result of new information or future events.

Commencing in the first quarter of 2004, certain revisions have been made to Sunoco's Financial and Operating Statistics presented below. In Refining and Supply, operating data is now provided for MidContinent Refining (previously, separate data had been provided for the Toledo and Tulsa refineries). Also, the Chemicals margin and volume data as well as certain other financial information reflect the impact of consolidating the Epsilon Products Company, LLC polypropylene joint venture in connection with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46. The polypropylene margin information also now includes the impact of a long-term supply contract entered into on March 31, 2003 with Equistar Chemicals, L.P. and the cost of additives. Prior-period amounts have been restated to conform to the 2004 presentation.

Safe Harbor Statement
This slide presentation (including the Appendix) is a revision to the presentation made in conjunction with Sunoco's Fourth Quarter 2004 earnings conference call, held on January 20, 2005. This revised presentation reflects a reduction in Sunoco's previously released Fourth Quarter 2004 earnings, resulting from a change in accounting treatment for certain insurance policies issued through an energy industry mutual insurance consortium.
Those statements made by representatives of Sunoco during the course of this conference call that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions by Sunoco concerning future conditions, any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and necessarily involve risks that may affect Sunoco's business prospects and performance, causing actual results to differ materially from those discussed during this conference call. Such risks and uncertainties include, by way of example and not of limitation: general business and economic conditions; competitive products and pricing; effects of weather conditions and natural disasters on product supply and demand; changes in refining, chemical and other product margins; variation in petroleum-based commodity prices and availability of crude oil supply or transportation; effects of transportation disruptions; changes in the price differentials between light-sweet and heavy-sour crude oils; fluctuations in supply of feedstocks and demand for products manufactured; changes in product specifications; availability and pricing of oxygenates; phase-outs or restrictions on the use of MTBE; changes in operating conditions and costs; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; age of, and changes in, the reliability and efficiency of the Company's or a third party's operating facilities; potential equipment malfunction; potential labor relations problems; the legislative and regulatory environment; ability to identify acquisitions under favorable terms and integrate them into the Company's existing businesses; ability to enter into joint ventures and other arrangements with favorable terms; plant construction/repair delays; non-performance by major customers, suppliers or other business partners; changes in financial markets impacting pension expense and funding requirements; political and economic conditions, including the impact of potential terrorist acts and international hostilities; and changes in the status of, or initiation of, new litigation. These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Sunoco's Third Quarter 2004 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2004. Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed herein could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this conference call are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements.
Sunoco undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or future events.
