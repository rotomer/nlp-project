Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, May 5, 2005  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $116 million ($1.67 per share diluted) for the first quarter of 2005 versus $89 million ($1.17 per share diluted) for the 2004 first quarter.
 
"Our first quarter results reflect an excellent start to 2005," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "While Refining and Supply results were up only modestly versus the first-quarter 2004, significantly higher Chemicals earnings, lower net financing expenses and nine percent fewer shares outstanding enabled us to increase earnings per share by 43 percent versus the year-ago quarter. With favorable market conditions entering the driving season, momentum remains positive for the Company."
 
Regarding the first quarter's results, Drosdick said, "Our Refining and Supply business continued to lead the way, earning $108 million for the quarter. Margins, although lower than the 2004 fourth quarter in the Northeast, were still well above historical norms. Our Refining and Supply results also benefited from three percent higher production than last year's first quarter and increased use of discounted high-acid crude oils in Northeast Refining. We have gradually increased our processing of such crudes over the past three quarters and averaged approximately 48,000 barrels per day in the first quarter. With continued strong discounts to light-sweet crude oils, we would expect to process approximately 60,000 - 70,000 barrels per day of high-acid crude oils in the second quarter. Without new units or additional capital, our refining organization has met the challenges of processing these crude oils, improving our refining margins, and increasing our crude oil options for the future.
 
SUNOCO 1Q05 EARNINGS, PAGE 2
 
"Chemicals improved most significantly versus last year's first quarter, earning $33 million versus $12 million a year ago. Despite continued feedstock cost pressures, Chemicals results have improved year-on-year for eight consecutive quarters. Fundamentals remain positive and we expect the recovery to continue.
 
"In other businesses, Retail Marketing lost $8 million, as retail margins could not keep pace with persistently rising wholesale prices, which increased over 40 cents per gallon during the quarter. As we approach the peak driving season, market conditions for this business are improved.
 
"Coke and Logistics earned $10 million and $3 million, respectively, in the quarter. We completed startup of our new coke plant in Haverhill, Ohio in late March. This plant is expected to increase annual Coke earnings by approximately $12 million and provide low-cost steam to our adjacent Chemicals phenol facility. Logistics earnings include a $3 million after-tax charge associated with a pipeline spill on the Mid-Valley crude oil pipeline.
 
"We also continued to act on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our dividend by 33 percent, repurchased 724,500 shares ($70 million) and had our share repurchase authorization increased by $500 million. With a strong balance sheet and a favorable market outlook, we have the financial capacity to continue to invest in our existing assets while opportunistically growing the portfolio and returning cash to our shareholders."
 
DETAILS OF FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $108 million in the current quarter versus $100 million in the first quarter of 2004. The $8 million increase was largely due to higher realized margins and higher production volumes. The first quarter of 2004 included significant scheduled maintenance activity in MidContinent Refining. Partially offsetting these positive variances were higher expenses, including fuel and other energy-related expenditures.
 
Total crude unit throughput averaged 875 thousand barrels daily (97 percent utilization) for the quarter, with total production available for sale approximating 83 million barrels.
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing had a loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 2005 versus a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2004. The decrease in results was due largely to lower retail margins for gasoline and distillate, partially offset by lower expenses. Current quarter results included a $2 million income contribution from the ConocoPhillips sites acquired in April 2004.
 
SUNOCO 1Q05 EARNINGS, PAGE 3
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $33 million in the first quarter of 2005 versus $12 million in the prior-year period. The increase in earnings was due largely to higher realized margins for phenol and polypropylene. Total sales volumes and expenses were largely unchanged versus the year-ago period.
 
LOGISTICS
 
Earnings for the Logistics segment were $3 million versus $8 million in the year-ago period. The decline in earnings was due largely to the $3 million after-tax charge associated with the Mid-Valley pipeline spill and a $2 million unfavorable tax adjustment.
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $10 million in the first quarter of 2005 versus $9 million in the first quarter of 2004.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $16 million after tax in the current quarter versus $12 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, primarily accruals for stock-based incentive compensation.
 
Net financing expenses were $14 million after tax in the first quarter of 2005 versus $24 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from 2004 debt restructuring activities and increased capitalized interest.
