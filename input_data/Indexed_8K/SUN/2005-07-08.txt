On July 7, 2005, the Board of Directors of Sunoco, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (the "Company") adopted amended and restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, effective July 7, 2005. The amended and restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company are being filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on July 8, 2005. The purpose of the amendments, which do not require shareholder approval, is to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200 million to 400 million, in order to effectuate a two-for-one stock split of the Company's common stock. A copy of the Company's amended and restated Articles of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit 3(i).
 
 
On July 7, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend, with holders of record on the record date receiving one additional share of common stock for each share owned. The press release also announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2005 on all full shares of common stock outstanding, payable September 9, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2005. In view of the fact that the stock split will have been completed prior to the record date, the cash dividend for the quarter will be 20 cents per share. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.

The following is a description of each class of capital stock and a statement of the preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, and other special or relative rights granted to or imposed upon the shares of each class:
 
Preference Stock
 
1. . Authority is hereby vested in the Board of Directors, by resolution, to divide any or all of the authorized shares of Preference Stock into series and, within the limitations provided by law and this Article Fourth, to fix and determine the designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, options, conversion rights, and other special rights of each such series, including but not limited to the right to fix and determine:
Authority of Board of Directors
 
(a) the designation of and the number of shares issuable in each such series;
 
(b) the annual dividend rate, expressed in a dollar amount per share, for each such series;
 
(c) the right, if any, of the Corporation to redeem shares of any such series, and the terms and conditions on which shares of each such series may be redeemed;
 
(d) the amounts payable upon shares of each such series in the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation;
 
(e) the sinking fund provisions, if any, for the redemption or purchase of shares of each such series;
 
(f) the voting rights, if any, for the shares of each such series; provided, however, that the number of votes per share of Preference Stock shall in no event exceed one (1);
 
(g) the terms and conditions, if any, on which shares of each such series may be converted into shares of stock of this Corporation; provided, however, that shares of Preference Stock shall not be convertible into shares of any class of stock of the Corporation other than Common Stock and shall not be convertible into more than one share of Common Stock, or such greater or lesser number as will reflect the effect of stock dividends, stock splits or stock combinations affecting Common Stock and occurring after May 9, 1980, subject to such terms and conditions, including provision for fractional shares, as the Board of Directors shall authorize;
 
(h) the stated value per share for each such series; and
 
(i) any and all such other provisions as may be fixed or determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation pursuant to Pennsylvania law.
 
2. . All shares of the same series of Preference Stock shall be identical with each other share of such series in all respects, except that shares of any one series issued at different times may differ as to the dates from which dividends thereon shall be cumulative. Except as determined by the Board of Directors as permitted by the provisions of paragraph 1 hereof, all series of Preference Stock shall rank equally with and be identical in all respects to each other series.
Parity of Series of Preference Stock and Shares Within Series; Priority of Preference Stock
 
Preference Stock shall rank, as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, prior to Common Stock and to any other capital stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized, other than capital stock which shall by its terms rank prior to or on a parity with Preference Stock and which shall be authorized pursuant to subparagraph 9(a) hereof.
 
3. . Before any dividends (other than dividends payable in stock ranking junior to Preference Stock) on any class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be declared and set apart for payment or paid, the holders of shares of Preference Stock of each series shall be entitled to receive cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors at the annual rate, and no more, fixed in the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series. Such dividends shall be payable in cash quarterly, each such quarterly payment to be in respect of the quarterly period ending with the day next preceding the date of such payment (except in the case of the first dividend which shall be in respect of the period beginning with the initial date of issue of such shares and ending with the day next preceding the date of such payment), to holders of Preference Stock of record on the respective dates, not exceeding forty (40) days preceding such quarterly dividend payment dates, fixed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. With respect to each series of Preference Stock, such dividends shall be cumulative from the date or dates of issue of such series, which date or dates may be set by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 1 hereof. No dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any series of Preference Stock in respect of any quarterly dividend period unless there shall likewise be or have been declared and paid or set apart for payment on all shares of Preference Stock of each other series at the time outstanding like dividends in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor as hereinbefore provided for all quarterly dividend periods coinciding with or ending before such quarterly dividend period. Accruals of dividends shall not bear interest.
Dividends
 
4. . The Corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may, at any time permitted by the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of any series of Preference Stock and at the redemption price or prices stated in said resolution, redeem the whole or any part of the shares of such series at the time outstanding. If at any time less than all of the shares of Preference Stock then outstanding are to be called for redemption, the shares to be redeemed may be selected by lot or by such other equitable method as the Board of Directors in its discretion may determine. Notice of every redemption, stating the redemption date, the redemption price, and the placement of payment thereof, shall be given by mailing a copy of such notice at least thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of record of the shares of Preference Stock to be redeemed at their addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the Corporation. The Corporation, upon mailing notice of redemption as aforesaid or upon irrevocably authorizing the bank or trust company hereinafter mentioned to mail such notice, may deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with a bank or trust company in the City of Philadelphia, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, an amount equal to the redemption price of the shares to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, which amount shall be payable to the holders of the shares to be redeemed upon surrender of certificates therefor on or after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto if so directed by the Board of Directors. Upon such deposit, or if no such deposit is made, then from and after the date fixed for redemption unless the Board of Directors shall default in making payment of the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends upon surrender of certificates as aforesaid, the shares called for redemption shall cease to be
Redemption
 
outstanding and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such shares other than the right to receive the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends from such bank or trust company or from the Corporation, as the case may be, without interest thereon, upon surrender of certificates as aforesaid; provided, that conversion rights, if any, of shares called for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the business day prior to the date fixed for redemption. Any funds so deposited which shall not be required for such redemption because of the exercise of conversion rights subsequent to the date of such deposit shall be returned to the Corporation. In case any holder of shares of Preference Stock which have been called for redemption shall not, within six (6) years after the date of such deposit, have claimed the amount deposited with respect to the redemption thereof, such bank or trust company, upon demand, shall pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amount and shall thereupon be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to such holder, and thereafter such holder shall look only to the Corporation for payment thereof. Any interest which may accrue on funds so deposited shall be paid to the Corporation from time to time.
 
5. . Unless otherwise specifically provided in the resolutions of the Board of Directors authorizing the issue of any series of Preference Stock, shares of any series of Preference Stock which have been redeemed, purchased or acquired by the Corporation by means other than conversion (whether through the operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preference Stock and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preference Stock to be created by resolution of the Board of Directors or as part of any other series of Preference Stock. Shares of any series of Preference Stock converted shall not be reissued and the Board of Directors shall take appropriate actions to reflect the conversion of Preference Stock from time to time by effecting reductions in the number of shares of Preference Stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue.
Status of Shares of Preference Stock Redeemed or Acquired
 
6. . If at any time the Corporation shall have failed to pay dividends in full on Preference Stock, thereafter and until dividends in full including all accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of all series of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, shall have been declared and set apart for payment or paid, (i) the Corporation, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting separately as a class without regard to series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a meeting, shall not redeem less than all the shares of Preference Stock at such time outstanding, regardless of series, other than in accordance with paragraph 8 hereof and (ii) neither the Corporation nor any subsidiary shall purchase any shares of Preference Stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication, as determined by the Board of Directors, in their sole discretion after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series, shall determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive) will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series; provided, however, that (iii) unless prohibited by the provisions applicable to any series, the Corporation, to meet the requirements of any sinking fund provision with respect to any series, may use shares of such series acquired by it prior to such failure and then held by it as treasury stock, and (iv) nothing shall prevent the Corporation from completing the purchase or redemption of shares of Preference Stock for which a purchase contract was entered into for any sinking fund purposes or the notice of redemption of which was mailed to the holders thereof, prior to such default.
Redemption or Acquisition of Preference Stock During Default in Payment of Dividends
 
7. . So long as any shares of Preference Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare or set apart for payment or pay any dividends (other than stock dividends payable on shares of stock ranking junior to Preference Stock) or make any distribution on any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or permit any subsidiary to purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of any such junior class if at the time of making such declaration, payment, distribution, redemption, purchase or acquisition the Corporation
Dividends and Distributions on and Redemption and Acquisition of Junior Classes of Stock
 
shall be in default with respect to any dividend payable on, or any obligation to purchase, shares of any series of Preference Stock; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such junior class in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from the sale of, other shares of stock of any junior class.
 
8. . If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any obligations to retire shares of Preference Stock are not paid in full in the case of all series with respect to which such obligations exist, the number of shares of the various series to be retired shall be in proportion to the respective amounts which would be payable on account of such obligations if all amounts payable were discharged in full.
Retirement of Shares
 
9. . The Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the number of shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting (as the case may be) separately as a class without regard to series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a meeting:
Action by Corporation Requiring Approval of Preference Stock
 
(a) create any class of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or increase the authorized number of shares of any such previously authorized class of stock;
 
(b) alter or change any of the provisions hereof so as adversely to affect the preferences, special rights or powers given to the Preference Stock;
 
(c) increase the number of shares of Preference Stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue; or
 
(d) alter or change any of the provisions hereof or of the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issue of such series so as adversely to affect the preferences, special rights or powers given to such series.
 
10. . If the Corporation shall have failed to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on Preference Stock in an aggregate amount equivalent to six (6) full quarterly dividends on all shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two (2) at the first annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation held thereafter, and at such meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until dividends payable for all past quarterly dividend periods on all outstanding shares of Preference Stock shall have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, in full, the holders of the shares of Preference Stock shall have, in addition to any other voting rights which they otherwise may have, the exclusive and special right, voting separately as a class without regard to series, each share of Preference Stock entitling the holder thereof to one (1) vote per share, to elect two (2) additional members of the Board of Directors to hold office for a term of one (1) year; provided, that the right to vote as a class upon the election of such two (2) additional Directors shall not limit the right of holders of any series of Preference Stock to vote upon the election of all other Directors and upon other matters if and to the extent that such holders are entitled to vote pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof, providing for the issue of such series. Upon such payment, or declaration and setting apart for payment, in full, the terms of the two (2) additional Directors so elected shall forthwith terminate, and the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be reduced by two (2) and such voting right of the holders of shares of Preference Stock shall cease, subject to increase in the number of Directors as aforesaid and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends in an aggregate amount equivalent to six (6) full quarterly dividends as aforesaid.
Special Voting Rights
 
11. . Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, Preference Stock shall be preferred as to assets over Common Stock and any
Liquidation of the Corporation
 
other class or classes of stock ranking junior to Preference Stock so that the holders of shares of Preference Stock of each series shall be entitled to be paid or to have set apart for payment, before any distribution is made to the holders of Common Stock and any other class or classes of stock ranking junior to Preference Stock, the amount fixed in accordance with paragraph 1 hereof plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid up to and including the date fixed for such payment and the holders of Preference Stock shall not be entitled to any other payment.
 
If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, its net assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the respective amounts to which the holders of all outstanding shares of Preference Stock are entitled as above provided, the entire remaining net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed among the holders of Preference Stock in amounts proportionate to the full preferential amounts to which they are respectively entitled.
 
For the purposes of this paragraph 11, the voluntary sale, lease, exchange or transfer for cash, shares of stock (securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the Corporation's property or assets to, or its consolidation or merger with, one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
 
12. . Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of this Article Fourth or by statute or when fixed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 hereof, the holders of shares of Preference Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights.

3. .
Dividends
 
(a) The holders of outstanding shares of the Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, cash dividends accruing at the per share rate of $3.60 per annum (the "Dividend Rate") and no more, payable in cash quarterly, each such quarterly payment to be in respect of the quarterly period ending with the day next preceding the date of such payment (except in the case of the first dividend which shall be in respect of the period beginning with June 12, 1995 and ending with the day next preceding the date of such payment), to holders of Series A Preference Stock of record on the respective dates, not exceeding forty (40) days preceding such quarterly dividend payment dates, fixed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. Such dividends shall be cumulative from June 12, 1995 and shall accrue daily. Accruals of dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends will be payable on or before each March 13, June 13, September 13 and December 13 (or, if any such day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day).
 
(b) Before any dividends (other than dividends payable in Junior Stock) on any class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to Series A Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be declared and set apart for payments or paid, the holders of shares of Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to receive cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors at the Dividend Rate, and no more. No dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on the Series A Preference Stock in respect of any quarterly dividend period unless there shall likewise be or have been declared and paid or set apart for payment on all shares of Preference Stock of each other series at the time outstanding like dividends in proportion to the respective annual dividend rates fixed therefor for all quarterly dividend periods coinciding with or ending before such quarterly dividend period.
 
(c) So long as any shares of Series A Preference Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare or set apart for payment or pay any dividends (other than stock dividends payable on shares of Junior Stock) or make any distribution on any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation ranking junior to Series A Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation and shall not redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, or permit any subsidiary to purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of any such Junior Stock if at the time of making such declaration, payment, distribution, redemption, purchase or acquisition the Corporation shall be in default with respect to any dividend payable on, or any obligation to purchase, shares of Series A Preference Stock; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of stock of any such Junior Stock in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds from the sale of, other shares of stock of any Junior Stock.
 
4.
Redemptions.
 
(a) Right to Call for Redemption. At any time and from time to time, the Corporation shall have the right to call, in whole or in part, the outstanding shares of the Series A Preference Stock for redemption, subject to the notice provisions set forth in paragraph (4)(h). On the redemption date (the "Redemption Date") with respect to any such redemption, the Corporation shall deliver to the holders thereof, in exchange for each such share called for redemption, the following consideration:
 
(1) in the event such Redemption Date is prior to June 12, 1998 (the "Specified Date"),
 
(i) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Call Price (as defined in paragraph (4)(g)(ii)) in effect on the Redemption Date divided by the Current Market Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Date immediately preceding the Notice Date, plus
 
(ii) an amount in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preference Stock to and including the Redemption Date, whether or not declared, out of funds legally available therefor (and dividends shall cease to accrue on such share as of such Redemption Date); and
 
(2) in the event such Redemption Date is on or after the Specified Date,
 
(i) shares of Common Stock at the Common Equivalent Rate (determined as provided in this paragraph (4)) in effect on the Redemption Date; plus
 
(ii) an amount in cash equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preference Stock to and including the Redemption Date, whether or not
 
declared, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends (and dividends shall cease to accrue on such share as of such Redemption Date).
 
If at any time less than all of the shares of Series A Preference Stock then outstanding are to be called for redemption, the shares to be redeemed may be selected by lot or such other equitable method as the Board of Directors of the Corporation in its discretion may determine.
 
(b) Redemption or Acquisition of Series A Preference Stock During Default in Payment of Dividends. If at any time the Corporation shall have failed to pay dividends in full on Preference Stock, thereafter and until dividends in full including all accrued and unpaid dividends on shares of all series of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, shall have been declared and set apart for payment or paid, (i) the Corporation, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting separately as a class without regard to series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a meeting, shall not redeem less than all the shares of Preference Stock at such time outstanding, regardless of series, other than in accordance with paragraph 4(f) hereof and (ii) neither the Corporation nor any subsidiary shall purchase any shares of Preference Stock except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication, as determined by the Board of Directors, in their sole discretion after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series, shall determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive) will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series; provided, however, that (iii) unless prohibited by the provisions applicable to any series, the Corporation, to meet the requirements of any sinking fund provision with respect to any series, may use shares of such series acquired by it prior to such failure and then held by it as treasury stock, and (iv) nothing shall prevent the Corporation from completing the purchase or redemption of shares of Preference Stock for which a purchase contract was entered into for any sinking fund purposes or the notice of redemption of which was mailed to the holders thereof, prior to such default.
 
(c) Common Equivalent Rate; Adjustments. The Common Equivalent Rate to be used to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered on the redemption of the Series A Preference Stock in exchange for shares of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (4)(a)(2) (a "Specified Redemption") shall be initially two shares of Common Stock for each share of Series A Preference Stock; provided, however, that such Common Equivalent Rate shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below in this paragraph (4)(c). All adjustments to the Common Equivalent Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share of Common Stock. Such rate as adjusted and in effect at any time is herein called the "Common Equivalent Rate."
 
(i) If the Corporation shall do any of the following (an "Adjustment Event"):
 
(A) pay a dividend or make a distribution with respect to Common Stock in shares of Common Stock,
 
(B) subdivide, reclassify or split its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares,
 
(C) combine or reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or
 
(D) issue by reclassification of its shares of Common Stock any shares of Common Stock other than in a Fundamental Transaction (as defined in paragraph 4(g)(iv)),
 
then the Common Equivalent Rate in effect immediately prior to such Adjustment Event shall be adjusted so that the holder of a share of the Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to receive on the redemption of such share of the Series A Preference Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock that such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive after the happening of the Adjustment Event had such share of the Series A Preference Stock been redeemed pursuant to paragraph 4(a) immediately prior to the record date for such Adjustment Event, if any, or such Adjustment Event. Where the Adjustment Event is a dividend or distribution, the adjustment to the Common Equivalent Rate shall become effective as of the close of business on the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution; where the Adjustment Event is a subdivision, split, combination or reclassification, the adjustment to the Common Equivalent Rate shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision, split, combination or reclassification; and any shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of a dividend shall be deemed to have been issued immediately prior to the close of business on the record date for such dividend for purposes of calculating the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock under clauses (ii) and (iii) below. Such adjustment shall be made successively.
 
(ii) If the Corporation shall, after the date hereof, issue rights or warrants to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them (for a period not exceeding 45 days from the date of such issuance) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to paragraph (4)(c)(v)), on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, then in each case the Common Equivalent Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Common Equivalent Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights or warrants by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, immediately prior to such issuance, plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to such rights or warrants, and (B) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants, immediately prior to such issuance, plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to such rights or warrants would purchase at such Current Market Price (determined by multiplying such total number of shares by the exercise price of such rights or warrants and dividing the product so obtained by such Current Market Price). Such adjustment shall become effective as of the close of business on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Common Equivalent Rate shall be readjusted to the Common Equivalent Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. Such adjustment shall be made successively.
 
(iii) If the Corporation shall pay a dividend or make a distribution to all holders of its Common Stock of evidences of its indebtedness or other assets (including shares of capital stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock) but excluding any distributions and dividends referred to in clause (i) above or any cash dividends), or shall issue to all holders of its Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its securities (other than those referred to in clause (ii) above), then in each such case, the Common Equivalent Rate shall be adjusted by multiplying the Common Equivalent Rate in effect on the record date mentioned below by a fraction (A) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to paragraph (4)(c)(v)) on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and (B) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, whose determination shall be conclusive) as of such record date of the portion of the assets or evidences of
 
indebtedness so distributed, or of such subscription rights or warrants, applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective on the opening of business on the business day next following the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution.
 
(iv) Anything in this paragraph (4) notwithstanding, the Corporation shall be entitled to make such upward adjustment in the Common Equivalent Rate, in addition to those required by this paragraph (4), as the Corporation in its sole discretion may determine to be advisable, in order that any stock dividends, subdivision of shares, distribution of rights to purchase stock or securities, or a distribution of securities convertible into or exchangeable for stock (or any transaction that could be treated as any of the foregoing transactions pursuant to Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) hereafter made by the Corporation to its stockholders shall not be taxable. If the Corporation determines that an adjustment to the Common Equivalent Rate should be made pursuant to this paragraph (4)(c)(iv), such adjustment shall be made effective as of such date as the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines. The determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as to whether an adjustment to the Common Equivalent Rate should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (4)(c)(iv), and, if so, as to what adjustment should be made and when, shall be conclusive, final and binding on the Corporation and all stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(v) As used in this paragraph (4), the "Current Market Price" of a share of Common Stock on any date shall be, except as otherwise specifically provided, the average of the daily Closing Prices (as defined in paragraph (4)(g)(iii)) for the five consecutive Trading Dates ending on and including the date of determination of the Current Market Price; provided that if the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Date next following such five-day period (the "next-day closing price") is less than 95% of such average Closing Price, then the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such date of determination will be the next-day closing price; provided, further, that, with respect to any redemption or antidilution adjustment, if any event that results in an adjustment of the Common Equivalent Rate occurs during the period beginning on the first day of the applicable determination period and ending on the applicable redemption date, the Current Market Price as determined pursuant to the foregoing will be appropriately adjusted to reflect the occurrence of such event.
 
(vi) In any case in which paragraph (4)(c) shall require that an adjustment as a result of any event become effective as of the close of business on the record date and the date fixed for Specified Redemption pursuant to paragraph (4)(a)(2) occurs after such record date, but before the occurrence of such event, the Corporation may in its sole discretion elect to defer the following until after the occurrence of such event: (A) issuing to the holder of any redeemed shares of the Series A Preference Stock the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such redemption as a result of such adjustment and (B) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (4)(e).
 
(vii) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment to the Common Equivalent Rate that would cause the Corporation to issue shares of Common Stock for consideration below the then par value (if any) of the Common Stock upon redemption of the Series A Preference Stock, the Corporation will take any corporate action that may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Common Equivalent Rate.
 
(d) Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the Common Equivalent Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall:
 
(i) forthwith compute the adjusted Common Equivalent Rate in accordance with this paragraph (4) and prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, any Vice President, or the Treasurer of the Corporation setting forth the adjusted Common Equivalent Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based, which certificate shall be conclusive, final and binding evidence of the correctness of the adjustment, and file such certificate forthwith with the transfer agent or agents for the Series A Preference Stock and the Common Stock; and
 
(ii) mail a notice stating that the Common Equivalent Rate has been adjusted, the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based and setting forth the adjusted Common Equivalent Rate to the holders of record of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preference Stock at or prior to the time the Corporation mails an interim statement to its stockholders covering the fiscal quarter during which the facts requiring such adjustment occurred, but in any event within 45 days of the end of such fiscal quarter.
 
(e) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the redemption of any shares of Series A Preference Stock. Instead of any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon the redemption of a share of Series A Preference Stock, the Corporation shall pay to the holder of such share an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of the Current Market Price of the Common Stock determined as of the second Trading Date immediately preceding the relevant Notice Date. If more than one share shall be surrendered for redemption at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon redemption thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preference Stock so surrendered.
 
(f) Retirement. Shares of Series A Preference Stock which have been redeemed, purchased or acquired by the Corporation (whether through the operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of Preference Stock and may be reissued as a part of the series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and reissued as part of a new series of Preference Stock to be created by resolution of the Board of Directors or as part of any other series of Preference Stock. If in any case the amounts payable with respect to any obligations to retire shares of Series A Preference Stock and any other series of Preference Stock are not paid in full in the case of all series with respect to which such obligations exist, the number of shares of the various series to be retired shall be in proportion to the respective amounts which would be payable on account of such obligations if all amounts payable were discharged in full.

Notice of every redemption, stating the redemption date, the redemption price, and the placement of payment thereof, shall be given by mailing a copy of such notice at least thirty (30) days and not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to the holders of record of the shares of Series A Preference Stock to be redeemed at their addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the Corporation. The Corporation, upon mailing notice of redemption as aforesaid or upon irrevocably authorizing the bank or trust company hereinafter mentioned to mail such notice, may deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with a bank or trust company in the City of Philadelphia, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, an amount equal to the redemption price of the shares to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, which amount shall be
 
payable to the holders of the shares to be redeemed upon surrender of certificates therefor on or after the date fixed for redemption or prior thereto if so directed by the Board of Directors. Upon such deposit, or if no such deposit is made, then from and after the date fixed for redemption unless the Board of Directors shall default in making payment of the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends upon surrender of certificates as aforesaid, the shares called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares and shall have no interest in or claim against the Corporation with respect to such shares other than the right to receive the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends from such bank or trust company or from the Corporation, as the case may be, without interest thereon, upon surrender of certificates as aforesaid. In case any holder of shares of Series A Preference Stock which have been called for redemption shall not, within six (6) years after the date of such deposit, have claimed the amount deposited with respect to the redemption thereof, such bank or trust company, upon demand, shall pay over to the Corporation such unclaimed amount and shall thereupon be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof to such holder, and thereafter such holder shall look only to the Corporation for payment thereof. Any interest which may accrue on funds so deposited shall be paid to the Corporation from time to time.
 
(i) Surrender of Certificates; Status. Each holder of shares of Series A Preference Stock to be redeemed shall surrender the certificates evidencing such shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall so require and the notice shall so state) to the Corporation at the place designated in the notice of such redemption and shall thereupon be entitled to receive certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock and to receive any other funds payable pursuant to this paragraph (4) following such surrender and following the date of such redemption. In case fewer than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are called for redemption, a new certificate shall be issued at the expense of the Corporation representing the unredeemed shares. If such notice of redemption shall have been given, and if on the date fixed for redemption shares of Common Stock and other funds necessary for the redemption shall have been either set aside by the Corporation separate and apart from its other funds or assets in trust for the account of the holders of the shares to be redeemed (and so as to be and continue to be available therefor) or deposited with a bank or trust company as provided in paragraph (4)(h), then, notwithstanding that the certificates evidencing any shares of Series A Preference Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered, the shares represented thereby so called for redemption shall be deemed no longer outstanding, dividends with respect to the shares so called for redemption shall cease to accrue after the date fixed for redemption, and all rights with respect to the shares so called for redemption shall forthwith after such date cease and terminate, except for the right of the holders to receive the shares of Common Stock and other funds, if any, payable pursuant to this paragraph (4) without interest upon surrender of their certificates therefor.
 
(j) Dividend Payments. The holders of shares of Series A Preference Stock at the close of business on a dividend payment record date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date notwithstanding the call for redemption thereof (except that holders of shares called for redemption on a date occurring between such record date and the dividend payment date or on such dividend payment date shall not be entitled to receive such dividend on such dividend payment date but instead will receive accrued and unpaid dividends to such redemption date.)
 
(k) Payment of Taxes. The Corporation will pay any and all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on the redemption of shares of Series A Preference Stock pursuant to this paragraph (4); provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any registration of transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered holder of Series A Preference Stock redeemed or to be redeemed, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid.
 
5. .
Liquidation Preference
 
(a) Upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Series A Preference Stock shall be preferred as to assets over Common Stock and any other Junior Stock so that the holder of each share of the Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to be paid or to have set apart for payment in respect of each such share, before any distribution is made to the holders of Common Stock and any other Junior Stock, a liquidation preference equal to twice the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation based on advice of tax counsel in accordance with United States federal income tax principles, which determination shall be conclusive) of a Series A Depositary Share (as defined in the Deposit Agreement dated as of June 13, 1995 between the Corporation and First Chicago Trust Company of New York, as Depositary) on the date of issuance thereof, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid up to and including the date fixed for such payment, and such holder of a share of the Series A Preference Stock shall not be entitled to any other payment. If upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, its net assets shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full of the respective amounts to which the holders of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preference Stock and any outstanding Preference Stock that is Parity Stock are entitled, the entire remaining net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed among the holders of the Series A Preference Stock and any outstanding Preference Stock that is Parity Stock, in amounts proportionate to the full preferential amounts to which they are respectively entitled.
 
(b) The voluntary sale, lease, exchange or transfer for cash, shares of stock (securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the Corporation's property or assets to, or its consolidation or merger with, one or more corporations shall not be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

Voting Rights
 
(a) The holders of record of shares of Series A Preference Stock shall not be entitled to any voting rights except as hereinafter provided in this paragraph (6) or as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or by statute.

Each share of the Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to one vote.
 
(c) (i) If the Corporation shall have failed to pay, or declare and set apart for payment, dividends on Preference Stock in an aggregate amount equivalent to six (6) full quarterly dividends on all shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by two (2) at the first annual meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation held thereafter, and at such meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting until dividends payable for all past quarterly dividend periods on all outstanding shares of Preference Stock shall have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment, in full, the holders of the shares of Preference Stock shall have, in addition to any other voting rights which they otherwise may have, the exclusive and special right, voting separately as a class without regard to series, each share of Preference Stock entitling the holder thereof to one (1) vote per share, to elect two (2) additional members of the Board of Directors to hold office for a term of one (1) year; provided, that the right to vote as a class upon the election of such two (2) additional Directors shall not limit the right of holders of the Series A Preference Stock to vote upon the election of all other Directors and upon other matters set forth in paragraph 6(b) above.
 
(ii) Upon such payment, or declaration and setting apart for payment, in full, the terms of the two (2) additional Directors so elected shall forthwith terminate, and the number of Directors of the Corporation shall be reduced by two (2) and such voting right of the holders of shares of Preference Stock shall cease, subject to increase in the number of Directors as aforesaid and to revesting of such voting right in the event of each and every additional failure in the payment of dividends in an aggregate amount equivalent to six (6) full quarterly dividends as aforesaid.
 
(d) The Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the number of shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, voting or consenting (as the case may be) separately as a class without regard to series, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by resolution adopted at a meeting:
 
(i) create any class of stock ranking prior to or on a parity with Preference Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or increase the authorized number of shares of any such previously authorized class of stock;
 
(ii) alter or change any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation so as to adversely affect the preferences, special rights or powers given to the Preference Stock;
 
(iii) increase the number of shares of Preference Stock which the Corporation is authorized to issue; or
 
(iv) alter or change any of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or hereof so as to adversely affect the preferences, special rights or powers given to the Series A Preference Stock.
 
7. . The Series A Preference Stock shall not have any conversion rights to convert into Common Stock.
Conversion
 
8. . Upon the effectiveness of a Fundamental Transaction at any time, each share of Series A Preference Stock shall be entitled to receive consideration per share (i) of the same type as is offered to or to be received by holders of Common Stock pursuant to or in connection with such Fundamental Transaction and (ii) having a fair value equal to the fair value of the Common Stock that each share of Series A Preference Stock would receive if such share of Series A Preference Stock were redeemed by the Company immediately prior to such time in accordance with paragraph 4 hereof.
Fundamental Transactions
 
 
. . The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series B Participating Cumulative Preference Stock" (the "Series B Preference Stock"), and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 1,743,019. Such number of shares of the Series B Preference Stock may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B Preference Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding rights, options or other securities issued by the Corporation.

Section 2
Dividends and Distributions
 
(A) The holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable on or before March 13, June 13, September 13 and December 13 (or, if any such day is not a business day, on
 
the next succeeding business day) of each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preference Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 and (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends or other distributions and 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends or other distributions (other than (i) a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Corporation (the "Common Stock")) or (ii) a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preference Stock. If the Corporation shall at any time after February 1, 1996 (the "Rights Declaration Date") pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Preference Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than as described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of paragraph (A)); provided that if no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date (or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, the period between the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preference Stock and such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series B Preference Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Preference Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series B Preference Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is on or before the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and on or before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on shares of Series B Preference Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
. . Except as otherwise provided by Article FOURTH of the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or by statute, holders of Series B Preference Stock shall have no voting rights, and their consent shall not be required for taking any corporate action.

(i) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preference Stock;
 
(ii) declare or pay dividends on, or make any other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preference Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series B Preference Stock and all such other parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(iii) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preference Stock; provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of stock of the Corporation ranking junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series B Preference Stock; or
 
(iv) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of Series B Preference Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preference Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of Series B Preference Stock and all such other parity stock upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preference Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the provision clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
. . If the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series B Preference Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged for or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash or any other property, as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B Preference Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, July 7, 2005  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock split is for shareholders of record as of July 18, 2005, and shares will be distributed on or about, August 1, 2005. Holders of record of the Company's common stock on the record date will receive one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock they own.
 
As of today, there are approximately 68.3 million shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding. After the split, there will be approximately 136.6 million shares of the Company's common stock outstanding. The Company expects the adjusted number of shares outstanding and adjusted per-share stock price to be reported by the New York Stock Exchange, effective August 1, 2005.
 
In other business, Sunoco's board of directors today declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2005 on all full shares of common stock outstanding, payable September 9, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2005. In view of the fact that the stock split will have been completed prior to the record date, the cash dividend for the third quarter will be 20 cents per share.
