Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA, August 3, 2005  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) today reported net income of $242 million ($1.75 per share diluted) for the second quarter of 2005 versus $234 million ($1.53 per share diluted) for the 2004 second quarter. For the first half of 2005, Sunoco reported net income of $358 million ($2.58 per share diluted) versus net income of $323 million ($2.12 per share diluted) for the first half of 2004. All per-share amounts reflect the two-for-one stock split effected as a dividend on August 1, 2005.
 
"Results continued to be very strong," said John G. Drosdick, Sunoco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our second-quarter earnings represent a new record for the Company and on a per-share basis, year-to-date earnings are up 22 percent versus last year's then-record first half.
 
"Market conditions for our refining business remained robust and operationally we set several new quarterly production records, including total crude unit and conversion unit throughput. In a particularly strong market for distillate products, we achieved record distillate production. We also increased our use of discounted high-acid crude oils to approximately 59,000 barrels per day during the quarter and have run over 70,000 barrels per day when market conditions have warranted. Optimization efforts and reliability improvements such as these helped Refining and Supply earn $212 million for the quarter. This organization has done an excellent job meeting the challenges and the opportunities that the market has provided.
 
"Chemicals continued to improve year-on-year results, earning $30 million in the quarter versus $12 million in the second quarter of 2004. Margins, particularly for phenol and related products, were much improved versus the year-ago quarter. Over the past twelve months, Sunoco Chemicals has earned $133 million and has become a much bigger contributor to our overall results. Despite some slowdown in apparent demand growth, we believe the outlook for continued improvement in this business remains favorable."

Drosdick continued, "In other businesses, Retail Marketing earned $7 million. While much improved from the 2005 first quarter, generally rising crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices have persistently squeezed retail margins throughout the first half of the year. Sun Coke earned $13 million in the quarter as operations at our new coke plant in Haverhill, Ohio began to contribute. Logistics earned $9 million for the quarter.
 
"In other matters, we continued our share repurchase program - $61 million during the quarter and $131 million year to date  and on August 1, we completed a two-for-one stock split. We ended the quarter with $417 million of cash and a net debt-to-capital ratio, as defined in our revolving credit agreement, of 33 percent  each improved from year-end 2004. We will continue to carefully use this financial capacity to both invest in and grow our asset portfolio and appropriately return cash to our shareholders."
 
DETAILS OF SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
 
REFINING AND SUPPLY
 
Refining and Supply earned $212 million in the current quarter versus $217 million in the second quarter of 2004. Despite a decline in benchmark margins in the Northeast, realized margins have improved versus the year-ago quarter largely as a result of the increased use of discounted high-acid crude oils and the favorable impact of product optimization activities. The higher realized margins and higher production volumes were more than offset by higher expenses, including fuel and employee-related charges.
 
Total crude unit throughput averaged 890.8 thousand barrels daily (99 percent utilization) for the quarter, with total production available for sale approximating 86 million barrels.
 
RETAIL MARKETING
 
Retail Marketing earned $7 million in the second quarter of 2005 versus $20 million in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in results was due largely to lower retail margins for gasoline, partially offset by lower expenses and higher gains on asset divestments.
 
CHEMICALS
 
Chemicals earned $30 million in the second quarter of 2005 versus $12 million in the prior-year period. The increase in earnings was due largely to higher realized margins for phenol and polypropylene. Total sales volumes were down slightly from the year-ago period due primarily to scheduled maintenance performed during the quarter at the Haverhill, Ohio phenol facility. This maintenance was performed concurrent with work to tie in the plant to the steam generation system at Sun Coke's adjacent cokemaking facility which will serve to reduce the phenol facility's energy costs in the future.

LOGISTICS
 
Earnings for the Logistics segment were $9 million in both second-quarter periods.
 
COKE
 
The Coke business earned $13 million in the second quarter of 2005 versus $9 million in the second quarter of 2004. The increase was due largely to higher coal sales volumes and prices and the start-up of the Haverhill coke plant during the quarter.
 
CORPORATE AND OTHER
 
Corporate administrative expenses were $16 million after tax in the current quarter versus $13 million in the comparable quarter last year. The increase was largely due to higher employee-related expenses, including accruals for stock-based incentive compensation.
 
Net financing expenses were $13 million after tax in the second quarter of 2005 versus $20 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from 2004 debt restructuring activities and increased capitalized interest.
 
SIX MONTH RESULTS
 
Sunoco earned $358 million for the first six months of 2005 versus $323 million in the comparable 2004 period. The increase was primarily due to higher refining margins and volumes, increased chemicals margins and lower net financing expenses. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower retail gasoline margins and higher expenses.
 
Sunoco, Inc., headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of petroleum and petrochemical products. With 900,000 barrels per day of refining capacity, approximately 4,800 retail sites selling gasoline and convenience items, approximately 4,500 miles of crude oil and refined product owned and operated pipelines and 38 product terminals, Sunoco is one of the largest independent refiner-marketers in the United States. Sunoco is a significant manufacturer of petrochemicals with annual sales of approximately five billion pounds, largely chemical intermediates used to make fibers, plastics, film and resins. Utilizing a unique, patented technology, Sunoco also has the capacity to manufacture over 2.5 million tons annually of high-quality metallurgical-grade coke for use in the steel industry.
