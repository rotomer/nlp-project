On February 27, 2006, Richard H. Lenny, a current director of Sunoco, Inc. ("Sunoco") and member of the Compensation and Governance Committees of the Board of Directors, notified Sunoco of his decision to not stand for re-election as a director at Sunoco's Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for May 4, 2006. Mr. Lenny is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Hershey Company ("Hershey"). His decision not to stand for re-election is due to increased business demands as Hershey expands its product portfolio and geographic presence. The decision was not because of any disagreement with Sunoco.
