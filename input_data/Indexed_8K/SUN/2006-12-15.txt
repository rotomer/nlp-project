The amount of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total amount of the Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Offered Securities, as adjusted by the Representatives in such manner as the Representatives deem advisable to avoid fractional shares/units.
If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts, the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust authorize the Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts substantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto () with such changes therein as the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust may authorize or approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are only to be with institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust will pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts ().

Underwriters will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust execute and deliver Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract Securities will be deducted from the Offered Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the principal amount or number of shares of Offered Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Lead Underwriter determines that such reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and so advises the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust. The Company and, as the case may be, the Trust will advise the Lead Underwriter not later than the business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount or number of shares of Contract Securities.
If the Offered Securities are debt securities or Capital Securities and the Terms Agreement specifies settlement or otherwise states that the provisions of this paragraph shall apply, the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust will deliver against payment of the purchase price the Offered Securities in the form of one or more permanent global securities in definitive form (the ) deposited with the Trustee as custodian for The Depository Trust Company () or as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Interests in any permanent global securities will be held only in book-entry form through DTC, except in the limited circumstances described in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus. Payment for the Offered Securities shall be made by the Underwriters in Federal (same day) funds by official check or checks or wire transfer to an account previously designated by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust at a bank acceptable to the Lead Underwriter, in each case drawn to the order of the Company at the place of payment specified in the Terms Agreement on the Closing Date, against delivery to the Trustee as custodian for DTC of the Global Securities representing all of the Offered Securities.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
(b) Each Underwriter will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Offered Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus identified in Schedule 1 to the Terms Agreement or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 4(d) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Trust by such Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in the Terms Agreement.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject
provided, further
 
matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or behalf of an indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust who has signed the Registration Statement and to each
 
person, if any, who controls the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust within the meaning of the Act.
7. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or, as the case may be, the Trust, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. If the Offered Securities are debt securities or Preferred Securities, the respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts (if debt securities) or numbers of shares (if Preferred Securities) of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.

If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 5(c), the Company and, as the case may be, the Trust will
