The Bylaws became effective immediately upon the adoption of such resolutions by the Company's Board of Directors on September 4, 2008. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full amended and restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3(ii) to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 3(ii)
 
 
i
 
ii
Membership and Term of Office
.    The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of the number of Directors as may from time to time be determined by the Board, except that it shall not consist of less than five members. Directors need not be residents of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Section 1
Except as hereinafter provided in Section 2 of this Article I, Directors shall be elected by ballot at the annual meeting of shareholders and shall hold office for one year and until successors are duly elected and qualified, or until earlier resignation or removal. In an uncontested election, if a nominee for director who is an incumbent director does not receive the vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. In an uncontested election, if a nominee for director who is not an incumbent director does not receive the vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the nominee will be deemed to have been elected to the Board and to have immediately resigned. For purposes of this Section 1 of Article 1, a majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election (to the extent that abstentions are permitted). In a contested election, as determined by the Board of Directors, Directors shall be elected by plurality vote, even if a formerly contested election is uncontested at the time of any meeting for the election of Directors.
To be eligible to stand for election, each person who agrees to be nominated must also agree, in writing, to be bound by the provisions of this Section 1 of Article I.
The Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Governance Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal.
If a Director's resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a nominee for Director who is not an incumbent is deemed to have been elected and to have immediately resigned, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of this Article I, or may decrease the size of the Board pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1 of this Article I.
 
This Bylaw will be summarized or included in each proxy statement relating to an election of directors of the Corporation.
Vacancies; Election of Additional Directors
.    A majority of the incumbent members of the Board of Directors, though such majority be less than a quorum, shall have the exclusive authority to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors. If the number of Directors is at any time increased, the incumbent Directors may by majority vote elect any additional Director. Such newly elected Director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until a successor is elected and qualified, or until earlier resignation or removal.
Section 2
Emergency Board
.    In the event of any emergency by reason of nuclear attack or other attacks by enemy forces upon the North American Continent, there shall be constituted without further action or authority an Emergency Board of Directors. In the event of an emergency by reason of physical disasters of national or greater scope, an attack upon the United States outside the North American Continent, or an imminent threat of an attack or physical disaster of national or greater scope upon the North American Continent, there shall be constituted an Emergency Board of Directors by declaration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Emergency Board shall consist of at least three members from the regular Board of Directors or from officers of the Corporation or its subsidiaries who are not members of the regular Board of Directors but who have been designated as alternate members of the Emergency Board. The Emergency Board may exercise all of the powers of the regular Board of Directors in the management of the business, affairs and property of the Corporation during the emergency and until such time as the regular Board of Directors shall resume the exercise of its powers.
Section 3
The original members of the Emergency Board shall be the Chairman, the President and the Executive Vice Presidents who are members of the Board of Directors, provided however, that any vacancy existing because of the unavailability of any two of the foregoing persons shall be filled by the alternate members. The Chairman of the Board shall serve as Chairman of any meeting of the Emergency Board or, in the event of his unavailability for any reason, the President or an Executive Vice President, in order designated by the Chairman of the Board, shall serve in this capacity. In the event of the unavailability for any reason of all of the foregoing persons, an alternate member shall serve as Chairman at any meeting of the Emergency Board in the order previously designated for membership by resolution of the regular Board of Directors.
Meetings may be called by any member of the Emergency Board. Two members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of any two members present at a meeting shall be the act of the Emergency Board. Meetings may be held by any means of communication and Directors shall be deemed present if they are in communication with other directors by any means. Notice of meetings may be given at any time and in any manner, provided that a reasonable effort shall be made to give actual notice to each member of the Emergency Board.
To the extent not inconsistent with this Section 3 of Article I, the Bylaws in their entirety shall remain in effect during any such emergency. No officer, Director or employee acting in good faith in accordance with this Section 3 of Article I or any resolutions made pursuant hereto, shall be liable for his conduct unless it is willful misconduct.
Liability of Directors
.    A Director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable for monetary damages, as such, for any action taken or any failure to take any action, unless (1) he has breached the duties of his office or has failed to perform his duties as a Director in good faith, in a manner he reasonably believed
Section 4
 
to be in the best interest of the Corporation and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances; and (2) the breach or failure to perform constitutes self-dealing, willful misconduct or recklessness.
Nomination of Directors
.    Nominations for election to the Board of Directors may be made by shareholders entitled to vote for the election of Directors only in the manner specified in this Section. All nominations for election to the Board of Directors, whether or not the proposed nomination is to be included in the Corporation's proxy statement, shall be made in accordance with this Section 5 of Article I of the Bylaws. Shareholders may submit nominations for consideration by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors for that purpose. A nomination proposed to be made at an annual meeting shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation no earlier than the December 1 and no later than the December 31 prior to the annual meeting at which such nomination is intended to be considered; provided, however, that if the date of an annual meeting is after April 30 of any year, the proposal shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation at least ninety (90) days but not more than one-hundred and twenty (120) days in advance of such annual meeting; further, provided, that if the date of such meeting is first publicly announced or disclosed (in a public filing or otherwise) less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such meeting, such prior notice shall be given not more than ten (10) days after such date is first so announced or disclosed. In order to nominate one or more persons for election as a director at an annual meeting, a shareholder must comply with the requirement to provide notice, in writing, to the Secretary of the Corporation as provided in this Section 5 of Article I of the Bylaws, and no action of the Corporation shall be deemed to satisfy this requirement for any shareholder or nomination. Nominations may be made at any meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of election of Directors other than an annual meeting only upon written notice of the shareholder's intent to make such nominations at the meeting delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at least ninety (90) days but not more than one-hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the date of such meeting; provided, however, that if the date of such meeting is first publicly announced or disclosed (in a public filing or otherwise) less than ninety (90) days prior to the date of such meeting, such prior notice shall be given not more than ten (10) days after such date is first so announced or disclosed. Such nominations and written notice of any nominations by shareholders under this Section 5 of Article I of the Bylaws shall contain the following information:
Section 5
(a) name, residence and business address of the nominating shareholder;
(b) a representation that the shareholder is a record holder or beneficial owner of the Corporation's voting shares and a statement of the number of such shares and any other ownership interests, including derivatives, hedged positions and other economic or voting interests in the Corporation;
(c) a representation that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the individuals specified in the notice, if the nominations are to be made at a meeting of shareholders;
(d) a representation as to whether the shareholder intends to deliver a proxy statement to the other shareholders of the Corporation;
(e) information regarding each nominee such as would be required to be included in a proxy statement;
(f) a description of all arrangements or understandings between and among the shareholder and each and every nominee;
 
(g) a representation by each nominee providing that such nominee does not and will not have any undisclosed voting commitments or other arrangements with respect to such nominee's actions as a director; and
(h) the written consent of each nominee to serve as a Director, if elected.
The person presiding at the meeting shall determine whether any nomination is made according to these procedures and should be accepted. Such decision shall be deemed conclusive and binding on all shareholders of the Corporation."

Section 4
Waiver of Notice
.    Notice of any meeting may be waived by a Director in writing, either before or after the meeting.

.    Notice of an adjourned meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given if the time and place are fixed at the meeting adjourning.

At any special meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's proposal shall be deemed a "Proper Matter for Shareholder Consideration" only if the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or such other person as appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, in the sole discretion of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, determines that the proposal is a Proper Matter for Shareholder Consideration and was properly brought before the meeting. No special meeting of shareholders shall be held at the call of a shareholder unless there has been a determination by the Board of Directors that (i) the notice submitted by the shareholder complies with the requirements of this Section, and (ii) the shareholder's proposal is a Proper Matter for Shareholder Consideration; provided, however, that only a proposal submitted by the calling shareholder which is determined to be a Proper Matter for Shareholder Consideration shall be considered at such special meeting of shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to the shareholders at any special meeting of shareholders including, without limitation, a special meeting of shareholders called by a shareholder.
A shareholder calling a special meeting of shareholders shall reimburse the Corporation for all costs incurred by it in connection with such special meeting of shareholders including, without limitation, the costs of preparing and disseminating a proxy statement or information statement in connection with, and soliciting proxies to be voted at, such special meeting of shareholders. A special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation called by a shareholder in accordance with Article Tenth of the Articles of Incorporation shall be held at such date, time and place as is determined by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, which date shall be not later than ninety days after the date on which the Board of Directors shall have determined that the shareholder has duly called such meeting by giving proper written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation and has otherwise complied with applicable law and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation.
Notice
.    Unless waived, written notice of the time, place and purpose of every meeting of the shareholders shall be given by the Secretary not less than five nor more than ninety days before the
Section 3
 
date of the meeting either personally or by sending a copy of such notice by mail, e-mail or other electronic transmission, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.
Quorum
.    Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, by statute or these Bylaws, at all meetings of shareholders, the presence in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
Section 4a
Quorum at Shareholder-called Special Meeting
.    At any special meeting of shareholders called by a shareholder pursuant to Article Tenth of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, the presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast at least sixty-six and two thirds percent (66
Section 4.b
 2
/
3
%) of the votes which all shareholders are entitled to cast shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
No Waiver of Quorum
.    Section 1756(b) of the BCL (and any successor provision of similar import) shall not be applicable with respect to any special meeting of shareholders called by a shareholder pursuant to Article Tenth of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, or to any adjournment thereof. If a special meeting of shareholders called by a shareholder pursuant to Article Tenth of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation cannot be organized for lack of a quorum under Section 4.b of these Bylaws, such special meeting shall be deemed finally adjourned without the taking of any shareholder action.
Section 4.c
Voting
.    When a quorum is present at any meeting of the shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote and casting a majority of the votes at the meeting shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one which, by express provision of law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, requires a different vote, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. The shareholders present in person or by proxy at any duly organized meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.
Section 5
Adjournment
.    The holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes present or represented at any meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time, though such majority constitutes less than a quorum. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, it shall not be necessary to give notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting adjourning and at the adjourned meeting only such business is transacted as might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Section 6
Proxies
.    Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy. Every proxy shall be executed or authenticated by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, and filed with, or transmitted to, the Secretary of the Corporation or its designated agent. A shareholder, or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, may execute or authenticate a writing or transmit an electronic message authorizing another person to act for him by proxy. A telegram, telex, cablegram, datagram, e-mail, internet communication or other means of electronic transmission from a shareholder
Section 7
 
or attorney-in-fact, or a photographic, facsimile or similar reproduction of a writing executed by a shareholder or attorney-in-fact, will be treated as properly executed or authenticated for purposes of this section if it sets forth or utilizes a confidential and unique identification number or other mark furnished by the Corporation to the shareholder for the purposes of a particular meeting or transaction. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, authentication or transmission, unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. Unless it is coupled with an interest, a proxy shall be revocable, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the proxy to the contrary. Revocation of a proxy shall not be effective until notice thereof has been given to the Secretary of the Corporation or its designated agent in writing or by electronic transmission. A proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the shareholder but shall continue in force until revoked by the personal representative or guardian of the shareholder. The presence at any meeting of a shareholder who has given a proxy shall not revoke such proxy unless the shareholder shall give notice of such revocation in writing, or by electronic transmission, to the Secretary of the meeting prior to the voting of such proxy.
Shareholders List
.    The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make and certify a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at a shareholders' meeting or any adjournment thereof. Such list shall be arranged alphabetically within class and series, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The information contained in such list shall be made available to the shareholders by appropriate means at the time and place of the meeting of shareholders.
Section 8
Record Date
.    For the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to or dissent from any proposal without a meeting, or for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or allotment of any right, or for the purpose of any other action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date shall not be more than ninety days before the date of such meeting nor more than ninety days prior to any other action. In such case only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to notice of, and to vote at such meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotments of rights or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding transfer of any shares on the books of the Corporation after any record date so fixed. When the determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, unless the Board fixes a new record date under this section for the adjourned meeting.
Section 9
Certification by Nominee
.    The nominee shareholder of record of a shareholder dividend reinvestment plan or of an employee benefit plan may certify in writing to the Corporation that all or a portion of the shares of the Corporation registered in the name of such nominee are held for the account of a specified person or persons. Such certification shall be received by the Corporation no later than 15 days after the record date for each special or annual meeting of shareholders. The certification shall be in the form specified by the Corporation and shall include such information as the name, address and number of shares of the beneficial owners, taxpayer identification number, and any other information that the Corporation may deem necessary. Upon receipt by the Corporation of such certification, the person or persons specified in the certification shall be deemed, for the purposes of notice of and voting at the meeting of shareholders, to be the holders of record of the number of shares specified, in place of the nominee shareholder of record.
Section 10
 
Judge of Election
.    In advance of any meeting of shareholders the Board may appoint one or three judges of election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. If such judges are not so provided by the Board or shall fail to qualify, the person presiding at a shareholder meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder entitled to vote thereat shall, make such appointment. In case any person appointed as judge of election fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat. Each judge of election, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of judge of election at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. No person shall be elected a Director at a meeting at which he has served as a judge of election.
Section 11
Prior Notice of Shareholder Proposals
.    At any annual or special meeting of shareholders, proposals by shareholders (other than proposals of a shareholder calling a special meeting of shareholders pursuant to Article Tenth of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation) shall be considered only if (a) the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or such other person as appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, in the sole discretion of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, determines that the proposal is a proper matter for shareholder consideration and was properly brought before the meeting, and (b) prior notice thereof has been timely given as provided herein.
