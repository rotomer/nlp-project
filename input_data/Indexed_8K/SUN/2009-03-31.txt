No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or behalf of an indemnified party.
provided, further
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
7. . If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities under the Terms Agreement and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of
Default of Underwriters
 
shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities, the Lead Underwriter may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement), to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount (if debt securities) or number of shares (if Preferred Securities or Common Stock) of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Lead Underwriter and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, the Terms Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this Agreement, the term includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. If the Offered Securities are debt securities or Preferred Securities, the respective commitments of the several Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the principal amounts (if debt securities) or numbers of shares (if Preferred Securities) of the Offered Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.
"Underwriter"
8. .

If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 5(d), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.

All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to them at their address furnished to the Company in writing for the purpose of communications hereunder or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at the address set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Vice President and General Counsel.

Furthermore, the Company agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Underwriters has advised or is currently advising the Company on related or other matters). The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

13. . Any Representatives will act for the several Underwriters in connection with the financing described in the Terms Agreement, and any action under such Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) taken by the Representatives jointly or by the Lead Underwriter will be binding upon all the Underwriters.

INDENTURE dated as of March 31, 2009, between SUNOCO, INC., a Pennsylvania corporation (hereinafter called the "Company"), having its principal executive office at 1735 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, and U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association duly incorporated and existing under the laws of the United States of America, Trustee (hereinafter called the "Trustee").

The Debt Securities of any series shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, one of its Vice Presidents or its Treasurer, attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers may be manual or facsimile. Coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company.
Debt Securities and Coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons or did not hold such offices at the date of such Debt Securities and Coupons.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debt Securities, with appropriate Coupons, if any, of any series, executed by the Company, to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities and Coupons; , , that, in connection with its sale during the "restricted period" (as defined in Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(7) of the United States Treasury Regulations), no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and , , that a Bearer Security (other than a temporary Global Note in bearer form) may be delivered outside the United States in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished to the Euro-clear Operator or to Clearstream a

certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture. If all the Debt Securities of any one series are not to be issued at one time and if a Board Resolution or supplemental indenture relating to such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Debt Securities such as interest rate, Stated Maturity, date of issuance and date from which interest, if any, shall accrue. If any Debt Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Note, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 3.04, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Debt Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Note shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with the original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent Global Note. Except as permitted by Section 3.06 or 3.07, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all Coupons for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled.
The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, prior to the authentication and delivery of the Debt Securities and Coupons of such series, (i) the supplemental indenture or the Board Resolution by or pursuant to which the form and terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been approved and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel substantially to the effect that:
(1) all instruments furnished by the Company to the Trustee in connection with the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons conform to the requirements of this Indenture and constitute sufficient authority hereunder for the Trustee to authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities and Coupons;
(2) the forms and terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(3) in the event that the forms or terms of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been established in a supplemental indenture, the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, such supplemental indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law); and
(4) the execution and delivery of such Debt Securities and Coupons have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and such Debt Securities and Coupons have been duly executed by the Company and, assuming due authentication by the Trustee and delivery by the Company, are valid and binding obligations enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, entitled to the benefit of the Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law) and subject to such other exceptions as counsel shall request and as to which the Trustee shall not reasonably object.
 
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Debt Securities and Coupons if the issuance of such Debt Securities and Coupons pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Debt Securities and this Indenture in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Each Bearer Security (including any temporary or permanent or other definitive Bearer Security in global form) shall be dated as of the date of original issuance of the first Debt Security of such series to be issued, except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Bearer Securities of any series.
No Debt Security or Coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Debt Security a certificate of authentication substantially in one of the forms provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee or by an Authenticating Agent, and such certificate upon any Debt Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Debt Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Debt Security shall have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Debt Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.08 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02) stating that such Debt Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Debt Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 3.04.
Temporary Debt Securities; Exchange of Temporary Global Notes for Definitive Bearer Securities; Global Notes Representing Registered Securities.
(a) Pending the preparation of definitive Registered Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Registered Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination for Registered Securities of such series, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Registered Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Registered Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Registered Securities. Every such temporary Registered Security shall be executed by the Company and shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Registered Securities in lieu of which they are issued. In the case of any series issuable as Bearer Securities, such temporary Debt Securities may be in global form, and with one or more Coupons or without Coupons, representing such of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series as shall be specified therein.
Except in the case of temporary Debt Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if temporary Debt Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Debt Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of such
 
series, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Debt Securities of such series, of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions, upon surrender of the temporary Debt Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder, except as provided in Section 3.05 in connection with a transfer. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Debt Securities of any series (accompanied by any unmatured Coupons), the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of a like Stated Maturity and like terms and provisions; , , that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and , , that a definitive Bearer Security (including a permanent Bearer Security in global form) shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Until so exchanged, the temporary Registered Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Registered Securities of such series.

(b) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, all Bearer Securities of a series shall be initially issued in the form of a single temporary Bearer Security in global form (a "temporary Global Note"). The Company shall execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate, any temporary Global Note and any permanent Bearer Security in global form (as described below, a "permanent Global Note") upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as definitive Bearer Securities, and the temporary or permanent Global Note, as the case may be, shall, unless otherwise specified therein, be delivered by the Trustee to the London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common Depositary"), for the benefit of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, for credit to the account of the Company (in the case of sales of Bearer Securities by the Company directly to investors) or the managing underwriter (in the case of sales of Bearer Securities by the Company to underwriters) or such other accounts as the Company or the managing underwriter, respectively, may direct.
On or after the date specified in or determined pursuant to the terms of any temporary Global Note which (subject to any applicable laws and regulations) shall be at least 40 days after the issue date of a temporary Global Note (the "Exchange Date"), the Debt Securities represented by such temporary Global Note may be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (subject to the second succeeding paragraph) or Debt Securities to be represented thereafter by one or more permanent Global Notes in definitive form without interest coupons. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary Global Note shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Paying Agent, as the Company's agent for such purpose, at its principal office in London (or at such other place specified outside the United States pursuant to .Section 3.01) and following such surrender, the Trustee shall (1) endorse the temporary Global Note to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by an equal aggregate principal amount of such Debt Security, (2) endorse the applicable permanent Global Note, if any, to reflect the initial amount, or an increase in the amount of Debt Securities represented thereby, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Debt Securities (including any permanent Global Note), (4) deliver such definitive Debt Securities to the Holder thereof or, if such definitive Debt Security is a permanent Global Note, deliver such permanent Global Note to the Common Depositary to be held outside the United States for the accounts of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, for credit
 
to the respective accounts at the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, designated by or on behalf of the beneficial owners of such Debt Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct) and (5) redeliver such temporary Global Note to the Common Depositary, unless such temporary Global Note shall have been cancelled in accordance with Section 3.08 hereof; , , that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Note, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such temporary Global Note shall be accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by the Euro-clear Operator, as to the portion of such temporary Global Note held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (including any permanent Global Note), and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream, as to the portion of such temporary Global Note held for its account then to be exchanged for definitive Debt Securities (including any permanent Global Note), each substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Indenture. Each certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, shall be based on certificates of the account holders listed in the records of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, as being entitled to all or any portion of the applicable temporary Global Note. An account holder of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, desiring to effect the exchange of an interest in a temporary Global Note for an interest in definitive Debt Securities (including any permanent Global Note) shall instruct the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on its behalf and shall deliver to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and dated no earlier than 10 days prior to the Exchange Date. Until so exchanged, temporary Global Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities (including any permanent Global Note) of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder, except as to payment of interest, if any.
provided

The delivery to the Trustee by the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream of any certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto may be relied upon by the Company and the Trustee as conclusive evidence that a corresponding certificate or certificates has or have been delivered to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
On or prior to the Exchange Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Debt Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Note, executed by the Company. At any time, on or after the Exchange Date, upon 30 days' notice to the Trustee by the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, acting at the request of or on behalf of the beneficial owner, a Debt Security represented by a temporary Global Note or a permanent Global Note, as the case may be, may be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Debt Securities without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Note or such permanent Global Note, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, as the portion of such temporary Global Note or such permanent Global Note to be exchanged, which, unless the Debt Securities of the series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities, as contemplated by Section 3.01, shall be in the form of Bearer Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be specified by the beneficial owner thereof; , , that definitive Bearer Securities shall be

delivered in exchange for a portion of the temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note only in compliance with the requirements of the second preceding paragraph. On or prior to the forty-fifth day following receipt by the Trustee of such notice with respect to a Debt Security, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, the temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note, as the case may be, shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee or Authenticating Agent, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Debt Securities without charge following such surrender, upon the request of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, and the Trustee or Authenticating Agent shall (1) endorse the applicable temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note to reflect the reduction of its principal amount by the aggregate principal amount of such Debt Security, (2) cause the terms of such Debt Security and Coupons, if any, to be entered on a definitive Debt Security, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Debt Security, and (4) if a Bearer Security is to be delivered, deliver such definitive Debt Security outside the United States to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, for or on behalf of the beneficial owner thereof, in exchange for a portion of such temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note.
Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note, except that a Person receiving definitive Debt Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive Debt Securities in person at the offices of the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note shall be delivered only outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of redemption or acceleration of all or any part of a temporary Global Note prior to the Exchange Date, a permanent Global Note or definitive Bearer Securities, as the case may be, will not be issuable in respect of such temporary Global Note or such portion thereof, and payment thereon will instead be made as provided in such temporary Global Note.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, any temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of the same series and tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, interest payable on such temporary Global Note on an Interest Payment Date for Debt Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this Indenture, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Note on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A to this Indenture.
Any definitive Bearer Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for a portion of a temporary Global Note or the permanent Global Note shall not bear a coupon for any interest which shall theretofore have been duly paid by the Paying Agent to the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, or by the Company to the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.04.
 
With respect to Exhibits A and B to this Indenture, the Company may, in its discretion and if required or desirable under applicable law, substitute one or more other forms of such exhibits for such exhibits, eliminate the requirement that any or all certificates be provided, or change the time that any certificate may be required, provided that such substitute form or forms or notice of elimination or change of such certification requirement have theretofore been delivered to the Trustee with a Company Request and such form or forms, elimination or change is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
(c) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Registered Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Notes, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 3.03 and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Notes in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Notes, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the U.S. Depositary for such Global Note or Notes or the nominee of such depositary, and (iii) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "This Debt Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary, unless and until this Debt Security is exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in definitive form."
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 3.05, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Registered Securities in definitive form, a Global Note representing all or a portion of the Registered Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the U.S. Depositary for such series to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by such depositary or any such nominee to a successor U.S. Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor depositary.
If at any time the U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of such series or if at any time the U.S. Depositary for Debt Securities of a series shall no longer be a clearing agency registered and in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor U.S. Depositary with respect to the Debt Securities of such series. If a successor U.S. Depositary for the Debt Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
 
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Notes shall no longer be represented by such Global Note or Notes. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
If the Registered Securities of any series shall have been issued in the form of one or more Global Notes and if an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company will promptly execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Debt Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Note or Notes representing such series in exchange for such Global Note or Notes.
If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to Registered Securities of a series, the U.S. Depositary for such series of Registered Securities may surrender a Global Note for such series of Debt Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge:
(i) to each Person specified by the U.S. Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Note; and
(ii) to the U.S. Depositary a new Global Note in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Note and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
Upon the exchange of a Global Note for Registered Securities in definitive form, such Global Note shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Debt Securities issued in exchange for a Global Note pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the U.S. Depositary for such Global Note, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall make available such Debt Securities to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities are so registered.
Section 3.05.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
(a) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the registers maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers and exchanges of Registered
 
Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and registering transfers and exchanges of Registered Securities as herein provided; , , that the Company may appoint co-Security Registrars.
provided
however
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series of like aggregate principal amount of such denominations as are authorized for Registered Securities of such series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.04 and this Section 3.05, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of like aggregate principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Registered Securities are surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
(b) If and to the extent specified pursuant to Section 3.01, the provisions of this Section 3.05(b) shall be applicable to Debt Securities of any series which are Bearer Securities. At the option of the Holder thereof, to the extent permitted by law, any Bearer Security of any series which by its terms is registrable as to principal and interest may be exchanged for a Registered Security of such series of like aggregate principal amount and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions upon surrender of such Bearer Security at the Corporate Trust Office or at any other office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 3.01 for the purpose of making any such exchanges. Any Coupon Security surrendered for exchange shall be surrendered with all unmatured Coupons and any matured Coupons in default attached thereto. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that except as otherwise provided in Section 12.03, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be
provided
however
 
(or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Bearer Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the Person so surrendering the Bearer Security), and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. The Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Security or Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Bearer Securities for Registered Securities will be subject to the provisions of United States income tax laws and regulations applicable to Debt Securities in effect at the time of such exchange.
(c) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, in no event may Registered Securities, including Registered Securities received in exchange for Bearer Securities, be exchanged for Bearer Securities.
(d) All Debt Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Debt Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Debt Securities surrendered for such transfer or exchange.
Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of Debt Securities except as provided in Section 3.04(b) or 3.06. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration, transfer or exchange of Debt Securities, other than those exchanges expressly provided in this Indenture to be made at the Company's own expense or without expense or without charge to the Holders and not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to register, transfer or exchange Debt Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the transmission of a notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 13.03 and ending at the close of business on the day of such transmission, or (ii) to register, transfer or exchange any Debt Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Debt Security being redeemed in part.
Section 3.06.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Debt Securities.
If (i) any mutilated Debt Security or any mutilated Coupon with the Coupon Security to which it appertains (and all unmatured Coupons attached thereto) is surrendered to the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office (in the case of Registered Securities) or at the principal London office (in the case of Bearer Securities) of the Paying Agent, or (ii) the Company and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debt Security or any Coupon, and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as
 
may be required by them to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless, and neither the Company nor the Trustee receives notice that such Debt Security or Coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, then the Company shall execute and upon Company Request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or in exchange for the Coupon Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, a new Debt Security of the same series of like Stated Maturity and with like terms and conditions and like principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously Outstanding, and, in the case of a Coupon Security, with such Coupons attached thereto that neither gain nor loss in interest shall result from such exchange or substitution.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or Coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Debt Security, pay the amount due on such Debt Security or Coupon in accordance with its terms; , , that principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 12.03, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 or except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.06, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the Coupons appertaining thereto.
provided
however
Upon the issuance of any new Debt Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in respect thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Debt Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities or Coupons of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities or Coupons.
Section 3.07.
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
(a) Interest on any Registered Security which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Registered Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest notwithstanding the cancellation of such Registered Security upon any transfer or exchange subsequent to the Regular Record Date. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, payment of interest on Registered Securities shall be made at the place or places specified pursuant to Section 3.01 or, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or, if provided pursuant to Section 3.01, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Registered Holder.
 
(b) Interest on any Coupon Security which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Holder of the Coupon which has matured on such Interest Payment Date upon surrender of such Coupon on such Interest Payment Date at the principal London office of the Paying Agent or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 3.01.
Interest on any Bearer Security (other than a Coupon Security) which is payable and is punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Holder of the Bearer Security upon presentation of such Bearer Security and notation thereon on such Interest Payment Date at the principal London office of the Paying Agent or at such other Place of Payment outside the United States specified pursuant to Section 3.01.
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, at the direction of the Holder of any Bearer Security or Coupon payable in Dollars, payment on such Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by check drawn on a bank in The City of New York or, if agreeable to the Trustee, by wire transfer to a Dollar account maintained by such Holder outside the United States. If such payment at the offices of all Paying Agents outside the United States becomes illegal or is effectively precluded because of the imposition of exchange controls or similar restrictions on the full payment or receipt of such amounts in Dollars, the Company will appoint an office or agent in the United States at which such payment may be made. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, at the direction of the Holder of any Bearer Security or Coupon payable in a Foreign Currency, payment on such Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by a check drawn on a bank outside the United States or by wire transfer to an appropriate account maintained by such Holder outside the United States. Except as provided in this paragraph, no payment on any Bearer Security or Coupon will be made by mail to an address in the United States or by wire transfer to an account in the United States.
(c) Any interest on any Debt Security which is payable but is not punctually paid or duly provided for on any interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall, if such Debt Security is a Registered Security, forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of his having been such Registered Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Registered Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money in the Currency or Currency unit in which the Debt Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Sections 3.01 or 3.10) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements
 
satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which date shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Holders of such Registered Securities at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Registered Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Registered Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Registered Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
(d) Any Defaulted Interest payable in respect of Bearer Securities of any series shall be payable pursuant to such procedures as may be satisfactory to the Trustee in such manner that there is no discrimination between the Holders of Registered Securities (if any) and Bearer Securities of such series, and notice of the payment date therefor shall be given by the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Company, in the manner provided in Section 1.05 not more than 25 days and not less than 20 days prior to the date of the proposed payment.
(e) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debt Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Debt Security.
In the case of any Registered Security of any series that is convertible, which Registered Security is converted after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (other than any Registered Security whose Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest whose Stated Maturity is on such Interest Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion, and such interest (whether or not punctually paid or duly provided for) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Registered Security (or one or more predecessor Registered Securities) is registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Registered Security which is converted, interest whose due date or Interest Payment Date is after the date of conversion of such Registered Security shall not be payable.
 
Section 3.08.
Cancellation.
Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, all Debt Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer, exchange or credit against any sinking fund and all Coupons surrendered for payment or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee. All Debt Securities and matured Coupons so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Debt Securities or Coupons previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Debt Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued, and all Debt Securities or Coupons so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Debt Securities or Coupons shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Debt Securities or Coupons cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Debt Securities and Coupons held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by the Trustee unless the Company shall request otherwise. The acquisition of any Debt Securities or Coupons by the Company shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented thereby unless and until such Debt Securities or Coupons are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. In the case of any temporary Global Note which shall be destroyed if the entire aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities represented thereby has been exchanged, the certificate of destruction shall state that all certificates required pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof and substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, to be given by the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, have been duly presented to the Trustee by the Euro-clear Operator or Clearstream, as the case may be. Permanent Global Notes shall not be destroyed until exchanged in full for definitive Debt Securities or until payment thereon is made in full.
Section 3.09.
Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, interest on the Debt Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 3.10.
Currency of Payments in Respect of Debt Securities.
(a) Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Bearer Securities of any series, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on Bearer Securities of such series denominated in any Currency will be made in such Currency.
(b) With respect to Registered Securities of any series not permitting the election provided for in paragraph (c) below or the Holders of which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (c) below, except as provided in paragraph (e) below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on any Registered Security of such series will be made in the Currency in which such Registered Security is payable.
(c) It may be provided pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Registered Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f)
 
below, to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on such Registered Securities in any of the Currencies which may be designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee a written election, to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such Currency, such election will remain in effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee (but any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such change or election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any Registered Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has occurred or notice of redemption has been given by the Company pursuant to Article Thirteen). Any Holder of any such Registered Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee by the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment date in the relevant Currency as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 3.10.
(d) If the election referred to in paragraph (c) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.01, then not later than the fourth Business Day after the Election Date for each payment date, the Trustee will deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the Currency in which each series of the Registered Securities is payable, the respective aggregate amounts of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on the Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, specifying the amounts so payable in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the Holders of Registered Securities denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (c) above has been provided for pursuant to Section 3.01 and if at least one Holder has made such election, then, on the second Business Day preceding each payment date, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate in respect of the Currency payments to be made on such payment date. The Currency amount receivable by Holders of Registered Securities who have elected payment in a Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above shall be determined by the Company on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the third Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment date.
(e) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency, the ECU or any other Currency unit in which any of the Debt Securities are denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant to paragraph (c) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on the applicable Debt Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency, the ECU or such other Currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign Currency, the ECU or such other Currency unit was used (the "Conversion Date"), the Dollar shall be the Currency of payment for use on each such payment date. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the Trustee and by the Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Debt Securities with respect to such payment date shall be the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of a Currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as determined by the Currency Determination Agent in the manner provided in paragraph (g) or (h) below.
 
(f) If the Holder of a Registered Security denominated in any Currency shall have elected to be paid in another Currency as provided in paragraph (c) above, and a Conversion Event occurs with respect to such elected Currency, such Holder shall receive payment in the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election. If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to the Currency in which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 3.10.
(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent payment date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate on the Conversion Date.
(h) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (i) below, shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.
(i) For purposes of this Section 3.10 the following terms shall have the following meanings:
A "Component Currency" shall mean any Currency which, on the Conversion Date, was a component Currency of the relevant Currency unit, including, but not limited to, the ECU.
A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were represented in the relevant Currency unit, including, but not limited to, the ECU, on the Conversion Date. If after the Conversion Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated into a single Currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single Currency equal to the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component Currencies expressed in such single Currency, and such amount shall thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single Currency shall thereafter be a Component Currency. If after the Conversion Date any Component Currency shall be divided into two or more Currencies, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of such two or more Currencies with appropriate Dollar equivalents at the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement equal to the Dollar equivalent of the Specified Amount of such former Component Currency at the Market Exchange Rate on such date, and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such Currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If after the Conversion Date of the relevant Currency unit, including but not limited to, the ECU, a Conversion Event (other than any event referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any Component Currency of such Currency unit, the
 
Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on the Conversion Date of such Component Currency.
"Election Date" shall mean the record date with respect to any payment date, and with respect to the Maturity shall mean the record date (if within 16 or fewer days prior to the Maturity) immediately preceding the Maturity, and with respect to any series of Debt Securities whose record date immediately preceding the Maturity is more than 16 days prior to the Maturity or any series of Debt Securities for which no record dates are provided with respect to interest payments, shall mean the date which is 16 days prior to the Maturity.
(j) All decisions and determinations of the Currency Determination Agent regarding the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit and the Market Exchange Rate shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company and all Holders of the Debt Securities denominated or payable in the relevant Currency. In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give notice in the manner provided in Section 1.05 to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date. In the event of a Conversion Event with respect to the ECU or any other Currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Company, after learning thereof, will immediately give notice thereof to the Trustee (and the Trustee will promptly thereafter give written notice in the manner provided in Section 1.05 to the Holders) specifying the Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each Component Currency on the Conversion Date. In the event of any subsequent change in any Component Currency as set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above, the Company, after learning thereof, will similarly give written notice to the Trustee. The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying and acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Currency Determination Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine such information independently.
(k) For purposes of any provision of the Indenture where the Holders of Outstanding Debt Securities may perform an Act which requires that a specified percentage of the Outstanding Debt Securities of all series perform such Act and for purposes of any decision or determination by the Trustee of amounts due and unpaid for the principal (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities of all series in respect of which moneys are to be disbursed ratably, the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Outstanding Debt Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency will be the amount in Dollars based upon the Market Exchange Rate for Debt Securities of such series, as of the date for determining whether the Holders entitled to perform such Act have performed it, or as of the date of such decision or determination by the Trustee, as the case may be.
Section 3.11.
Judgments.
If for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Debt Security, it shall become necessary to convert into any other Currency any amount in the Currency due hereunder or under such Debt Security, then
 
such conversion shall be made at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date the Company shall make payment to any Person in satisfaction of such judgment. If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date other than the date payment is made and there shall occur a change between such Market Exchange Rate and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of payment, the Company agrees to pay such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount in such other Currency which, when converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of payment or distribution, is the amount then due hereunder or under such Debt Security. Any amount due from the Company under this Section 3.11 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or in respect of any Debt Security. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the Currency or Currency unit due hereunder or under such Debt Security at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect when payment is made than the amount of Currency stated to be due hereunder or under such Debt Security so that in any event the Company's obligations hereunder or under such Debt Security will be effectively maintained as obligations in such Currency, and the Company shall be entitled to withhold (or be reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion over the amount due and payable on the date of payment or distribution.
Section 3.12.
Exchange Upon Default.
If default is made in the payments referred to in Section 12.01, the Company hereby undertakes that upon presentation and surrender of a permanent Global Note to the Trustee (or to any other Person or at any other address as the Company may designate in writing), on any Business Day on or after the maturity date thereof the Company will issue and the Trustee will authenticate and deliver to the bearer or holder of such permanent Global Note duly executed and authenticated definitive Debt Securities with the same issue date and maturity date as set out in such permanent Global Note.

Section 5.02.
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series may declare the principal amount (or, if any Debt Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Discount Securities as may be specified in the terms of such Discount Securities) of all the Debt Securities of such series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable. Upon payment of such amount in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are payable (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Sections 3.01 or 3.10), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal of the Debt Securities of such series shall terminate.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Debt Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
 
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum in the Currency in which such Debt Securities are payable (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.10) sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue installments of interest on all Debt Securities or all overdue payments with respect to any Coupons of such series,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Debt Securities of such series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Debt Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest on each Debt Security of such series or upon overdue payments on any Coupons of such series at the Overdue Rate, and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; , , that all sums payable under this clause (D) shall be paid in Dollars; and
provided
however
(2) All Events of Default with respect to Debt Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Debt Securities of such series which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 5.03.
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if
(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Debt Security or any payment with respect to any Coupons when such interest or payment becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) default is made in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debt Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Debt Securities or of such Coupons, the amount then due and payable on such Debt Securities or matured Coupons, for the principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and upon overdue installments of interest, at the Overdue Rate; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel other than any such compensation, expenses, disbursement, or advances which result from the Trustee's negligence or bad faith.
 
If the Company fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and Coupons, and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Debt Securities and Coupons wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Debt Securities and Coupons of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
Section 5.04.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceedings, or any voluntary or involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of a particular series or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of such Debt Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration of acceleration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (or, if the Debt Securities of such series are Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be due and payable with respect to such series pursuant to a declaration in accordance with Section 5.02) (and premium, if any) and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Debt Securities and Coupons of such series and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel other than any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances which result from the Trustee's negligence or bad faith) and of the Holders of such Debt Securities and Coupons allowed in such judicial proceeding, and
(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each such Holder to make such payments to the
 
Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 other than any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances which result from the Trustee's negligence or bad faith.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt Securities and any Coupons of such series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Section 5.11.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation
 
to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Debt Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Debt Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Debt Securities. In case any Debt Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.

Section 6.14.
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
As long as any Debt Securities of a series remain Outstanding, upon a Company Request, there shall be an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") appointed, for such period as the Company shall elect, by the Trustee for such series of Debt Securities to act as its agent on its behalf and subject to its direction in connection with the authentication and delivery of each series of Debt Securities for which it is serving as Trustee. Debt Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by such Trustee. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities of any series by the Trustee for such series or to the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee for such series by an Authenticating Agent for such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf of such Trustee by such Authenticating Agent, except that only the Trustee may authenticate Debt Securities upon original issuance and pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof. Such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $10,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Debt Securities for which it served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee for such series or such Authenticating Agent. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the applicable Trustee and to the Company.
Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to one or more or all series of Debt Securities, the Trustee for such series shall upon Company Request appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, and the Company shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Debt Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 1.05. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent herein. The Trustee for the Debt Securities of such series agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable compensation for its services, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payment, subject to the provisions of Section 6.07. The Authenticating Agent for the Debt Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee for such series.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Debt Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
This is one of the series of Debt Securities issued under the within mentioned Indenture.
 
Section 6.15.
Trustee's Application for Instructions from the Company.
Any application by the Trustee for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Trustee, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Trustee under this Indenture and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Trustee in accordance with a proposal included in such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to any earlier date) unless prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Trustee shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 7.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished, destroy any information received by it as Paying Agent (if so acting) hereunder upon delivering to itself as Trustee, not earlier than 45 days after an Interest Payment Date, a list containing the names and addresses of the Holders obtained from such information since the delivery of the next previous list, if any, destroy any list delivered to itself as Trustee which was compiled from information received by it as Paying Agent (if so acting) hereunder upon the receipt of a new list so delivered, and destroy not earlier than two years after filing, any information filed with it pursuant to Section 7.03(c)(2).
(b) If three or more Holders (hereinafter referred to as "applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof that each such applicant has owned a Debt Security for a period of at least six months preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Debt Securities of a particular series (in which case the applicants must hold Debt Securities of such series) or with all Holders of Debt Securities with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Debt Securities and is accompanied by a copy of the form of proxy or other communication which such applicants propose to transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, at its election, either
(i) afford such applicants access to the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), or
(ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of Holders of Debt Securities of such series or of all Debt Securities, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), and as to the approximate cost of mailing to such Holders the form of proxy or other communication, specified in such application.
If the Trustee shall elect not to afford such applicants access to such information, the Trustee shall, upon written inquest of such applicants, mail to the Holders of Debt Securities of such series or all Holders, as the case may be, whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), a copy of
 
the form of proxy or other communication which is specified in such request, with reasonable promptness after a tender to the Trustee of the material to be mailed and of payment, or provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing, unless within five days after such tender, the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interests of the Holders of Debt Securities of such series or all Holders, as the case may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall specify the basis of such opinion.
If the Commission, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that all the objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.
(c) Every Holder of Debt Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with Section 7.02(b), regardless of the source from which such information was derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing of any material pursuant to a request made under Section 7.02(b).

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Debt Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents with respect to any series of Debt Securities and Coupons, it will, by or on each due date (but if payment is to be made outside the United States, at least one Business Day before each due date) of the principal (and
 
premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Securities of such series, deposit with any such Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto, and (unless any such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent with respect to any series of Debt Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

Section 13.03.
Selection by Trustee of Debt Securities to Be Redeemed.
Except in the case of a redemption in whole of the Bearer Securities or the Registered Securities of such series, if less than all the Debt Securities of any series are to be redeemed at the election of the Company, the particular Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Debt Securities of such series in a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 3.02 in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated. The portions of the principal amount of Debt Securities so selected for partial redemption shall be equal to the minimum authorized denominations for Debt Securities of such
 
series pursuant to Section 3.02 in the Currency in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated or any integral multiple thereof, except as otherwise set forth in the applicable form of Debt Securities. In any case when more than one Registered Security of such series is registered in the same name, the Trustee in its discretion may treat the aggregate principal amount so registered as if it were represented by one Registered Security of such series.
If any Debt Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Debt Security so selected, the converted portion of such Debt Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Debt Securities which have been converted during a selection of Debt Securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debt Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Debt Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Debt Securities shall relate, in the case of any Debt Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debt Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 13.04.
Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by the Company, or at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to the Holders of Debt Securities of any series to be redeemed in whole or in part pursuant to this Article Thirteen, in the manner provided in Section 1.05. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. Failure to give such notice, or any defect in such notice to the Holder of any Debt Security of a series designated for redemption, in whole or in part, shall not affect the sufficiency of any notice of redemption with respect to the Holder of any other Debt Security of such series.
All notices of redemption shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date,
(2) the Redemption Price,
(3) that Debt Securities of such series are being redeemed by the Company pursuant to provisions contained in this Indenture or the terms of the Debt Securities of such series or a supplemental indenture establishing such series, if such be the case, together with a brief statement of the facts permitting such redemption,

Section 14.01.
Applicability of Article.
The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Debt Securities of a series except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of such series.
The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, the amount of any cash sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 14.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Debt Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of such series.
Section 14.02.
Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with Debt Securities.
In lieu of making all or any part of a mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Debt Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option, deliver to the Trustee Debt Securities of such series (together with the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company, except Debt Securities of such series which have been redeemed through the application of mandatory sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of the Debt Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order instructing the Trustee to credit such obligations and stating that the Debt Securities of such series were originally issued by the Company by way of bona fide sale or other negotiation for value, that such Debt Securities shall not have been previously so credited. Such Debt Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
provided
Section 14.03.
Redemption of Debt Securities for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Debt Securities (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency or Currencies in which the Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 3.01) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Debt Securities of such series pursuant to Section 14.02 and shall also deliver to the Trustee any Debt Securities to be so delivered. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate, the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Debt Securities of
 
such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the right to deliver or credit Debt Securities as provided in Section 14.02 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series at such time.
Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Debt Securities of such series at the Redemption Price specified in such Debt Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) to the redemption of Debt Securities shall be added to the next sinking fund payment received by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 12.04) for such series and, together with such payment (or such amount so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 12.04) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Debt Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Debt Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Debt Securities of such series at Maturity.
The Trustee shall select or cause to be selected the Debt Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 13.03 and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 13.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Debt Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 13.06.
On or before (but, if payment is to be made outside the United States, at least one Business Day prior to) each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 12.04) in cash a sum, in the Currency or Currencies in which Debt Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Sections 3.01 or 3.10), equal to the principal and any interest accrued to the Redemption Date for Debt Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.
Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Debt Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Debt Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Debt Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, except that if the notice of redemption shall have been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company, if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such Debt Securities if cash sufficient for that
 
purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of the Debt Securities and Coupons, if any, of such series; , , that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on or prior to the next sinking fund payment date for the Debt Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section.

Defeasance Upon Deposit of Moneys or U.S. Government Obligations.
At the Company's option, either (a) the Company shall be deemed to have been Discharged (as defined below) from its obligations with respect to Debt Securities of any series ("legal defeasance option") or (b) the Company shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.01 and 10.02 with respect to Debt Securities of any series (and, if so specified pursuant to Section 3.01, any other obligation of the Company or restrictive covenant added for the benefit of such series pursuant to Section 3.01) ("covenant defeasance option") at any time after the applicable conditions set forth below have been satisfied:

(2) such deposit shall not cause the Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that series to have a conflicting interest as defined in the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the Debt Securities of any series;
(3) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound;
(4) if the Debt Securities of such series are then listed on any national securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel or a letter or other document from such exchange to the effect that the Company's exercise of its option under this Section would not cause such Debt Securities to be delisted;
(5) no Event of Default or event (including such deposit) which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit and, with respect to the legal defeasance option only, no Event of Default under Section 5.01(5) or Section 5.01(6) or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default under Section 5.01(5) or Section 5.01(6) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after such date; and
(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of the Debt Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance or Discharge.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option and an Event of Default under Section 5.01(5) or Section 5.01(6) or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default under Section 5.01(5) or Section 5.01(6) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after the date of such deposit, the obligations of the Company referred to under the definition of covenant defeasance option with respect to such Debt Securities shall be reinstated.
"Discharged" means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and obligations under, the Debt Securities of such series and to have satisfied all the obligations under this Indenture relating to the Debt Securities of such series (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except (A) the rights of Holders of Debt Securities of such series to receive, from the trust fund described in clause (1) above, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to the Debt Securities of such series under Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 12.03 and 15.03 and (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder.

Applicability; Conversion Privilege.
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, the provisions of this Article Sixteen shall be applicable to any Debt Securities that are convertible into Equity Securities. Each reference in this Article to a "Debt Security" or "Debt Securities" refers to the Debt Securities of a particular series that is convertible into Equity Securities, and references to a "Coupon" or "Coupons" refer to the Coupons appertaining to the Debt Securities of such series.

any time, (i) the provisions of this Article shall be applied separately to each such series, and (ii) references to the Trustee refer to the Trustee for the Debt Securities of such series. If so provided pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of any series, the Holder of a Debt Security of such series shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to convert, in accordance with the terms of such series of Debt Securities and this Article Sixteen, all or any part (if the portion to be converted and the remaining portion of such Debt Security are in authorized denominations for that series of Debt Securities) of such Debt Security into shares of Equity Securities, at any time during the period specified in the terms of the Debt Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.01, at the Conversion Price in effect on the date of conversion, or, as to any Debt Securities called for redemption, at any time prior to the time and date fixed for such redemption (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price, in which case such right shall not terminate at such time and date).
Section 16.02.
Conversion Procedure; Conversion Price; Fractional Shares.
(a) Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Debt Securities of any series, each Debt Security of such series to which this Article is applicable shall be convertible at the office of the Conversion Agent, and at such other place or places, if any, specified pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to the Debt Securities of such series, into fully paid and nonassessable shares (calculated to the nearest 1/100th of a share) of Equity Securities. The Debt Securities will be converted into shares of Equity Securities at the Conversion Price therefor. No payment or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends on the Equity Securities or accrued interest on a converted Debt Security except as described in Section 16.09 and Section 16.02(c). The Company may, but shall not be required, in connection with any conversion of Debt Securities, to issue a fraction of a share of any Equity Security and, if the Company shall determine not to issue any such fraction, the Company shall, subject to Section 16.03(4), make a cash payment (calculated to the nearest cent) equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of such Equity Security on the last Trading Day prior to the date of conversion.
(b) Before any Holder of a Debt Security shall be entitled to convert the same into Equity Securities, such Holder shall surrender such Debt Security duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, or, in the case of Bearer Securities, together with all unmatured Coupons and any matured Coupons in default attached thereto, at the office of the Conversion Agent or at such other place or places, if any, specified pursuant to Section 3.01 (in the case of Registered Securities) and at an office of the Conversion Agent or at such other place or places, if any, outside of the United States as is specified pursuant to Section 3.01 (in the case of Bearer Securities), and shall give written notice to the Company at said office or place that he elects to convert the same and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Debt Securities to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which he wishes the certificate or certificates for Equity Securities to be issued.
If more than one Debt Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Equity Securities which shall be deliverable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. Subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Company will, as soon as practicable after the surrender of a
 
Debt Security for conversion, issue and deliver at said office or place to the Holder of a Debt Security or to his nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of full shares of Equity Securities to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid, together, subject to the last sentence of paragraph (a) above, with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share to which he would otherwise be entitled. The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares of Equity Securities while the stock transfer books for such stock or the Security Register are duly closed for any purpose, but certificates for shares of Equity Securities shall be issued and delivered as soon as practicable after the opening of such books or Security Register.
(c) If, at the time of surrender pursuant to Section 16.02(a), the Holder of a Bearer security is unable to produce all unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such conversion may be effected if the Bearer Securities to be surrendered for conversion are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Bearer Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; , , that except as otherwise provided in Section 12.03, interest represented by Coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States.
provided
however
(d) A Debt Security shall be deemed to have been converted as of the close of business on the date of the surrender of such Debt Security for conversion as provided above, and the Person or Persons entitled to receive the Equity Securities issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record Holder or Holders of such Equity Securities as of the close of business on such date.
(e) In case any Debt Security shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the Holder of the Debt Securities so surrendered, without charge to such Holder (subject to the provisions of Section 16.08), a new Debt Security or Securities in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debt Security, together, in the case of Bearer Securities, with any unmatured Coupons and matured Coupons in default attached thereto.
Section 16.03.
Adjustment of Conversion Price for Equity Securities.
The Conversion Price with respect to any Debt Security which is convertible into Equity Securities shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
(1) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend in shares of an Equity Security to holders of such class of Equity Security, (ii) combine its outstanding shares of an Equity Security into a smaller number of shares of that Equity Security, (iii) subdivide its outstanding shares of an Equity Security into a greater number of shares of that Equity
 
Security or (iv) make a distribution in shares of an Equity Security to holders of such Equity Security, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such action shall be adjusted so that the Holders of such Debt Securities, upon conversion thereof into Equity Securities immediately following such event, shall be entitled to receive the kind and amount of shares of capital stock of the Company which they would have owned or been entitled to receive upon or by reason of such event if such Debt Securities had been converted immediately before the record date (or, if no record date, the effective date) for such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 16.03(1) shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective retroactively immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. For the purposes of this Section 16.03(1), each Holder of Debt Securities shall be deemed to have failed to exercise any right to elect the kind or amount of securities receivable upon the payment of any such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution (provided that if the kind or amount of securities receivable upon such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution is not the same for each nonelecting share, then the kind and amount of securities or other property receivable upon such dividend, subdivision, combination or distribution for each nonelecting share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the nonelecting shares).
(2) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are Outstanding, issue rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of shares of a class of its Equity Securities into which Debt Securities are convertible entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for such issuance) to subscribe for or purchase shares of such Equity Security (or securities convertible into shares of such Equity Security) at a price per share less than the Current Market Price of the Equity Security at such record date (treating the price per share of the securities convertible into such Equity Security as equal to (x) the sum of (i) the price for a unit of the security convertible into such Equity Security and (ii) any additional consideration initially payable upon the conversion of such security into such Equity Security divided by (y) the number of shares of such Equity Security initially underlying such convertible security), the Conversion Price with respect to such Debt Securities shall be adjusted, so that it shall equal the price determined by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights or warrants by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of such Equity Security outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of additional shares of such Equity Security offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so offered are initially convertible), and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of such Equity Security outstanding on the date of issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of shares or securities which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares or securities so offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate purchase price of the convertible securities so offered plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon conversion of such securities into such Equity Security) would purchase at such Current Market Price of such Equity Security. Such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants.
 
(3) In case the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of such Debt Securities are outstanding, distribute to all or substantially all holders of shares of a class of its Equity Securities into which Debt Securities are convertible (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and such Equity Security is not changed or exchanged) cash, evidences of its indebtedness, securities or assets (excluding (i) regular periodic cash dividends in amounts, if any, determined from time to time by the Board of Directors (to the extent paid from current or retained earnings of the Company) or (ii) dividends payable in shares of such Equity Security for which adjustment is made under Section 16.03(1)) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase securities of the Company (excluding those referred to in Section 16.03(2)), then in each such case the Conversion Price with respect to such Debt Securities shall be adjusted so that it shall equal the price determined by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of such Equity Security on the record date referred to below, and the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of such Equity Security less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the cash or assets or evidences of indebtedness or securities so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of such Equity Security (provided that such denominator shall never be less than 1.0); , , that no adjustment shall be made with respect to any distribution of rights to purchase securities of the Company if a Holder of Debt Securities would otherwise be entitled to receive such rights upon conversion at any time of such Debt Securities into such Equity Security unless such rights are subsequently redeemed by the Company, in which case such redemption shall be treated for purposes of this section as a dividend on such Equity Security. Such adjustment shall become effective retroactively immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
provided
however
(4) The Company shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by subsections 16.03(1), 16.03(2) and 16.03(3), as shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution of an Equity Security, any subdivision, reclassification or combination of shares of an Equity Security or any issuance of rights or warrants referred to above shall not be taxable to the holders of a class of an Equity Security for United States Federal income tax purposes.
(5) In any case in which this Section 16.03 shall require that any adjustment be made effective as of or retroactively immediately following a record date, the Company may elect to defer (but only for five (5) Trading Days following the filing of the statement referred to in Section 16.05) issuing to the Holder of any Debt Securities converted after such record date the shares of the Equity Security and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Equity Security and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion on the basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment; , , that the Company shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such Holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
provided
however
 
(6) All calculations under this Section 16.03 shall be made to the nearest cent or one-hundredth of a share or security, with one-half cent and 0.005 of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16.03, the Company shall not be required to make any adjustment of the Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such price.

Except as provided in this Section 16.09 and Section 16.02(c), no adjustments in respect of payments of interest on Debt Securities surrendered for conversion or any dividends or distributions or interest on the Equity Securities issued upon conversion shall be made upon the conversion of any Debt Securities.

Trustee's Disclaimer.
The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment of the Conversion Price should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The Trustee makes no representation and shall not be accountable as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Debt Securities. The Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with this Article.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION:
This is one of the Debt Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (the "Debt Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to the Indenture, to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Debt Securities. The Debt Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided in the Indenture. This Security is one of a series designated as the 9.625% Senior Notes Due April 15, 2015 of the Company, in initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million (the "Securities").
 
The Company promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at the rate of 9.625% per annum.
The Company will pay interest semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing October 15, 2009 (being 195 days interest). Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid on the Securities, from March 31, 2009. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The Company shall pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy laws) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace period) and on overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at the same rate per annum, in each case to the extent lawful.
 
The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except Defaulted Interest) to the persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for ("Defaulted Interest") may be paid to the persons who are registered Holders at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, or in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may then be listed if such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee, as more fully provided in the Indenture. The Company shall pay principal, premium, if any, and interest in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments in respect of a Global Security (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Depositary.
 
Payments in respect of Securities in definitive form (including principal, premium, if any, and interest) will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose within The City of New York or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders on the relevant record date at their addresses set forth in the Debt Security register of Holders or at the option of the Holder, payment of interest on Securities in definitive form will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to any account maintained in the United States, provided such Holder has requested such method of payment and provided timely wire transfer instructions to the paying agent. The Holder must surrender this Security to a paying agent to collect payment of principal.
 
Initially, U.S. Bank National Association will act as paying agent and Registrar. The Company may change any paying agent or Registrar at any time upon notice to the Trustee and the Holders. The Company may act as paying agent.
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Debt Securities of the Company issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture.
Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Original Indenture, those made part of the Indenture by reference to the TIA, as in effect on the date of the Original Indenture, and those terms stated in the First Supplemental Indenture. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and Holders of Securities are referred to the Original Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the TIA for a statement of them. The Securities of this series are general unsecured obligations of the Company limited to an initial aggregate principal amount of $250 million; provided, however, that the authorized aggregate principal amount of such series may be increased from time to time as provided in the First Supplemental Indenture.
 
The Securities are redeemable, at the option of the Company, at any time in whole, or from time to time in part, at a redemption price (the "Make-Whole Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments on the Securities discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points; plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the Redemption Date.
The actual Make-Whole Price, calculated as provided above, shall be calculated and certified to the Trustee and the Company by the Independent Investment Banker. For purposes of determining the Make-Whole Price, the following definitions are applicable:
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the arithmetic average of the bid and ask prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) on the third business day before such Redemption Date, as published in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities" or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not available or does not contain such prices on such business day, the arithmetic average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors; provided, however, that if either Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefore another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and ask prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer by 5:00 p.m. on the third business day before such redemption date.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal of the Securities to be redeemed and interest thereon that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption, provided, however, that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
Except as set forth above, the Securities will not be redeemable prior to their Stated Maturity and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
Securities called for optional redemption become due on the Redemption Date. Notices of optional redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of optional redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the Redemption Date, the method of calculating such redemption price and the place(s) that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to
 
be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Redemption Date with respect to any Securities that have been called for optional redemption. If less than all the Securities are redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Securities to be redeemed on a pro rata basis, by lot or by any other method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that if at the time of redemption such Securities are represented by a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Securities held by each beneficial owner to be redeemed.
The Securities may be redeemed in part in multiplies of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof only. Any such redemption will also comply with Article Thirteen of the Indenture.
 
The Securities are to be issued in registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register the transfer of, or exchange, Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.
 
The registered Holder of a Security may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture may be amended or supplemented, and any existing Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be waived, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of each series affected. Without consent of any Holder of a Security, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture to, among other things, cure any ambiguity or omission, to correct any defect or inconsistency, or to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of a Security. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Securities which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, if at any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind such declaration and
 
annul its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court already rendered and if all Events of Default with respect to the Securities, other than the nonpayment of the principal amount of the Securities, which has become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or shall have been waived. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon. Holders of the Securities may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require reasonable indemnity or security before it enforces the Indenture or the Securities. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.
 
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates or any subsidiary of the Company's Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates as if it were not the Trustee.
 
This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Security.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (tenant in common), TEN ENT (tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (Custodian), and U/G/M/A (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Note Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such number as printed on the Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Security in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
 
This Security shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York.
 
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription on the face of this instrument, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:
