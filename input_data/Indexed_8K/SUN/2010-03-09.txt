On Thursday, March 4, 2010, the Board of Directors ("Board") of Sunoco, Inc. ("Sunoco") approved the following director nominees to stand for election at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders scheduled for Thursday, May 6, 2010: Gary W. Edwards, Lynn L. Elsenhans, Ursula O. Fairbairn, Rosemarie B. Greco, John P. Jones, III, James G. Kaiser, John W. Rowe, and John K. Wulff. In this connection, Thomas P. Gerrity, a director of Sunoco since 1990, notified the Board of his decision to not stand for re-election as a director at the Annual Meeting. Dr. Gerrity's decision was not the result of any disagreement with Sunoco. In addition, Robert J. Darnall, a Sunoco director since 2000, will not be standing for re-election due to Sunoco's mandatory retirement policy for directors.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
