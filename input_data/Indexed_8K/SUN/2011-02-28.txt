Mine Act
On February 24, 2011, Dominion Coal Corporation, a subsidiary of Sunoco, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act at the Dominion No. 36 mine. The order was issued after a continuous mining machine inadvertently mined into an active gas well owned by Equitable Gas. Immediately after the incident, power was shut off to the mine and all miners were notified to evacuate the entire mine. No injuries, fire, or damage to equipment occurred.
Federal, State and gas company officials were notified immediately. Gas company officials disconnected the well from the surface gas collection line and the well was temporarily neutralized. On February 25, 2011, the mine was examined and levels of gas were found to be at safe levels. No damage to equipment or air courses within the mine have resulted from this incident and power has been restored to the mine to allow routine maintenance activities. We expect that production at the mine will resume once the gas well has been permanently sealed in accordance with plans approved by MSHA and state mine officials.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
