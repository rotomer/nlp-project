(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, Sunoco and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, Sunoco and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, Sunoco and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the
Contribution.
 
Company, Sunoco and the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters; that for purposes of this Section 9(e), Sunoco shall be deemed to have received the net proceeds from the offering of Securities sold by the Selling Stockholder. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, Sunoco, the Selling Stockholder or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company, Sunoco, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9(e).

Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts
 
(a) The parties intend that any Liability subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Article V or Article VI will be net of Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of the Liability. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an "") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in respect of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an "") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
Indemnifying Party
Indemnitee
Indemnity Payment
(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (, a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement shall obligate any member of any Group to seek to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds.
i.e.
(c) The parties intend that any indemnification or reimbursement payment in respect of a Liability pursuant to this Article V or Article VI shall be (i) reduced to take into account the amount of any Tax Benefit (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement) to the indemnified or reimbursed Person resulting from the Liability so indemnified or reimbursed and (ii) increased so that the amount of such payment, reduced by the amount of all Income Taxes (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement) payable with respect to the receipt thereof (but taking into account all correlative Tax Benefits resulting from the payment of such Income Taxes), shall equal the amount of the payment which the Person receiving such payment would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5.4(c), the amount of any Tax Benefit and any Income Taxes shall be calculated on the basis that the indemnified or reimbursed Person is subject to the highest marginal regular statutory income Tax rate, has sufficient taxable income to permit the realization or receipt of any relevant Tax Benefit at the earliest possible time and is not subject to the alternative minimum tax.
 
5.5. .
Procedures for Indemnification of Third-Party Claims
(a) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the Sunoco Group or the SunCoke Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (collectively, a "") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 5.2 or 5.3, or any other Section of this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof within 20 days after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of an Indemnitee to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a) shall not relieve an Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent to which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by the Indemnitee's failure to provide notice in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).
Third-Party Claim
(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and, unless the Indemnifying Party has specified any reservations or exceptions, to seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third-Party Claim. Within 30 days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 5.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee except as set forth in the next sentence. In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.
(c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 5.5(d), such Indemnitee may defend such Third-Party Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.
(d) Unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, no Indemnitee may settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.
(e) In the case of a Third-Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other order or other non-monetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly against any Indemnitee.
(f) The above provisions of this Section 5.5 and the provisions of Section 5.6 do not apply to Taxes (Taxes being governed by the Tax Sharing Agreement). In the case of any conflict between this Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement in relation to any matters addressed by the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Tax Sharing Agreement shall prevail.
5.6. .
Additional Matters
(a) Indemnification payments in respect of any Liabilities for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee as such Liabilities are incurred upon demand by the Indemnitee, including reasonably satisfactory documentation setting forth the basis for the amount of such indemnification payment, including documentation with respect to calculations made and
Article V
 
consideration of any Insurance Proceeds that actually reduce the amount of such Liabilities. The indemnity agreements contained in this shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee, (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Liabilities for which it might be entitled to indemnification hereunder and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
Article V
(b) Any claim on account of a Liability which does not result from a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
(c) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(d) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if either the Indemnitee or Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this section, the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.
5.7. The remedies provided in this Article V shall be cumulative and, subject to the provisions of Article X, shall not preclude assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party.
Remedies Cumulative.
5.8. . The rights and obligations of each of Sunoco and SunCoke and their respective Indemnitees under this Article V shall survive the sale or other transfer by any party of any Assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities.

Subject to Section 6.1(g), SunCoke will give Sunoco as much prior notice as reasonably practicable of any proposed determination of, or any significant changes in, SunCoke's accounting estimates or accounting principles from those in effect on the IPO Closing Date. SunCoke will consult with Sunoco and, if requested by Sunoco, SunCoke will consult with Sunoco's Auditors with respect thereto.

Notice of Changes

In the event an insurance policy aggregate is exhausted, or believed likely to be exhausted, due to noticed claims, the SunCoke Group, on the one hand, and the Sunoco Group, on the other hand, shall be responsible for their portion of the reinstatement premium, based upon the losses of such Group submitted to Sunoco's insurance carrier(s) (including any submissions prior to the Distribution Date). To the extent that the Sunoco Group or the SunCoke Group is allocated more than its portion of such premium due to the timing of losses submitted to Sunoco's insurance carrier(s), the other party shall promptly pay the first party an amount so that each Group has been properly allocated its portion of the reinstatement premium. Sunoco and SunCoke can mutually agree not to reinstate the policy aggregate and each Group then will bear all of its own future costs.
