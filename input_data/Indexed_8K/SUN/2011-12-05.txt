Information Regarding the Spin-off Transaction
SunCoke is a leading independent coke producer in North America, and this business has attractive global growth potential. Sunoco's Board of Directors believes that the separation of SunCoke from Sunoco will aid SunCoke by providing it with independent access to capital markets to finance its
growth, enlarge its scale and enhance its ability to take advantage of domestic and international opportunities. In addition, the separation will improve management focus and strategic focus and enhance employee hiring and retention. Following the separation, SunCoke should be able to focus solely on pursuing the business development strategies that its management team believes are most appropriate for optimal growth and operation, thus better positioning SunCoke to serve its customers who are the world's leading steel manufacturers.
No vote or action is required by Sunoco's shareholders in order to receive the special stock dividend of shares of SunCoke common stock.

Trading in Shares of Sunoco Common Stock Between Record Date and Distribution Date
From the Record Date and up to and including the Distribution Date, there will be two markets in Sunoco common stock and in SunCoke common stock, a "regular way" market and a "when-issued" market. Shares of Sunoco common stock that trade in the regular way market will carry an entitlement to the special stock dividend of shares of SunCoke common stock. Therefore, if you own shares of Sunoco common stock and sell those shares in the regular way market prior to or on the Distribution Date, you also will be selling your right to receive the special stock dividend of shares of SunCoke common stock. The New York Stock Exchange is expected to authorize a when-issued market for Sunoco common stock on or about two business days prior to the Record Date. Shares of Sunoco common stock that trade on the when-issued market under the symbol "SUN.wi" will trade without the right to receive shares of SunCoke common stock in connection with the distribution. It also is expected that a when-issued market for the shares of SunCoke common stock to be distributed in the spin-off will develop on or about two business days prior to the Record Date on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SXC.wi."
If you sell your shares of Sunoco common stock prior to or on the Distribution Date, you also may be selling your right to receive the special stock dividend of shares of SunCoke common stock. You are encouraged to consult your financial advisor regarding the specific implications of selling Sunoco common stock prior to or on the Distribution Date.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
Sunoco has obtained a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the distribution by Sunoco of the shares of SunCoke common stock held by Sunoco will qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a distribution in which Sunoco shareholders will not recognize gain or loss, except for any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of SunCoke common stock. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences of the distribution to you in your specific circumstances, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign tax laws. Sunoco will provide its shareholders with information to enable them to compute their tax basis in both
Sunoco common stock and SunCoke common stock. This information will be posted under the Investor Relations tab on Sunoco's website at www.sunocoinc.com and SunCoke's website at www.suncoke.com.

Philadelphia, December 1, 2011  Sunoco, Inc. (NYSE: SUN) announced today that it is indefinitely idling the main processing units at its refinery in Marcus Hook, Penn., due to deteriorating refining market conditions. The company now expects to begin idling the Marcus Hook facility immediately while it continues to seek a buyer and also pursues options with third parties for alternate uses of the facility.
The company also intends to increase the capacity utilization rate of its Philadelphia refinery and will continue to operate the refinery as long as market conditions warrant. However, if a suitable sales transaction cannot be implemented, the company intends to permanently idle the main processing units at the Philadelphia refinery no later than July 2012.
"Market conditions have deteriorated significantly and the outlook for both motor fuel demand and refining margins remains weak," said Lynn L. Elsenhans, Sunoco's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our retail and logistics businesses are performing well, but given the negative realities of the Northeast refining marketplace, we need to accelerate the timeline for idling our Marcus Hook processing units."
Sunoco will redeploy salaried Marcus Hook refinery employees to other positions within the company where possible. Salaried employees who are not redeployed are eligible for severance benefits and job placement services. The company will enter into effects bargaining with union officials regarding idling the facility. Represented employees will continue to work or receive wages and benefits for 90 days, as provided by the existing labor contract.
"This was a very difficult decision given the impacts to employees and nearby communities, and we will work closely with them throughout this process," Elsenhans said.
