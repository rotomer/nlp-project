The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK) announced today that it has completed an offering of $350 million in aggregate principal amount of notes. The offering was comprised of $200 million of 4.90% notes due 2012 and $150 million of 3.50% notes due 2007. The company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the purchase price of the proposed acquisition of Best Lock Corporation dba Best Access Systems. Any amounts not used for the Best Lock acquisition will be used for general corporate purposes. The notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to persons outside the United States under Regulation S. The notes were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any state in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. Any statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those the company anticipates.
