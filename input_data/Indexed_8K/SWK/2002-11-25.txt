Exhibit 20(i) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Stanley Works Completes Acquisition Of Best Access Systems New Britain, Connecticut, November 25, 2002: The Stanley Works (NYSE: "SWK") announced today that it has completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Best Lock Corporation dba Best Access Systems. Best Access Systems is a global provider of security access control systems with $250 million in sales. Its products include mechanical access hardware and electronic access controls that are used in government offices, military facilities, hospitals, commercial buildings and educational facilities worldwide. The addition of Best Access Systems is a significant step in enabling Stanley to build service and technology infrastructures in the very large security and safety market. By combining its current automatic door, commercial hardware and service businesses with Best Access' mechanical and electronic locking, service and systems integration, Stanley will have a $450 million platform in this market. Management expects to build upon this platform both organically and through acquisitions. Stanley financed the $310 million cash purchase with proceeds from its recently completed debt offering of $200 million of 4.90% notes due 2012 and $150 million of 3.50% notes due 2007. Management expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and to generate a return that covers Stanley's cost of capital in the first year of ownership. Integration plans have been developed and will begin to be implemented before year-end. The Stanley Works, an S&P 500 company, is a worldwide supplier of tools, hardware and doors for professional, industrial and consumer use.
