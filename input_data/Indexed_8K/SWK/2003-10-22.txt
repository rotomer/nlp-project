Exhibit 20(i) ------------- THE STANLEY WORKS Third Quarter EPS At High End of Guided Range EPS Ex-Charges Exceeds Guidance On Stronger Than Expected Sales; Record Quarterly Free Cash Flow Tops $138 Million New Britain, Connecticut, October 22, 2003 ... The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK) announced that third quarter 2003 net income was $42 million (51 cents per fully-diluted share) compared with $55 million (62 cents per fully-diluted share) last year, and within the range of company estimates of 39-51 cents provided July 22. This result included $17 million (14 cents per fully diluted share) of pre-tax restructuring costs, impairment charges and other exit costs related to its previously announced Operation 15 business improvement initiatives. Aside from such costs, earnings per fully diluted share were 65 cents, above the company's range of estimates of 60-63 cents, versus 62 cents last year. Reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2003 and 2002 are supplemented with related amounts and percentages that exclude restructuring costs, impairment charges, other exit costs, one-time executive retirement costs and a 2002 pension gain. Management believes these supplemental financial measures provide useful information by removing the effect of variances in reported results that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the company's earnings capacity. A full reconciliation with reported amounts is included on pages 9-10. Refer to previous 8K filings or to www.stanleyworks.com for first and second quarter reconciliations to reported amounts. Free cash flow before dividends (cash from operations less capital expenditures) of $138 million was up 48% over $93 million last year. Debt reduction of $77 million in the quarter improved the company's debt-to-total capital ratio from 54% to 51%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was 43% higher ($239 million versus $166 million last year). Net sales were $716 million, up 8% over last year and slightly above expectations. Exclusive of the Best Access Systems acquisition and the decline from exiting the Mac Direct business, sales declined 1% with currency adding 2%. Sales in the consumer channel decreased principally due to the carryover impact of a lost region of a major customer in entry doors that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. Third quarter 2003 gross income was $239 million, or 33.4% of sales, versus $210 million in the prior year, a margin improvement of 190 basis points. The margin improvement resulted from the inclusion of Best Access, stabilization of pricing levels / mix and the realization of productivity benefits. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses of $148 million, or 20.7% of sales, were $15 million and 70 bps above third quarter 2002 levels, reflecting the inclusion of Best Access Systems. SG&A expenses were $7 million and 140 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2003, aside from aforementioned Mac Direct exit and other costs, reflecting the continued benefits of Operation 15 actions.

Resulting operating income was $91 million versus $77 million last year, and operating margins were 12.8% versus 11.5% last year. On a sequential basis operating margins of 12.8% improved over 11.5% in second quarter and 9.0% in the first quarter of 2003, exclusive of aforementioned Mac Direct exit and other restructing costs included in those prior quarters. This sequential improvement is attributed to volume leverage, the benefits of organization streamlining, the exit of Mac Direct and employment reductions accomplished through Operation 15 actions. Other, net expense in the third quarter increased $9 million, aside from exit and other costs, primarily due to increased intangible amortization expense and the absence of certain prior year environmental and asset disposition gains. John M. Trani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented: "Operation 15 is on track to deliver expected savings, and achievement of the 15% rate is within our grasp. The sequential improvements in operating margin rate and record cash generation clearly stand out as the most encouraging aspects of the third quarter results. Our business model is working as anticipated, with record free cash flow being utilized for dividends, debt reduction and pursuing plans for growth in our Security Solutions and Tools Groups." Tools segment sales of $487 million were 2% lower than last year, principally reflecting the impact of the Mac Direct exit, somewhat offset by strong volume in the traditional Mac Tools and auto assembly tools businesses. Operating margins were 11.4% versus 10.4% last year, and notably improved by 210 and 270 basis points sequentially over the second and first quarters, respectively, excluding exit charges and other restructuring costs, due to the impact of Operation 15. Doors segment sales increased 36% to $229 million, but organic sales declined 3% as weakness in consumer doors more than offset growth in Access Technologies. Door Systems were adversely affected by the previously announced loss of one region of a major retail customer in addition to customer inventory reductions. Doors operating margins were 15.8% versus 14.8% last year and improved 610 basis points in the past six months, excluding exit charges and other restructuring costs, due to volume and the benefits of the Best Access Systems integration. Improved mix due to inclusion of Best Access was primarily responsible for the margin gain versus the prior year. The company incurred $17 million of pre-tax restructuring, impairment and other charges related to its Operation 15 initiatives. A summary of the pre-tax charges recorded in 2003 and referred to above follows: Third ($ millions) First Half Quarter Year-To-Date ---------- ------- ------------ Operation 15 Mac Direct $ 42 $ 6 $ 48 Other 12 11 23 ----- ----- ----- Total Operation 15 $ 54 $ 17 $ 71 Severance 3 - 3 CEO Retirement 8 - 8 ----- ----- ----- Total $ 65 $ 17 $ 82 Page 6 of 17
The charges pertaining to Operation 15 are within the expected range communicated during the company's May 8 analyst meeting. The company expects additional charges to be incurred in the next few quarters in connection with this profit improvement initiative. Despite continuing weak sales, primarily in consumer tools and entry doors, the company expects a fourth quarter net sales increase of about 7% over the prior year. Earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of 50-55 cents and, aside from 9-11 cents of expected charges related to Operation 15 actions, in the range of 61-64 cents versus 42 cents last year on a comparable basis. On a basis which excludes restructuring, impairment and other charges, the current full-year 2003 First Call consensus of $2.15 per share is within the range of management expectations, aside from such charges. During the third quarter, the company sold a substantial portion of its Mac Tools distributor financing receivables for $26 million cash. The company plans to sell the remainder of these receivables during the fourth quarter and to minimize future exposure to such credit risk. The favorable aspects of the Mac Tools repositioning and related asset liquidations enable the company to forecast higher full-year earnings than the $1.10 per share previously indicated on July 22, 2003. Full year earnings are now expected to approximate $1.36 - $1.41 per fully diluted share, with the aforementioned restructuring costs, impairment charges, other exit costs and one-time expenses approximating 74-76 cents per share. The company is now projecting that fourth quarter free cash flow (before dividends) will approximate $100 million, resulting in about $340 million for 2003. This represents a 55% improvement over the $220 million forcasted at the company's May 8 analyst conference, and will far surpass the record free cash flow of $233 million in 2002. In this regard, the company indicated that operating and free cash flows are far exceeding management's previous estimates. Mr. Trani added: "The combined free cash generated in 2002 and projected for 2003 will be over $570 million, about the same amount generated in the previous five year period 1997-2001. Our record third quarter and expected fourth quarter performances should position us very nicely going forward." During the third quarter, the company entered into a contract in the Tools segment that will involve acquisition of assets, as well as marketing, sourcing and manufacturing cooperation. The contract is subject to certain contingencies expected to be resolved during the fourth quarter, at which time the company will invest $30 million cash. Page 7 of 17 Pages
