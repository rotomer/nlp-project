Exhibit 20(i) ------------- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE THE STANLEY WORKS ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF CST/BERGER New Britain, Connecticut, December 12, 2003 ... The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wateska, Illinois-based Chicago Steel Tape Co. and certain related assets and affiliated companies that are collectively known as CST/Berger, a leading designer and manufacturer of laser and optical leveling and measuring equipment, for $62 million cash. CST/Berger's products include laser and optical surveying, leveling and alignment tools, surveyor supplies and accessories that are sold principally in the Specialty Tools and Fasteners Distributors Association ("STAFDA") channel in the U.S., as well as specialty surveyors' and contractors' supply distributors. John M. Trani, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer stated: "CST/Berger is a strategic bolt-on addition to our Tools Group. We are clearly the global leader in measuring, with unmatched technology, innovative products and the leading global market share in tape rules. Our objective is to move the company from just tape rules to measuring devices and to focus upon professional customers. With its leading market positions in growing categories, CST/Berger meets that objective. "Earlier this week we announced the planned disposition of our residential entry doors business. This CST/Berger acquisition is expected to replace about 35 percent of the revenues and approximately 50 percent of the earnings of the residential entry doors business. This move continues the shift of our portfolio toward favored markets, those with higher inherent growth and profitability. Our two growth platforms - the Tools Group and Security Solutions - will account for over 60 percent of revenues in 2004. Page 5 of 8 Pages
"We expect our portfolio repositioning to continue into 2004. The successful Best Access Systems integration demonstrated our ability to do so." The Closing for this transaction is subject to certain approvals, third-party consents and customary conditions, and is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2004. The Stanley Works, an S&P 500 company, is a worldwide supplier of tools, hardware and door systems for professional, industrial and consumer use.

The company's ability to deliver the results as described above (the "Results") is based on current expectations and involves inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and other factors that could delay, divert, or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations. The company's ability to deliver the Results is dependent upon (i) the satisfaction of customary conditions and the receipt of necessary third-party consents and approvals regarding the Acquisition within anticipated time frames; (ii) the successful integration of the acquired business with the companies' existing businesses; (iii) the success of the company's efforts to decentralize its operations functions, primarily in its Tools and Security Solutions business groups; (iv) the success of the company's efforts to reduce its workforce and close certain facilities, including the resolution of any labor issues related to such activities, the need to respond to significant changes in product demand while any facility consolidation is in process and other unforeseen events; (v) continued improvements in productivity and cost reductions; and (vi) the continued improvement in the payment terms under which the company buys and sells goods, materials and products. The company's ability to deliver the Results is also dependent upon (i) the continued success of the company's marketing and sales efforts, including the company's ability to recruit and retain an adequate sales force; (ii) the continued success of The Home Depot and Wal-Mart sales initiatives as well as other programs to stimulate demand for company products; (iii) the ability of the sales force to adapt to changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage; (iv) the ability of the company to fulfill demand for its products; and (v) the absence of increased pricing pressures from customers and competitors and the ability to defend market share in the face of price competition.
