Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate or rates equal to, at the option of the Registrant, the Eurodollar rate or the prime rate, plus a margin specified in the Credit Agreement for Eurodollar rate advances.
 
The Registrant must repay all advances by the earlier of (i) November 1, 2006 or (ii) the date of termination in whole, at the election of the Registrant, of the commitments by the lenders under the Credit Facility, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Registrant may be required to prepay any borrowings under the Credit Facility upon a change of control and will be required to prepay certain of such borrowings, and the commitments under the Credit Agreement will be reduced, upon the issuance of certain debt or equity by the Registrant or any of its subsidiaries.
 
None of the proceeds from the Credit Facility were drawn down at closing.
 
The Credit Agreement contains covenants that include, among other things:
 
 
 
 
 
The Credit Facility contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Registrant might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.
 
Many of the investment banking firms that are a party to the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have in the past performed, and may in the future from time to time perform, investment banking, financial advisory, lending and/or commercial banking services for the Registrant and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, for which service they have in the past received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.

(iii) if the Required Lenders shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Eurodollar Rate Advance, notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to the Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall have no obligation to make, or convert Committed Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein and not expressly defined herein have the definitions specified in the Credit Agreement.
 
In addition to the Credit Agreement, we have examined originals, certified copies or copies otherwise identified as being true copies of the following:

In addition, we have examined originals or copies authenticated to our satisfaction of such corporate records, certificates of officers and other representatives of the Borrower and public officials, and other documents as we have deemed relevant or necessary in connection with our opinions set forth herein. As to questions of fact material to such opinions we have relied upon the representations of the Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement, certificates of officers and other representatives of the Borrower and factual information we have obtained from such other sources as we have deemed reasonable. We have assumed without investigation that there has been no relevant change or development between the dates as of which the information cited in the preceding sentence was given and the date of this letter. We have not independently verified the accuracy of the matters set forth in the written statements or certificates upon which we have relied, nor have we undertaken any lien, suit or judgment searches or searches of court dockets in any jurisdiction. For purposes of the opinions in paragraph 1 we have relied exclusively upon certificates issued by governmental authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, and such opinion is not intended to provide any conclusion or assurance beyond that conveyed by those certificates.
 
We have assumed: (i) the genuineness and authenticity of all documents examined by us and all signatures thereon, and the conformity to originals of all copies of all documents examined by us; (ii) that the execution, delivery and/or acceptance of the Credit Agreement has been duly authorized by all action, corporate or otherwise, necessary by the parties to the Credit Agreement other than the Borrower (those parties other than the Borrower are hereinafter collectively referred to as the ""); (iii) the legal capacity of all natural persons executing the Credit Agreement; (iv) that each of the Other Parties has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make the Credit Agreement enforceable against it; (v) that the Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Other Parties and is enforceable against the Other Parties in accordance with its terms; (vi) that each of the Other Parties has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce the Credit Agreement; (vii)that the Credit Agreement accurately describes and contains the mutual understandings of the parties, and that there are no oral or written statements or agreements or usages of trade or courses of prior dealings among the parties that would modify, amend or vary any of the terms of the Credit Agreement ; (viii)that the Other Parties will act in accordance with, and will refrain from taking

1. The Borrower is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut.
 
2.
