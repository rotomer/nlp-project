Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On November 22, 2005, The Stanley Works (the "Company") consummated an offering of 450,000 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities (liquidation amount $1,000 per preferred security) (the "Preferred Securities") through its trust subsidiary, The Stanley Works Capital Trust I (the "Trust"). The Preferred Securities were sold at a price of 100% of liquidation amount (or an aggregate gross price of $450 million). Indenture, First Supplemental Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities underlying the Preferred Securities In connection with the sale of the Preferred Securities by the Trust, the Company issued $450,100,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due December 1, 2045 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities") pursuant to a first supplemental indenture, supplementing an indenture, each dated November 22, 2005, between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as indenture trustee (together, the "Indenture"). All of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities were purchased by the Trust with the proceeds the Trust received from the sale of the Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities (as defined below). The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities were sold at a price of 100% of principal amount (or an aggregate gross price of $450.1 million). The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities are general unsecured junior subordinated obligations of the Company and are subordinated in right of payment, to the extent set forth in the Indenture, to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture). The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities bear interest from the date of issuance on November 22, 2005 to December 1, 2010 (the "Fixed Rate Period") at the annual rate of 5.902% of their principal amount, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2006. From December 1, 2010, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities will bear interest at an annual rate reset quarterly of 1.40% plus the highest of the 3-Month LIBOR Rate, the 10-Year Treasury CMT and the 30-Year Treasury CMT (each as defined in the Indenture) for the related quarterly interest accrual period, subject to a limit of 13.25%, payable quarterly on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, beginning March 1, 2011. The Indenture provides that payments of interest are subject to Optional Deferral and Mandatory Deferral provisions. The Company may elect at any time and from time to time to exercise its right of "Optional Deferral" to defer one or more interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. The Company must provide a notice of its election to defer interest no more than 60 and no fewer than 15 days prior to the relevant interest payment date. The Indenture also provides that the Company will be subject to "Mandatory Deferral" and will not be permitted to pay interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in an amount in excess of the New Common Equity Amount (as defined it the Indenture) on any interest payment date if, on the 30th day prior 2
to such interest payment date, the Company does not meet certain financial ratios. The Indenture requires the Company to pay deferred interest only out of the net proceeds of sales of its common stock. Each of Optional Deferral and Mandatory Deferral may not (i) extend beyond the maturity or earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and (ii) continue for more than 10 years, whether because of Optional Deferral or Mandatory Deferral, without all deferred interest being paid in full. The Indenture provides that, beginning with the first to occur of (1) the date that is one year after the first interest payment date for which the Company was required to defer interest because of Mandatory Deferral and (2) the date that is five years after the first interest payment date for which the Company deferred interest because of Optional or Mandatory Deferral, the Company must use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all deferred interest. The Junior Subordinated Debt Securities are redeemable prior to their maturity (1) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to December 1, 2010, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (x) 100% of the principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities being redeemed and (y) as determined by the Quotation Agent (as defined in the Indenture), the sum of the present values of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon to December 1, 2010, discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the Indenture) plus 0.25%, plus in each case, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the redemption date and (2) in whole or in part, at any time from time to time on or after December 1, 2010 at a redemption price equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date. There are also certain redemption provisions in the event certain tax events occur or the Company and the Trust receive a legal opinion that the Trust may be considered an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture, including the form of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities included therein, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. The holders of Senior Indebtedness do not have any rights to enforce any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, other than those that are contained in Article VI-Subordination that are made expressly for the benefit of such holders. Guarantee Agreement Pursuant to the Preferred Securities Guarantee Agreement, dated November 22, 2005, between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as guarantee trustee (the "Guarantee Agreement"), the Company irrevocably and 3
unconditionally has agreed to pay in full on a subordinated basis "guarantee payments" to the holders of the Preferred Securities. To the extent not paid by or on behalf of the Trust, the Company guarantees (1) any accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the Preferred Securities, to the extent that the Trust has funds on hand legally and immediately available therefor at the time; (2) the applicable redemption price with respect to the Preferred Securities called for redemption, to the extent that the Trust has funds on hand legally and immediately available therefor at that time and (3) upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the Trust (other than in connection with the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities held by the Trust to the holders of the Preferred Securities), the lesser of (x) the aggregate of the liquidation amount and all accrued and unpaid distributions on the Preferred Securities, to the extent the Trust has funds on hand legally and immediately available therefor at the time and (y) the amount of assets of the Trust remaining available for distribution to holders of the Preferred Securities after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as required by applicable law. The guarantee constitutes an unsecured obligation of the Company and is subordinate and junior in right of payment to the extent specified in the Guarantee Agreement, to (i) Senior Indebtedness and (ii) the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. The foregoing description of the Guarantee Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Guarantee Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.8 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Preferred Securities The Preferred Securities were issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated November 22, 2005, among the Trust, the Company, HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as property trustee and as Delaware trustee, and the administrative trustees parties thereto (the "Trust Agreement"). Additionally, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trust issued trust common securities (the "Trust Common Securities") with a total liquidation amount of $100,000 to the Company. The Trust Agreement does not permit the Trust to issue any securities other than the Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities. Both the Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The sole assets of the Trust are the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. If there is an event of default under the Trust Agreement, the rights of the holders of the Preferred Securities will be entitled to priority in right of payment over the holders of the Trust Common Securities. The distribution rates and distribution dates for the Preferred Securities and the Trust Common Securities correspond to the interest payments and interest payment dates on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. The amount of funds available to the Trust for distribution to holders of the Preferred Securities is limited to payments under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. 4
In the event of Optional Deferral or Mandatory Deferral with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, distributions on the Preferred Securities will be deferred by the Trust during such interest deferral period. Distributions to which the holders of the Preferred Securities are entitled accumulate additional distributions to the extent of the compounded interest accruing on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. The Preferred Securities have no stated maturity but must be repaid upon the repayment of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities at their stated maturity or upon the earlier redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. When the Company repays or redeems the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, the Trust will simultaneously, subject to certain notice requirements, use the proceeds therefrom to redeem a Like Amount (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Preferred Securities. The foregoing description of the Trust Agreement and the Preferred Securities does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Trust Agreement, including the form of Preferred Security included therein, copies of which are attached as Exhibits 4.9 and 4.10, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Registration Right Agreement In connection with the issuance of the Preferred Securities on November 22, 2005, the Trust and the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers of the Preferred Securities for the benefit of the holders of the Preferred Securities. In the Registration Rights Agreement, the Trust and the Company have agreed, at their cost, to (i) by the 210th day following the closing of the offering on November 22, 2005, file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect to a registered offering to exchange the Preferred Securities for exchange preferred securities (the "Exchange Preferred Securities"), which will have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the Preferred Securities (except that the Exchange Preferred Securities will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions and interest rate increases) and (ii) by the 300th day after the closing of the offering of the Preferred Securities, use their best efforts to cause the exchange offer registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Trust and the Company have agreed to keep the exchange offer open for not less than 20 days (or longer if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the exchange offer is mailed to the holders of the Preferred Securities. In addition, the Trust and the Company have agreed, in certain limited circumstances, to file a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Preferred Securities and to use their best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act and to keep effective the shelf registration statement until the earlier of (x) the second anniversary of the closing of the offering of 5
the Preferred Securities or (y) the date on which no securities requiring registration are outstanding. The Trust and the Company have also agreed that, if (i) they fail to file a registration statement required by the Registration Rights Agreement by the date specified for such filing; (ii) any such registration statement has not been declared effective by the SEC on or prior to the date specified for such effectiveness; or (iii) the applicable registration statement is declared effective but thereafter ceases to be effective during the periods such registration statement is required to be effective as specified in the Registration Rights Agreement, then the sole remedy to the holders will be that the Company will be required to pay "registration default damages" in respect of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities at an annual amount representing 0.25% of the liquidation amount of the then-outstanding registrable Preferred Securities, and the Trust will be required to pay corresponding damages on the registrable Preferred Securities. Following the cure of the registration defaults, the accrual of the damages on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the registerable Preferred Securities will cease. The foregoing description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Registration Rights Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.11 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

ARTICLE II ISSUE, DESCRIPTION, TERMS, EXECUTION, REGISTRATION AND EXCHANGE OF DEBT SECURITIES SECTION 2.01. Designation and Terms of Debt Securities. The aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited. The Debt Securities may be issued in one or more series up to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities of that series from time to time authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution of the Company or, pursuant to one or more indentures supplemental hereto. Prior to the initial issuance of Debt Securities of any series, there shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution of the Company, and set forth in an Officers' Certificate of the Company, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto: (1) the title of the series of Debt Security (which shall distinguish the Debt Securities of that series from all other series of Debt Securities); (2) any limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (except for Debt Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Debt Securities of that series); (3) the date or dates on which the principal of the Debt Securities of that series is payable; (4) the rate or rates at which the Debt Securities of that series shall bear interest or the manner of calculation of such rate or rates, if any; (5) the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which such interest will be payable or the manner of determination of such Interest Payment Dates and the record date for the determination of holders to whom interest is payable on any such Interest Payment Dates; (6) the right, if any, to extend the interest payment periods and the duration of such extension; (7) the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, Debt Securities of that series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company; (8) the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem or purchase Debt Securities of that series pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provisions (including payments made in cash in participation of future sinking fund obligations) or at the option of a holder thereof and the period or periods within 8
which, the price or prices at which, and the terms and conditions upon which, Debt Securities of that series shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; (9) the subordination terms of the Debt Securities of that series; (10) the form of the Debt Securities of that series, including the form of the Certificate of Authentication for such series; (11) if other than denominations of one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof, the denominations in which the Debt Securities of that series shall be issuable; (12) whether and under what circumstances the Company will pay additional amounts on the Debt Securities of the series to any holder or any type of holder of a Debt Security or Trust Security in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge and, if so, whether the Company will have the option to redeem such Debt Securities rather than pay such additional amounts (and the terms of any such option); (13) any and all other terms with respect to such series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Indenture), including any terms which may be required by or advisable under United States laws or regulations or advisable in connection with the marketing of Debt Securities of that series; (14) whether the Debt Securities are issuable as a Global Security and, in such case, the identity of the Depositary for such series; and (15) if applicable, (i) that the Debt Securities of the series, in whole or any specified part, shall be defeasible pursuant to Section 11.02 or Section 11.03 or both such Sections, (ii) the obligations from which the Company shall be released in the event of any such defeasance, and (iii) if other than by a Board Resolution, the manner in which any election by the Company to defease such Debt Securities shall be evidenced. All Debt Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to any such Board Resolution or in any indentures supplemental hereto. If any of the terms of a series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution of the Company, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate of the Company setting forth the terms of such series. SECTION 2.02. Form of Debt Securities and Trustee's Certificate. The Debt Securities of any series and the Trustee's certificate of authentication to be borne by 9
such Debt Securities shall be substantially of the tenor and purport as set forth in one or more indentures supplemental hereto or as provided in a Board Resolution of the Company and as set forth in an Officers' Certificate of the Company, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Debt Securities of that series may be listed, or to conform to usage. SECTION 2.03. Denominations; Provisions for Payment. The Debt Securities shall be issuable as registered Debt Securities and in the denominations of one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof, subject to Section 2.01(11). The Debt Securities of a particular series shall bear interest payable on the dates and at the rate specified with respect to that series. The principal of and the interest on the Debt Securities of any series, as well as any premium thereon in case of redemption thereof prior to maturity, shall be payable in the coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time is legal tender for public and private debt, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York. Each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Subject to Section 2.01(4), interest on the Debt Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months. The interest installment on any Debt Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Debt Securities of that series shall be paid to the Person in whose name said Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment. In the event that any Debt Security of a particular series or portion thereof is called for redemption and the redemption date is subsequent to a regular record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date and prior to such Interest Payment Date, interest on such Debt Security will be paid upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Security as provided in Section 3.03. Any interest on any Debt Security that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Debt Securities of that series (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holder on the relevant regular record date by virtue of having been such holder; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Company, at its election, as provided in clause (1) or clause (2) below: (1) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Debt Securities to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of 10
the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such Debt Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his or her address as it appears in the Security Register (as hereinafter defined), not less than 10 days prior to such special record date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities (or their respective Predecessor Debt Securities) are registered on such special record date and shall be no longer payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Debt Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Debt Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustees of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Unless otherwise set forth in a Board Resolution of the Company or one or more indentures supplemental hereto establishing the terms of any series of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, the term "regular record date" as used in this Section with respect to a series of Debt Securities with respect to any Interest Payment Date for such series shall mean either the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the first day of a month, or the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the fifteenth day of a month, whether or not such date is a Business Day. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Debt Security of a series delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debt Security of such series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Debt Security. 11
SECTION 2.04. Execution and Authentication. The Debt Securities shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. Signatures may be in the form of a manual or facsimile signature. The Company may use the facsimile signature of any Person who shall have been a President or Vice President thereof, or of any Person who shall have been a Secretary or Assistant Secretary thereof, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Debt Securities shall be authenticated and delivered or disposed of such Person shall have ceased to be the President or a Vice President, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Company. The seal of the Company may be in the form of a facsimile of such seal and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Debt Securities. The Debt Securities may contain such notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. Each Debt Security shall be dated the date of its authentication by the Trustee. A Debt Security shall not be valid until authenticated manually by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, or by an Authenticating Agent. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Debt Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Debt Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of such Debt Securities, signed by its President or any Vice President and its Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order shall authenticate and deliver such Debt Securities. In authenticating such Debt Securities and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Debt Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the form and terms thereof have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Debt Securities if the issue of such Debt Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Debt Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonable acceptable to the Trustee. SECTION 2.05. Registration of Transfer and Exchange. (a) Debt Securities of any series may be exchanged upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, for other Debt Securities of such series of authorized denominations, and for a like aggregate principal amount, upon payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, all as provided in this Section. In respect of any Debt Securities so surrendered for exchange, 12
the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange therefor the Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series that the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding. (b) The Company shall keep, or cause to be kept, at its office or agency designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, or such other location designated by the Company a register or registers (herein referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register the Debt Securities and the transfers of Debt Securities as in this Article provided and which at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. The registrar for the purpose of registering Debt Securities and transfer of Debt Securities as herein provided shall be appointed as authorized by Board Resolution (the "Security Registrar"). Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Debt Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series as the Debt Security presented for a like aggregate principal amount. All Debt Securities presented or surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, as provided in this Section, shall be accompanied (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security Registrar, duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder's duly authorized attorney in writing. (c) No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Debt Securities, or issue of new Debt Securities in case of partial redemption of any series, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 3.03(b) and Section 9.04 not involving any transfer. (d) The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Debt Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the Outstanding Debt Securities of the same series and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, nor (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Debt Securities of any series or portions thereof called for redemption. The provisions of this Section 2.05 are, with respect to any Global Security, subject to Section 2.11 hereof. SECTION 2.06. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Debt Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Debt Securities (printed, lithographed or typewritten) 13
of any authorized denomination. Such temporary Debt Securities shall be substantially in the form of the definitive Debt Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Debt Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every temporary Debt Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Debt Securities of such series. Without unnecessary delay the Company will execute and will furnish definitive Debt Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Debt Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor (without charge to the holders), at the office or agency of the Company designated for the purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange for such temporary Debt Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Debt Securities of such series, unless the Company advises the Trustee to the effect that definitive Debt Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged, the temporary Debt Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debt Securities of such series authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 2.07. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Debt Securities. In case any temporary or definitive Debt Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall execute, and upon the Company's request the Trustee (subject as aforesaid) shall authenticate and deliver, a new Debt Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Debt Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Debt Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Debt Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant's Debt Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Debt Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debt Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Debt Security that has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Debt Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Debt Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Debt Security and of the ownership thereof. 14
Every replacement Debt Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Debt Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Debt Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debt Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender. SECTION 2.08. Cancellation. All Debt Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer shall, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it, and no Debt Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On written request of the Company at the time of such surrender, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Debt Securities held by the Trustee. In the absence of such request the Trustee may dispose of canceled Debt Securities in accordance with its standard procedures and the Trustee shall maintain a written record of such disposal. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Debt Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Debt Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. SECTION 2.09. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing in this Indenture or in the Debt Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the Debt Securities (and, with respect to the provisions of Article XIV, the holders of Senior Indebtedness) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained; all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Debt Securities (and, with respect to the provisions of Article XIV, the holders of Senior Indebtedness). SECTION 2.10. Authenticating Agent. So long as any of the Debt Securities of any series remain Outstanding, there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Debt Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Debt Securities of such series issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Debt Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Debt Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company 15
and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions, it shall resign immediately. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time (and upon request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto. The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Debt Securities under this Section if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustee, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing holders of Debt Securities. SECTION 2.11. Global Securities. (a) If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Debt Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security or Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security that (i) shall represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the Outstanding Debt Securities of such series, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11 of the Indenture, this Debt Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or to a nominee of such successor Depositary." (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security or Securities of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depositary for such series, or to a successor Depositary for such series selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary. (c) If at any time the Depositary for a series of the Debt Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series or if at any time the Depositary for such 16
series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Debt Securities of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Debt Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Debt Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security or Securities and that the provisions of this Section 2.11 shall no longer apply to the Debt Securities of such series. In such event, the Company will execute and subject to Section 2.05, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Debt Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. Upon the exchange of the Global Security or Securities for such Debt Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security or Securities shall be canceled by the Trustee. Such Debt Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security or Securities pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Debt Securities to the Depositary for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Debt Securities are so registered. 17
ARTICLE III REDEMPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND SINKING FUND PROVISIONS SECTION 3.01. Redemption. The Company may redeem the Debt Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof. SECTION 3.02. Notice of Redemption. (a) In case the Company shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Debt Securities of any series in accordance with the right reserved so to do, the Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Debt Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register unless a shorter period is specified in the Debt Securities to be redeemed. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Debt Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debt Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Debt Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Debt Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction. Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Debt Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that payment of the redemption price of such Debt Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, the City and State of New York, upon presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue and that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case. If less than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Debt Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Debt Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Debt Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Debt Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Debt Security, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued. (b) If less than all the Debt Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days' notice in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities of the series to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it 18
shall deem appropriate and fair in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such Debt Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000, the Debt Securities to be redeemed and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Debt Securities to be redeemed, in whole or in part. The Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by its President or any Vice President, instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Debt Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section. SECTION 3.03. Payment Upon Redemption. (a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption and interest on such Debt Securities or portions of Debt Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Debt Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Debt Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, said Debt Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (but if the date fixed for redemption is an interest payment date, the interest installment payable on such date shall be payable to the registered holder at the close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03). (b) Upon presentation of any Debt Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and the office or agency where the Debt Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Debt Security so presented. SECTION 3.04. Sinking Fund. The provisions of Sections 3.04, 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Debt Securities of a 19
series, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.01 for Debt Securities of such series. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Debt Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05.

by such trust, for so long as such Trust Securities remain outstanding, the Company will (i) maintain 100% direct or indirect ownership of the Common Securities of such trust; provided, however, that any permitted successor of the Company under the Indenture may succeed to the Company's ownership of the Common Securities, (ii) not cause, as sponsor of such trust, or permit, as holder of Common Securities of such trust, the dissolution, winding- up or termination of such trust, except in connection with a distribution of Debt Securities as provided in the Declaration and in connection with certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations permitted by the Declaration and (iii) use its reasonable efforts to cause such trust (a) to remain a business trust, except in connection with a distribution of Debt Securities, the redemption of all of the Trust Securities of such Capital Trust or certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations, each as permitted by the Declaration of such Capital Trust, and (b) to otherwise continue to be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust/fixed investment trust.

the distribution of Debt Securities to holders of Trust Securities in liquidation of their interests in such trust, (ii) the redemption of all outstanding Trust Securities of such trust, and (iii) mergers, consolidations or amalgamations, each as permitted by the Declaration of such trust. (7) the Company fails to observe or perform any other of its covenants or agreements with respect to that series contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to that series of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof (other than a covenant or agreement that has been expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Debt Securities other than such series) for a period of 60 days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder, shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee, by registered or certified mail, or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders of (i) at least 10% in principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series at the time Outstanding or (ii) at least 10% in stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of the Capital Trust, if any, corresponding to such series; (b) If an Event of Default described in clause 1, 2, 3 or 6 of this Section 6.01 with respect to Debt Securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, unless the principal of all the Debt Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee, if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal of all the Debt Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or in the Debt Securities of that series or established with respect to that series pursuant to Section 2.01 to the contrary. If an Event of Default specified in clause (4) or (5) of this Section 6.01 occurs or is continuing, then the principal amount of all the Debt Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder.

annum expressed in the Debt Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Debt Securities of that series that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06. No such rescission and annulment of a declaration shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. (d) If a Covenant Event of Default with respect to Debt Securities of any series at the time outstanding occurs and is continuing, any Holder of Debt Securities of such series may commence an action against the Company for breach of such covenant or covenants giving rise thereto, and the holders of (i) not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series then Outstanding; or (ii) not less than 10% in aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities, if any, corresponding to such series of Debt Securities, may direct the Trustee to commence an action against the Company for breach of such covenant or covenants giving rise thereto. (e) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Debt Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment of a declaration or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken. SECTION 6.02. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. (a) The Company covenants that (1) in case it shall default in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Debt Securities of a series, or any payment required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to that series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 90 days, or (2) in case it shall default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Debt Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Debt Securities of a series or upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Debt Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all such Debt Securities for principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or both, as the case may be, with interest upon the overdue principal (and premium, if any) and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law and, if the Debt Securities are held by a Capital Trust, without duplication of any other amounts paid by such trust in respect thereof) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum 29
expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06. (b) If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other obligor upon the Debt Securities of that series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or other obligor upon the Debt Securities of that series, wherever situated. (c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceedings affecting the Company or its creditors or property, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and shall (except as may be otherwise provided by law) be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Debt Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company under the Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount that may become due and payable by the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same after the deduction of the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Debt Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06. (d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Debt Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Debt Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Debt Securities of such series. In case of an Event of Default hereunder, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in aid of 30
the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Debt Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding. SECTION 6.03. Application of Moneys Collected. Any moneys collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article with respect to a particular series of Debt Securities shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such moneys on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest, upon presentation of the Debt Securities of that series, and notation thereon of the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses of collection and of all amounts payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06; SECOND: To the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company if and to the extent required by Article XIV; and THIRD: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Debt Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Debt Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, respectively. SECTION 6.04. Limitation on Suits. No holder of any Debt Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the Debt Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default, as hereinbefore provided; (ii) the holders of not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; and (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and (v) during such 60-day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request. 31
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Debt Security to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Debt Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Debt Security (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder, and by accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Debt Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Debt Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Debt Securities of series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6.04, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity. SECTION 6.05. ...Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission not Waiver. (a) Except as otherwise provided in the final sentence of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article to the Trustee or to the Securityholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Debt Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Debt Securities. (b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Debt Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.

Section 8.04. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of (i) a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby or (ii) if the Debt Securities of a series are issued to a Capital Trust, holders of a majority in aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such Capital Trust then outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, may on behalf of the holders of all of the Debt Securities of such series waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained herein or established pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such series and its consequences, except (i) a default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Debt Securities of that series as and when the same shall become due by the terms of such Debt Securities otherwise than by acceleration (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal and any premium has been deposited with the Trustee (in accordance with Section 6.01(c)), (ii) a default in the covenants contained in Section 4.06 or (iii) in respect of a default or violation of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article IX or the provisions of any indenture supplemental hereto cannot be amended or modified without the consent of the holders of each Outstanding Debt Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Debt Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 6.07. Undertaking to Pay Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Debt Securities by such holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 6.07 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series (or, with respect to any series of Debt Securities issued to a Capital Trust, the holder or group of holders of more than 10% in aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such Capital Trust), or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder (or, with respect to any series of Debt Securities issued to a Capital Trust, the holder of a Preferred Security of such Capital Trust) for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Debt Security or established pursuant to this Indenture. 33
SECTION 6.08. Notice of Defaults. The Company shall provide written notice to the Trustee immediately upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default hereunder, and if any such Default or Event of Default affects the Outstanding Debt Securities of any series of Debt Securities issued to a Capital Trust or a trustee of such trust, the Company shall immediately provide a copy of such written notice to the Property Trustee of such Capital Trust. Within 30 days of the Trustee obtaining actual knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the Trustee will transmit notice of such Default or Event of Default to the holders of the Debt Securities, unless such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived. 34
ARTICLE VII CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE SECTION 7.01. Certain Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee. (a) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of a series and after the curing of all Events of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of that series that may have occurred, shall undertake to perform with respect to the Debt Securities of such series such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of a series has occurred (that has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to Debt Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. (b) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (1) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities of a series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to that series that may have occurred: (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall with respect to the Debt Securities of such series be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to the Debt Securities of such series except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may with respect to the Debt Securities of such series conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirement of this Indenture; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; 35
(3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee under this Indenture with respect to the Debt Securities of that series; and (4) None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Indenture or adequate indemnity against such risk is not reasonably assured to it. SECTION 7.02. Certain Rights of Trustee. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01: (a) The Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) Any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution or an instrument signed in the name of the Company by the President, or any Vice President and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer thereof (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed herein); (c) The Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (d) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred therein or thereby; nothing contained herein shall, however, relieve the Trustee of the obligation, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to a series of the Debt Securities (that has not been cured or waived) to exercise with respect to Debt Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs; 36
(e) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; (f) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond, security, or other papers or documents, unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of the particular series affected thereby (determined as provided in Section 8.04); provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such costs, expenses or liabilities as a condition to so proceeding. The reasonable expense of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand; (g) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (h) Whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (i) The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it; and (j) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of any Event of Default or defaults with respect to any series of Debt Securities issued hereunder unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge thereof, unless notice of the Event of Default or default is provided in writing by the Company to the Trustee or unless the holders of not less than (x) twenty-five percent, in the case of an Acceleration Event of Default, and (y) ten percent, in the case of a Covenant Event of Default, of the outstanding Debt Securities of such series give notice of such Event of Default or default to the Trustee. (k) The permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties. 37
SECTION 7.03. Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Debt Securities. (a) The recitals contained herein and in the Debt Securities shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. (b) The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Debt Securities. (c) The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of any of the Debt Securities or of the proceeds of such Debt Securities, or for the use or application of any moneys paid over by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture or established pursuant to Section 2.01, or for the use or application of any moneys received by any paying agent other than the Trustee. SECTION 7.04. May Hold Debt Securities. The Trustee or any paying agent or Security Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Debt Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, paying agent or Security Registrar. SECTION 7.05. Moneys Held in Trust. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.06, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder except such as it may agree with the Company to pay thereon. SECTION 7.06. Compensation and Reimbursement. (a) The Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such reasonable compensation (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust), as the Company and the Trustee may from time to time agree in writing, for all services rendered by it in the execution of the trusts hereby created and in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder of the Trustee, and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all Persons not regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its negligence or bad faith. The Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee (and its officers, agents, directors and employees) for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim of liability in the premises. (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, 38
disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Such additional indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Debt Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Debt Securities. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) or any other similar law for the relief of debtors. SECTION 7.07. Reliance on Officers' Certificate. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof. SECTION 7.08. Qualification; Conflicting Interests. If the Trustee has or shall acquire any "conflicting interest" within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee and the Company shall in all respects comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. SECTION 7.09. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities issued hereunder which shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or any State or Territory thereof or of the District of Columbia, or a corporation or other Person permitted to act as trustee by the Commission, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least fifty million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000), and subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State, Territorial or District of Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Company may not, nor may any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company, serve as Trustee. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 7.10. 39
SECTION 7.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. (a) The Trustee or any successor hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company, and, if the Debt Securities of such series are held by a Capital Trust, to the property trustee of such Capital Trust, and by transmitting notice of resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of such series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee with respect to Debt Securities of such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may, at the expense of the Company, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to Debt Securities of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Debt Security or Debt Securities for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee. (b) In case at any time any one of the following shall occur: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 7.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Debt Security or Debt Securities for at least six months; or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all Debt Securities and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 6.08, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided herein, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Debt Security or Debt Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of that holder and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor 40
trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee. (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to such series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company and may appoint a successor Trustee for such series with the consent of the Company. (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of a series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 7.11. (e) Any successor trustee appointed pursuant to this Section may be appointed with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series or all of such series, and at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of any particular series. SECTION 7.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to all Debt Securities, every such successor trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights, powers, and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates, (2) shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such 41
Trustees co-trustees of the same trust, that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee and that no Trustee shall be responsible for any act or failure to act on the part of any other Trustee hereunder; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein, such retiring Trustee shall with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates have no further responsibility for the exercise of rights and powers or for the performance of the duties and obligations vested in the Trustee under this Indenture, and each such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor trustee, to the extent contemplated by such supplemental indenture, the property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Debt Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be. (d) No successor trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. (e) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section, the Company shall transmit notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. If the Company fails to transmit such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be transmitted at the expense of the Company. SECTION 7.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 7.08 and eligible under the provisions of Section 7.09, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In case any Debt Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication 42
and deliver the Debt Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Debt Securities. SECTION 7.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company. The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, excluding any creditor relationship described in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act to the extent included therein. 43
ARTICLE VIII CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS SECTION 8.01. Evidence of Action by Securityholders. Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Debt Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing. If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officers' Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Debt Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however, that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date. SECTION 8.02. Proof of Execution by Securityholders. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Debt Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner: (a) The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee. (b) The ownership of Debt Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Debt Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof. (c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary. 44
SECTION 8.03. Who May be Deemed Owners. Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Debt Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Debt Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Debt Security (whether or not such Debt Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Debt Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. SECTION 8.04. Certain Debt Securities Owned by Company Disregarded. In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent waiver under this Indenture, the Debt Securities of that series that are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any other obligor on the Debt Securities of that series or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on the Debt Securities of that series shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Debt Securities of such series that the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Debt Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Debt Securities and that the pledgee is not a Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. SECTION 8.05. Actions Binding on Future Securityholders. At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of a particular series in connection with such action, any holder of a Debt Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Debt Securities the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke such action so far as concerns such Debt Security. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Debt Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Debt Security, and of any Debt Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Debt Security. Any action taken by the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of a particular 45
series in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Debt Securities of that series. 46
ARTICLE IX SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES SECTION 9.01. Supplemental Indentures Without the Consent of Securityholders. In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Company and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect), without the consent of the Securityholders, for one or more of the following purposes: (a) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency herein or in the Debt Securities of any series; (b) to comply with Section 10.01 and Section 10.03; (c) to provide for uncertificated Debt Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Debt Securities; (d) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of Debt Securities (and if such covenants are to be for the benefit of less than all series of Debt Securities, stating that such covenants are expressly being included solely for the benefit of such series) or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company; (e) to add to, delete from, or revise the conditions, limitations and restrictions on the authorized amount, terms or purposes of issue, authentication and delivery of Debt Securities, as herein set forth; (f) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder in any material respect; or (g) to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of the Debt Securities of any series as provided in Section 2.01, to establish the form of any certifications required to be furnished pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or any series of Debt Securities, or to add to the rights of the holders of any series of Debt Securities. The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of 47
any of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 9.02. SECTION 9.02. Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Securityholders. With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.01) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures at the time Outstanding, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner not covered by Section 9.01 the rights of the holders of the Debt Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holders of each Debt Security then Outstanding and affected thereby, (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Debt Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Debt Security so affected or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debt Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders of any series affected thereby under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. SECTION 9.03. Effect of Supplemental Indentures. Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Section 10.01, this Indenture shall, with respect to such series, be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of Debt Securities of the series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes. SECTION 9.04. Debt Securities Affected by Supplemental Indentures. Debt Securities of any series affected by a supplemental indenture, authenticated and delivered after the execution of such supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Section 10.01, may bear a notation in form approved by the Company, provided such form meets the requirements of any exchange upon which such series may be listed, as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Debt Securities of that series so modified as to conform, in the 48
opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any, such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Company, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Debt Securities of that series then outstanding.

Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Securityholders required to consent thereto as aforesaid, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental indenture. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, shall receive, in addition to the documents required by Section 13.07, an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by, and conforms to, the terms of this Article and that it is proper for the Trustee under the provisions of this Article to join in the execution thereof. Promptly after the execution by the Company and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid, a notice, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture, to the Securityholders of all series affected thereby as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Any failure of the Trustee to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture. 49
ARTICLE X SUCCESSOR CORPORATION SECTION 10.01. Company may Consolidate, Reincorporate, Etc. on Certain Conditions. The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge into, or sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of its assets to, or reincorporate or otherwise reorganize as, another entity, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, unless: (i) the successor or transferee entity is a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; (ii) the successor or transferee corporation shall expressly assume, by an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on all the Debt Securities and the performance or observance of every covenant and obligation of this Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or observed; (iii) the Company or the successor corporation, as the case may be, will not, immediately after giving effect to such transaction, be in default in the performance of any covenant or condition hereunder; (iv) if any series of Debt Securities, of which any Debt Securities are then Outstanding, has been issued to a Capital Trust, such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance, or reincorporation or reorganization is permitted under the Declaration of such Capital Trust, and Preferred Securities Guarantee with respect to the Preferred Securities issued thereby, and does not give rise to any breach or violation of such Declaration or Preferred Securities Guarantee; and (v) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance, or reincorporation or reorganization and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with this Article and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with. SECTION 10.02. Successor Corporation Substituted. Upon any consolidation of the Company with, merger of the Company into, or reincorporation or other reorganization of the Company as, any other Person or any conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets of the Company substantially as an entirety in accordance with Section 10.01, the successor Person formed by such consolidation, into which the Company is merged or reincorporated or reorganized, or to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Company herein, and thereafter, 50
except in the case of a lease, the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and the Debt Securities. SECTION 10.03. Obligations in the Event of Non-U.S. Merger. (a) If, upon or after the occurrence of a "Non-U.S. Merger," the Company or any Capital Trust is required to withhold, or any holder of Debt Securities or Trust Securities is required to pay, any present or future amount in respect of taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges on any payment made in respect of principal of or interest or premium on that holder's Debt Securities or Trust Securities by any taxing authority that would not have been withheld or imposed on that payment had the Non-U.S. Merger not occurred, the Company will pay to that holder an amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") equal to all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every net payment of principal, interest and premium to the holder will not be less than the amount provided for in the Debt Securities or Preferred Securities. The term "net payment" means the amount the Company will pay to the holder after the Company's or that holder's payment, deduction or withholding an amount for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed with respect to that payment by any taxing authority that would not have been imposed if the Non-U.S. Merger had not occurred. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, to the extent that any withholding or imposition of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge is assessed on different taxpayers at different rates, the rate applicable to each holder of Debt Securities or Preferred Securities will be the highest marginal rate for the period in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made. Any reference in the Indenture, or the Debt Securities to principal, interest, premium or any other amount payable in respect of the Debt Securities also refers to any Gross-Up Payment payable with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 10.03. (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Non-U.S. Merger, the successor Company will enter into an indenture supplemental hereto, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, pursuant to which the successor Company will: (i) irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or Federal court sitting in The City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Indenture or any Debt Security; (ii) waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in any inconvenient forum; (iii) agree that final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding upon the successor Company and may be enforced in the courts of the jurisdiction of which the successor Company is subject by a suit upon such judgment, provided that service of process is effected upon 51
the successor Company in the manner specified in the following paragraph or as otherwise permitted by law; provided, however, that such covenant will not constitute a waiver of any right to appeal any such judgment, to seek any stay or otherwise to seek reconsideration or review of any such judgment or any stay of execution or levy pending an appeal from, or a suit, action or proceeding for reconsideration or review of, any such judgment; (iv) covenant that, as long as any of the Debt Securities remain Outstanding, it will at all times have an authorized agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York upon whom process may be served in any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture or any Debt Security on which service of process shall to the extent permitted by law be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Company in any such legal action or proceeding (which authorized agent may be CT Corporation System or its successor); and (v) consent to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in the preceding clauses by service upon its designated agent. 52

"10-year Treasury CMT" means the rate determined in accordance with the following provisions: (1) With respect to any Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date and the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period that begins immediately thereafter, the 10-year Treasury CMT means the rate per annum for deposits for a 10-year period commencing on the Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date (displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page currently found on page "H15T10Y Index") most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 containing the caption "Daily Treasury Constant Maturities from STAT USA", and the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index and the row for the relevant Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date. (2) If such rate is no longer displayed on the page described in (1) above, or is not so displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index as is published in H.15(519). (3) If such rate is no longer displayed on the page described in (2) above, or if not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date will be such constant maturity treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States -11-
Treasury rate for the Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date as may then be published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page most nearly corresponding to Telerate Page 7051 and published in H.15(519). (4) If the information described in (3) above is not provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date, then the 10-year Treasury CMT for such Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date reported, according to their written records, by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Company (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations of the United States ("Treasury Debt Securities") with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. (5) If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Debt Securities quotations as described in (4) above, the 10-year Treasury CMT for the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date of three Reference Dealers in New York, New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Debt Securities with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a -12-
remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. (6) If three or four (and not five) of such Reference Dealers are quoting as set forth above, then the 10-year Treasury CMT will be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however, that if fewer than three Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as set forth above, the 10-year Treasury CMT with respect to the applicable Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date will remain the 10-year Treasury CMT for the immediately preceding Quarterly Interest Accrual Period. If two Treasury Debt Securities with an original maturity as described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, then the quotes for the Treasury Debt Securities with the shorter remaining term to maturity will be used. "30-year Treasury CMT" has the meaning specified under the definition of 10-year Treasury CMT, except that (i) each reference to "10-year" in the definition of the "10-year Treasury CMT" will be "30-year" for the purposes of the "30-year Treasury CMT", (ii) the Designated CMT Maturity Index for the 30-year Treasury CMT shall be 30 years, and (iii) the parenthetical phrase in clause (1) of such definition shall be replaced with "(the sum of the rate displayed on the Bloomberg interest rate page currently found on page "H15T20Y Index" and the extrapolation factor found on page "H15FACT")". "3-Month LIBOR Rate" means, with respect to any Quarterly Interest Accrual Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date for that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period. If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 3750, 3-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time on the Quarterly Interest Rate Determination Date for that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if -13-
necessary to the nearest hundredth of 1%, or 0.0001) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest hundredth of 1%, or 0.0001) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent, at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a 3-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, 3-Month LIBOR for that Quarterly Interest Accrual Period will be the same as 3-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Quarterly Interest Accrual Period. The establishment of 3-Month LIBOR for each Quarterly Interest Accrual Period by the Trustee shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding. "Total Debt" means the sum of (i) short-term borrowing, (ii) current maturities of long-term debt, and (iii) long term debt, including the Debt Securities; provided, however, that if because of a change in GAAP that results in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle applicable to the Company's financial reporting or a restatement of the Company's historical financial statements, the Company's Total Debt is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change, then, commencing with the fiscal quarter for which such changes in GAAP become effective, Total Debt will be calculated on a pro forma basis as if such change had not occurred. "Treasury Rate" means: (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the week immediately prior to the date of calculation, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15(519) or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Remaining Life of Fixed Rate Period (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of Fixed Rate Period, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Remaining Life of Fixed Rate Period will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from these yields on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for the redemption date, -14-
in either case calculated on the third Business Day prior to the designated redemption date. "Trigger Determination Date" means, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, the 30th day prior to such interest payment date. "Trust" shall have the meaning set forth in the recitals of this Supplemental Indenture. "Trust Securities" means the Common Securities and the Preferred Securities.

There is hereby authorized a series of Debt Securities designated the "5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debt Securities due 2045," limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,100,000, which amount shall be as set forth in any written order of the Company for the authentication and delivery of Debt Securities pursuant to Section 2.04 of the Indenture. Section 2.2 Maturity. The Maturity Date will be December 1, 2045. Section 2.3 Form and Payment. Except as provided in Section 2.4, the Debt Securities shall be issued in fully registered certificated form without interest coupons. Principal of and interest (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest, if any) and premium, if any, on the Debt Securities issued in certificated form will be payable, the transfer of such Debt Securities will be registrable and such Debt Securities will be exchangeable for Debt Securities bearing identical terms and provisions at the office or agency of the Trustee in New York, New York, provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register, except in the case of Debt Securities represented by a Global Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the registered holder of any Debt Securities is the Property Trustee, the payment of the principal of and interest (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest, if any) and premium, if any, on such Debt Securities held by the Property Trustee will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Property Trustee. Section 2.4 Global Debt Security. In connection with a Dissolution Event: (a) the Debt Securities in certificated form may be presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee in exchange for a Global Security in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities so presented, to be registered in the name of the Depositary, or its nominee, and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions of the Administrative Trustees. The Company, upon any such presentation, shall execute a Global Security in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture. Payments on the Debt Securities issued as a Global Security will be made to the Depositary; and (b) if any Preferred Securities are held in non book-entry certificated form, the Debt Securities in certificated form may be presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee and any Preferred Security Certificate which represents Preferred -16-
Securities other than Preferred Securities held by the Clearing Agency or its nominee ("Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities") will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in Debt Securities presented to the Trustee by the Property Trustee having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities until such Preferred Security Certificates are presented to the Security Registrar for transfer or reissuance at which time such Preferred Security Certificates will be cancelled and a Debt Security, registered in the name of the holder of the Preferred Security Certificate or the transferee of the holder of such Preferred Security Certificate, as the case may be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Security Certificate cancelled, will be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture. On issue of such Debt Securities, Debt Securities with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Property Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been cancelled. Section 2.5 Interest. (a) (i) Interest during the Fixed Rate Period. From the original date of issuance through and including the final day of the Fixed Rate Period, each Debt Security will bear interest at the per annum rate of 5.902% (the "Fixed Rate") until the commencement of the Floating Rate Period or, if earlier, until the principal thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually, payable (subject to the provisions of Article IV) semi-annually in arrears on June 1, and December 1, of each year, commencing on June 1, 2006. (ii) Interest during the Floating Rate Period. During the Floating Rate Period, each Outstanding Debt Security will bear interest during each Quarterly Interest Accrual Period, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing March 1, 2011, at a rate equal to the lower of (i) 1.40% plus the highest of the (x) 3-Month LIBOR Rate; (y) 10-Year Treasury CMT, and (z) 30-Year Treasury CMT, as applicable for such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period and (ii) 13.25% (such rate the "Floating Rate" with respect to such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period) until the principal thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Floating Rate prevailing from time to time, compounded quarterly at such prevailing Floating Rates. (b) Payment of Interest to Record Holders of the Debt Securities. Interest on each Debt Security shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Debt Security or any predecessor Debt Security is registered, at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment, which, in respect of (i) Debt Securities of which the Property Trustee is the registered holder and the Preferred -17-
Securities are in book-entry only form or (ii) a Global Security, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if (i) the Debt Securities are held by the Property Trustee and the Preferred Securities are no longer in book-entry only form or (ii) the Debt Securities are not represented by a Global Security, the Company may select a regular record date at least one but not more than 60 Business Days before an Interest Payment Date. (c) During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable on any interest payment date will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and the amount of interest payable for any period shorter or longer than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such 180-day semi-annual period. During the Floating Rate Period, the amount of interest payable will be computed by multiplying the annual Floating Rate in effect for the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period or portion thereof in respect of which the interest payment is made by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period (or a portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 365, and multiplying the product obtained thereby by the principal amount of the Debt Securities. (d) Otherwise than in connection with the maturity or early redemption of the Debt Securities or the payment in whole or in part of deferred or overdue interest on the Debt Securities, interest on the Debt Securities may be paid only on a Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period and on a Quarterly Interest Payment Date during the Floating Rate Period. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the event that any Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such Interest Payment Date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and, in the case of a Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). (e) The Company may, at its option and in accordance with Section 4.03 of the Indenture, appoint a paying agent for the Debt Securities. If a paying agent has been appointed by the Company, the paying agent, unless the Company shall otherwise determine and so notify the paying agent, shall calculate the amount of interest payable on the Debt Securities on each Interest Payment Date. All certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions relating to the payment and calculation of interest on the Debt Securities, by the paying agent, will (in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error) be binding on the Trust, the Company, the Trustee and all holders of the Debt Securities, and no liability will (in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error) attach to the paying agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their powers, duties and discretion. (f) If a Tax Event has occurred and is continuing at any time while the Property Trustee is the holder of any Debt Securities, and the Trust or the Property Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any -18-
other taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Debt Securities held by the Property Trustee, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by the Trust and the Property Trustee after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts the Trust and the Property Trustee would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed as a result of such Tax Event. For purposes of this Section 2.5(f), a Tax Event will have occurred irrespective of whether the Company or the Trust has received an opinion of counsel. (g) To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest not paid when due hereunder, including, without limitation, all Deferred Interest, will until paid compound semi-annually at the Fixed Rate on each Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period ("Fixed Rate Compounded Interest") and compound quarterly at the prevailing Floating Rates on each Interest Payment Date during the Floating Rate Period ("Floating Rate Compounded Interest"). References to "interest" in the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture include references to such Compounded Interest. (h) In the event of the occurrence of a Registration Default under Section 8 of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company shall pay Registration Default Damages in the form of additional interest on the Debt Securities at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the principal amount of the Debt Securities to which such Registration Default applies for so long as such Registration Default continues. References to "interest" and "deferred interest" in the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture include references to Registration Default Damages. -19-
ARTICLE III REDEMPTION OF THE NOTES Section 3.1 Optional Redemption. Subject to the provisions of Article III of the Indenture, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debt Securities for cash: (i) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to December 1, 2010, at a redemption price (the "Make Whole Redemption Price") equal to the greater of: (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Debt Securities being redeemed, and (b) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon for the Remaining Life of Fixed Rate Period of the Debt Securities, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 0.25%, plus, in each case, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the redemption date; and (ii) in whole or in part in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time on or after December 1, 2010 at a redemption price (the "Optional Redemption Price") equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities to be redeemed, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the redemption date. Section 3.2 Special Event Redemption. If a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debt Securities, in whole, but not in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event at a redemption price (the "Special Redemption Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Debt Securities being redeemed, and. (ii) as determined by the Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon for the Remaining Life of Fixed Rate Period of the Debt Securities, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 0.50%, -20-
plus, in each case, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but not including the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company can, or can cause the Trust, to eliminate a Special Event by either the Company or the Trust, or both of them together, taking some ministerial action, including, but not limited to making a filing or an election, or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure which has no adverse effect on the Trust, the Company or the holders of the Trust Securities, the Company may not redeem the Debt Securities pursuant to this Section 3.2 on account of such Special Event. Section 3.3 Certain Redemption Procedures. Any redemption pursuant to this Article III will be made upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice to the registered holder of the Debt Securities. If the Debt Securities are to be redeemed in part pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 3.1, the Debt Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; provided, that if at the time of redemption, the Debt Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Debt Securities beneficially held by each holder of a Debt Security be redeemed. The Make Whole Redemption Price, Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price, as applicable, shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such redemption or at such earlier time as the Company determines and specifies in the notice of redemption, provided the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the such redemption price by 10:00 a.m. on the date such redemption price is to be paid. Section 3.4 No Sinking Fund. The Debt Securities are not entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. -21-
ARTICLE IV OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY DEFERRAL OF INTEREST Section 4.1 Optional Interest Deferral. So long as no Acceleration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Debt Securities, to elect to defer payment of interest on the Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date, provided that no such deferral may extend beyond the maturity date of, or redemption date for, the Debt Securities ("Optional Deferral"). A period of Optional Deferral (an "Optional Deferral Period") will be deemed to have commenced on the first Interest Payment Date on which interest is deferred due to such Optional Deferral and end on the first date thereafter on which all Deferred Interest in respect thereof is paid in full. The Company may not elect Optional Deferral for an Interest Payment Date, if the Optional Deferral Period ending on such Interest Payment Date, together with all consecutive Optional Deferral Periods and Mandatory Deferral Periods, or combination thereof preceding such elected Optional Deferral Period, with respect to which any Deferred Interest remains outstanding, would exceed ten years. Interest on the Debt Securities will continue to accrue and compound during an Optional Deferral Period. Upon the termination of an Optional Deferral Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest, Registration Default Damages, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments then due, the Company may select a new period of Optional Deferral, subject to the foregoing requirements of this Section 4.1. No interest shall be due and payable during an Optional Deferral Period commenced and continued in accordance with this Section 4.1, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Optional Deferral Period, subject to the terms of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of Optional Deferral pursuant to this Section 4.1, will bear interest at the Fixed Rate compounded semi-annually during each semi-annual accrual period during the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly at the prevailing Floating Rates during each quarterly interest accrual period during the Floating Rate Period. At the end of the Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on the Debt Securities, including any Compounded Interest, Additional Interest, Registration Default Damages and Gross-Up Payments (together, "Optional Deferred Interest") which shall be payable to the holders of the Debt Securities in whose names the Debt Securities are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of the Optional Deferral Period. Section 4.2 Mandatory Interest Deferral. Subject to the following sentence, the Company shall not pay interest on the Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date in an amount in excess of the New Common Equity Amount if a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event has occurred on the Trigger Determination Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event, the Company shall pay all interest due and payable on the Debt -22-
Securities (i) on the maturity or earlier redemption thereof, and (ii) on the first Interest Payment Date to occur following deferral of interest on the Debt Securities due to Mandatory Deferral, Optional Deferral, or any combination thereof, that has continued without payment in full of all deferred interest for consecutive semi-annual and/or quarterly interest accrual periods aggregating to in excess of ten years. Deferral of interest on the Debt Securities required under the terms of this Section 4.2 is referred to as "Mandatory Deferral." A period of Mandatory Deferral (a "Mandatory Deferral Period") will be deemed to commence on the first Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest payments are deferred due to Mandatory Deferral and end on the first date thereafter on which all Deferred Interest in respect thereof is paid in full. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of Mandatory Deferral pursuant to this Section 4.2, will bear interest at the Fixed Rate compounded semi-annually during each semi-annual accrual period during the Fixed Rate Period and at the prevailing Floating Rates compounded quarterly during each quarterly interest accrual period during the Floating Rate Period. At the end of the Mandatory Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on the Debt Securities, including any Compounded Interest, Additional Interest, Registration Default Damages and Gross-Up Payments (together, "Mandatory Deferred Interest") which shall be payable to the holders of the Debt Securities in whose names the Debt Securities are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of the Mandatory Deferral Period. No interest shall be due and payable during a period of Mandatory Deferral, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during a Mandatory Deferral Period, subject to the terms of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Section 4.3 Notice of Deferrals. (a)(i) The Company shall give notice of any election of an Optional Deferral not fewer than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Interest Payment Date for which interest on the Debt Securities will be deferred. The notice of election of Optional Deferral, once given, will be irrevocable and the deferral of interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date will be considered an Optional Deferral for all purposes under the Indenture notwithstanding the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event on the Trigger Determination Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date if such notice is provided prior to such Trigger Determination Date. (ii) If a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event has occurred as of any Trigger Determination Date, the Company shall give notice thereof not less than 15 days prior to the related Interest Payment Date. If a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event has occurred as of any Trigger Determination Date prior to the Company's providing of a notice of election of Optional Deferral with respect to the applicable Interest Payment Date, the Company's subsequent delivery of a notice of election of Optional Deferral shall be without effect with respect to the relevant Interest Payment Date. -23-
(b) If the Property Trustee is the only registered holder of the Debt Securities at the time the Company provides notice of its election of Optional Deferral or of the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event, the Company shall give its written notice to the Administrative Trustees, the Property Trustee and the Trustee. If the Property Trustee is not the only holder of the Debt Securities at the time the Company provides notice of its election of Optional Deferral or of the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event, the Company shall give its written notice to the holders of the Debt Securities and the Trustee. -24-
ARTICLE V CERTAIN COVENANTS Section 5.1 Limitation on Payment of Current Interest when Deferred Interest is Outstanding. The Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Debt Security during the Semi-Annual Interest Accrual Period or Quarterly Interest Accrual Period, as applicable, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on such Debt Security. Section 5.2 Limitation on Source of Payment of Deferred Interest. The Company may not pay Deferred Interest on the Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date in an amount that exceeds the New Common Equity Amount for such Interest Payment Date. Section 5.3 Covenants not to be Construed to Limit Claims. The covenants contained in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof shall not be construed to limit the ability of the holders of the Debt Securities to recover amounts in case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceeding affecting the Company and its property. Section 5.4 Obligation to Effect Certain Common Stock Sales. (a) Commencing with the first to occur of: (i) if any Deferred Interest is outstanding due to Mandatory Deferral, the date that is one year after the first Interest Payment Date for which the Company was required to defer any payment of interest on the Debt Securities due to Mandatory Deferral (the "First Mandatory Deferral Anniversary"), and (ii) if any Deferred Interest is outstanding due to an Optional Deferral or Mandatory Deferral, or combination thereof, the date that is five years after the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company deferred payment of interest on the Debt Securities, whether because of Optional Deferral or Mandatory Deferral and for which Deferred Interest remains outstanding (the "Fifth Deferral Anniversary"), the Company shall continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect sales of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Debt Securities then outstanding; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of its common stock during a Market Disruption Event. (b) As used in this Section 5.4, the term "commercially reasonable efforts" means commercially reasonable efforts on the part of the Company to complete the sale of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, to third parties that are not subsidiaries of the Company. The Company will not be considered to have used its -25-
commercially reasonable efforts to effect a sale of stock if it determines to not pursue or complete such sale solely due to pricing considerations. (c) Following the First Mandatory Deferral Anniversary or Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company shall apply the net proceeds received by it from sales of shares of its common stock, including sales of treasury shares, to the payment of all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest, with net proceeds to be paid promptly after receipt until all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest have been paid in full. In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of shares of its common stock following such First Mandatory Deferral Anniversary or Fifth Deferral Anniversary are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of Deferred Interest, such net proceeds will be paid to the holders of the Debt Securities on a pro rata basis; provided, that if the Company has outstanding at such time any debt securities ranking pari passu with the Debt Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated to sell shares of its common stock and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest on such pari passu securities and the Company at such time is required to apply such proceeds to pay deferred interest on such pari passu securities, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of such deferred interest shall be applied to the Debt Securities and such pari passu securities on a pro rata basis. Section 5.5 Application of Payments to Deferred Interest. In the event that Deferred Interest is outstanding on the Debt Securities due to Mandatory Deferral and due to Optional Deferral, and an amount applied to the payment of deferred interest outstanding on the Debt Securities is not sufficient to repay all such deferred interest in full, such amount shall be applied on a pro rata basis to interest deferred due to Mandatory Deferral and interest deferred due to Optional Deferral. Section 5.6 Payment of Expenses. In connection with the offering, sale and issuance of the Debt Securities to the Property Trustee in connection with the sale of the Trust Securities by the Trust, the Company, in its capacity as borrower with respect to the Debt Securities, shall: (a) pay all costs and expenses relating to the offering, sale and issuance of the Debt Securities, including commissions to the initial purchasers thereof payable pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and compensation of the Trustee under the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.06 of the Indenture; (b) pay all costs and expenses of the Trust (including, but not limited to, costs and expenses relating to the organization of the Trust, the offering, sale and issuance of the Trust Securities (including commissions to the underwriters in connection therewith), the fees and expenses of the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, the costs and expenses relating to the operation of the Trust, including without limitation, costs and expenses of accountants, attorneys, statistical or bookkeeping services, expenses for printing and engraving and computing or accounting equipment, paying -26-
agent(s), registrar(s), transfer agent(s), duplicating, travel and telephone and other telecommunications expenses and costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, financing, and disposition of Trust assets); and (c) pay any and all taxes (other than United States withholding taxes attributable to the Trust or its assets) and all liabilities, costs and expenses with respect to such taxes of the Trust. Section 5.7 Payment upon Resignation or Removal. Upon termination of this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture or the removal or resignation of the Trustee, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all amounts accrued under Section 7.06 of the Indenture to the date of such termination, removal or resignation. Upon termination of the Declaration or the removal or resignation of the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 8.10 of the Declaration, the Company shall pay to the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee, as the case may be, all amounts accrued under Section 8.06 of the Declaration to the date of such termination, removal or resignation. Section 5.8 Certain Amendments, Modifications and Waivers. Section 5.4 of this Supplemental Indenture may not be amended, modified or waived without the consent of each holder of Outstanding Debt Securities, or, if any Debt Securities are held by the Trust, by each holder of the Preferred Securities outstanding, unless such amendment, modification or waiver irrevocably eliminates, or a prior amendment, modification or waiver then in effect irrevocably eliminated, the payment restriction set forth in Section 5.2 hereof. -27-
ARTICLE VI SUBORDINATION Section 6.1 Agreement to Subordinate. The Company covenants and agrees, and each holder of Debt Securities issued hereunder by such holder's acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all Debt Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article VI; and each holder of a Debt Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or assignment thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions. The payment by the Company of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all Debt Securities issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Supplemental Indenture or thereafter incurred. No provision of this Article VI shall prevent the occurrence of any default, Covenant Default or Acceleration Event of Default hereunder. Section 6.2 Default on Senior Indebtedness. In the event and during the continuation of any default by the Company in the payment of principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, or in the event that the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company has been accelerated because of a default, then, in either case, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to the principal (including redemption and sinking fund payments) of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Debt Securities. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be received by the Trustee or any holder when such payment is prohibited by the preceding paragraph of this Section 6.2, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, but only to the extent that the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on the Senior Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness. Section 6.3 Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy. Upon any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due upon all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money in accordance with its terms, before any payment is made by the -28-
Company on account of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Debt Securities; and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the holders of the Debt Securities or the Trustee would be entitled to receive from the Company, except for the provisions of this Article VI, shall be paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the holders of the Debt Securities or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders, as calculated by the Company) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made to the holders of Debt Securities or to the Trustee. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee or the holders of the Debt Securities before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. For purposes of this Article VI, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article VI with respect to the Debt Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company that may at the time be outstanding, provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to -29-
another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article X of the Indenture shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 6.3 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article X of the Indenture. Nothing in Section 6.2 or in this Section 6.3 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.06 of the Indenture. Section 6.4 Subrogation. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the rights of the holders of the Debt Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders for such Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the holders of the Debt Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article VI, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article VI, to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness by holders of the Debt Securities or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the holders of the Debt Securities be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness. It is understood that the provisions of this Article VI are and are intended solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the holders of the Debt Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of such Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article VI or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Debt Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the holders of the Debt Securities, the obligation of the Company which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the holders of the Debt Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Debt Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Debt Securities and creditors of the Company, other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the holder of any Debt Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article VI of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company, received upon the exercise of any such remedy. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article VI, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Indenture, and the holders of the Debt Securities, shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or -30-
distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the holders of the Debt Securities, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article VI. Section 6.5 Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each holder of a Debt Security by such holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on such holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article VI and appoints the Trustee such holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Section 6.6 Notice by the Company. The Company shall give prompt written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Debt Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article VI. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article VI or any other provision of the Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Debt Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article VI unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee from the Company or a holder or holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Indenture, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section 6.6 at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Debt Security), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Indenture, shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of such Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article VI, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of -31-
such Person under this Article VI, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. Section 6.7 Rights of the Trustee; Holders of Senior Indebtedness. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article VI in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article VI, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to holders of Debt Securities, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article VI or otherwise. Section 6.8 Subordination May Not Be Impaired. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of the Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the holders of the Debt Securities, without incurring responsibility to the holders of the Debt Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article VI or the obligations hereunder of the holders of the Debt Securities to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person. -32-
Section 6.9 No Right to Rely on Other Covenants. The holders of Senior Indebtedness shall not have any rights under the Indenture to enforce any of the covenants contained in any of the other Articles of this Supplemental Indenture, including, without limitation, the covenants contained in Section 5.1 hereof limiting the payment of current interest on the Debt Securities while deferred interest is outstanding, in Sections 4.2 and 5.2 hereof limiting the source of funds for payment of Deferred Interest and in Section 5.4 hereof requiring the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect certain common stock sales. -33-
ARTICLE VII FORM OF NOTE Section 7.1 Form of Debt Security.

provided for. Through the final day of the Fixed Rate Period (or, if earlier, until the principal thereof is paid), each Outstanding Debt Security will bear interest at the per annum rate of 5.902% payable (subject to the interest deferral provisions of Article IV) semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on June 1, 2006, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at such Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually. During the Floating Rate Period, each Outstanding Debt Security will bear interest during each Quarterly Interest Accrual Period, payable (subject to the interest deferral provisions of Article IV) quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing March 1, 2011, at the rate equal to the lower of (i) 1.40% plus the highest of the (x) 3-Month LIBOR Rate; (y) 10-Year Treasury CMT, and (z) 30-Year Treasury CMT, as applicable for such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period and (ii) 13.25% (such rate the "Floating Rate" with respect to such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period) until the principal thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Floating Rate prevailing from time to time, compounded quarterly at such prevailing Floating Rates. During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable on any Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and the amount of interest payable for any period shorter or longer than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such 180-day semi-annual period. During the Floating Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any period will be computed by multiplying the annual Floating Rate in effect for the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period or portion thereof in respect of which the interest payment is made by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Quarterly Interest Accrual Period (or a portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 365, and multiplying the product obtained thereby by the principal amount hereof. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Debt Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and, in the case of a Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in said Indenture) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest installment. In the case of a Global Security or any Debt Securities of which the Property Trustee is the holder, such regular record date which, in respect of (i) Debt Securities of which the Property Trustee is the registered holder and the Preferred Securities are in book-entry only form or (ii) a Global Security, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if (i) the Debt Securities are held by the Property Trustee and the Preferred Securities are no longer in book-entry only form or (ii) the Debt Securities are not represented by a Global Security, the Company may select a regular record date at least one Business Day before an Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly -36-
provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holders on such regular record date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the registered holders of this series of Debt Securities not less than ten (10) days prior to such special record date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Debt Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest (including Compounded Interest, Additional Interest, Registration Default Damages and Gross-Up Payments, if any) on this Debt Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in Wilmington, Delaware, in any coin or currency of the United States of America which at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the holder of this Debt Security is the Property Trustee, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Debt Security will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Property Trustee. The indebtedness evidenced by this Debt Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Debt Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each holder of this Debt Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such Holder upon said provisions. This Debt Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee. The provisions of this Debt Security are continued on the reverse side hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed. -37-
Dated: THE STANLEY WORKS By: -------------------------------- Name: Title: Attest: By: ---------------------------- Assistant Secretary (FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION) CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Debt Securities of the series of Debt Securities described in the within-mentioned Indenture. HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Not in its individual capacity but solely as Trustee By: _____________________ Authorized Officer (FORM OF REVERSE OF NOTE) This Debt Security is one of a duly authorized series of Debt Securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Debt Securities"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of November 22, 2005, duly executed and delivered between the Company and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, not in its individual capacity but solely as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of November 22, 2005, between the Company and the Trustee (the Indenture, as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Debt Securities. By the terms of the Indenture, the Debt Securities are issuable in series which may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture. -38-
Upon the occurrence and continuation of a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event, as defined below, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debt Securities in whole, but not in part, for cash at the principal amount together with any interest accrued and unpaid thereon (the "Special Redemption Price") within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event. The Company shall have the right to redeem this Debt Security at the option of the Company, in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to December 1, 2010 at the Make Whole Redemption Price. In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem this Debt Security at the option of the Company, without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after December 1, 2010 (an "Optional Redemption"), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any, to the date of such redemption (the "Optional Redemption Price"). The Special Redemption Price, Make Whole Redemption Price or Optional Redemption Price, as applicable, shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York time, on the date of such redemption, or at such earlier time as the Company determines. Any redemption of the Debt Securities will be made upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice. If the Debt Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company pursuant to an Optional Redemption, the Debt Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; provided, that if at the time of redemption, the Debt Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine the principal amount of such Debt Securities beneficially held by each holder of a Debt Security to be redeemed. In the event of redemption of this Debt Security in part only, a new Debt Security or Debt Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. In case an Acceleration Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Debt Securities may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Debt Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the holder of each Debt Security so affected, (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Debt Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof; (ii) amend, modify or waive the Company's covenant to use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect certain stock -39-
sales without a prior to simultaneous irrevocable elimination of the restriction contained in the Indenture of the Company's ability to pay deferred interest other than from the proceeds of certain stock sales; or (iii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debt Securities, the holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the holders of the Debt Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Debt Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Debt Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Debt Security and of any Debt Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debt Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debt Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Debt Security at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed. So long as no Acceleration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the Debt Securities, from time to time, to elect to defer payment of interest on the Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date, provided that (i) no such deferral may extend beyond the maturity date of, or redemption date, for the Debt Securities and (ii) no Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event with respect to such Interest Payment Date has occurred prior to the issuance of the Company's notice of election ("Optional Deferral"). The Company may not elect Optional Deferral for an Interest Payment Date if the Optional Deferral Period ending on such Interest Payment Date, together with all consecutive Optional Deferral Periods and Mandatory Deferral Periods, or combination thereof, preceding such elected Optional Deferral Period, with respect to which any Deferred Interest remains outstanding, would exceed ten years. Interest on the Debt Securities will continue to accrue and compound during an Optional Deferral Period. Upon the termination of an Optional Deferral Period and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest, Registration Default Damages, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments then due, the Company may select a new period of Optional Deferral, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest shall be due and payable during a period of Optional Deferral, except at the end thereof, but the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during an Optional Deferral Period. In the event that the Company provides a notice of election of Optional Deferral for an Interest Payment Date prior to the Trigger Determination Date for such Interest Payment Date, the notice of election of Optional Deferral will control and the deferral of interest on such Interest Payment Date will be -40-
considered an Optional Deferral for all purposes notwithstanding the subsequent occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event on the Trigger Determination Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date. Subject to the following sentence, the Company shall not pay interest on the Debt Securities on any Interest Payment Date in an amount in excess of the New Common Equity Amount if a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event has occurred on the Trigger Determination Date with respect to such Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event, the Company shall pay all interest due and payable on the Debt Securities (i) on the maturity or earlier redemption thereof, and (ii) on the first Interest Payment Date to occur following deferral of interest on the Debt Securities due to Mandatory Deferral, Optional Deferral, or any combination thereof, that has continued without payment in full of all deferred interest for consecutive semi-annual and/or quarterly interest accrual periods aggregating to in excess of ten years. Deferral of interest on the Debt Securities required under the terms of the Indenture is referred to as "Mandatory Deferral." The Company shall give notice of any election of an Optional Deferral not fewer than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the Interest Payment Date for which interest on the Debt Securities will be deferred. If a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event has occurred as of any Trigger Determination Date, the Company shall give notice thereof not less than 15 days prior to the related Interest Payment Date. The Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued during the semi-annual interest accrual period or quarterly interest accrual period, as applicable, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, unless the Company pays therewith all Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on the Debt Securities. The Company may not pay Deferred Interest on any Interest Payment Date in an amount that exceeds the New Common Equity Amount for such Interest Payment Date. Each Holder of a Debt Security, by such Holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for interest deferred due to Mandatory Deferral and unpaid (and Compounded Interest, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments thereon), to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments thereon) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of the Debt Securities in respect of which such interest was deferred. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Debt Security is transferable by the registered holder hereof on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Debt Security for registration of transfer -41-
at the office or agency of the Trustee in New York, New York accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the registered holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Debt Securities of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Debt Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Debt Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Debt Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released. The Debt Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. [This Global Security is exchangeable for Debt Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.

All terms used in this Debt Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. -42-

Each holder of a Debt Security, by such holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for interest deferred due to Mandatory Deferral and unpaid (and Compounded Interest, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments thereon), to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest, Additional Interest and Gross-Up Payments thereon) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Debt Security in respect of which such interest was deferred. Amounts to which the Holders of the Debt Securities would have been entitled to receive hereunder, but for operation of this Section 9.1 are referred to as "Foregone Deferred Interest." -44-

act or acts or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Trustee shall be construed to be a duty. SECTION 3.03.

E. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of the Trust and to operate the Trust so that the Trust will not be deemed to be an "investment company" required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or taxed as other than a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes and so that the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities will be treated as indebtedness of the Sponsor for United States federal income tax purposes. In this connection, the Sponsor and the Administrative Trustees are authorized to take any action, not inconsistent with applicable law, the Certificate of Trust or this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, that each of the Sponsor and the Administrative Trustees determines in its discretion to be 19
necessary or desirable for such purposes, as long as such action does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Preferred Securities. Section 2.08 Assets of Trust. The assets of the Trust shall consist of the Trust Property. Section 2.09 Title to Trust Property. Legal title to all Trust Property shall be vested at all times in the Property Trustee (in its capacity as such) and shall be held and administered by the Property Trustee for the benefit of the Securityholders and the Trust in accordance with this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. The right, title and interest of the Property Trustee to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall vest automatically in each Person who may thereafter be appointed as Property Trustee in accordance with the terms hereof, and thereupon, such right, title and interest shall cease in the predecessor Property Trustee. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or not conveyancing documents have been executed and delivered. Section 2.10 Mergers and Consolidations of the Trust. The Trust may not consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except as described below or otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. The Trust may at the request of the Sponsor, with the consent of the Administrative Trustees and without the consent of the Holders of the Trust Securities, the Delaware Trustee or the Property Trustee, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by a trust organized as such under the laws of any state; provided that (i) such successor entity either (x) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Trust Securities or (y) substitutes for the Preferred Securities other securities having substantially the same terms as the Preferred Securities (herein referred to as the "Successor Securities") so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as the Preferred Securities rank in priority with respect to Distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise, (ii) the Sponsor expressly appoints a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee as the holder of legal title to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, (iii) if the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) are rated by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization prior to such transaction, such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not cause the Preferred Securities (including any Successor Securities) to be downgraded by any such nationally recognized statistical rating organization, (iv) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Trust Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, (v) such successor entity has a purpose substantially identical to that of the Trust, (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, or replacement, the Sponsor and the Property Trustee have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Holders of the Trust Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect and (B) following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement, neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and (vii) the Sponsor guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided by the Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust shall not, except with the consent of Holders of 100% in Liquidation Amount 20
of the Trust Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or replacement would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as other than a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes. Section 2.11 Obligations in the Event of Non-U.S. Merger. If, upon or after the occurrence of a Non-U.S. Merger, the Trust is required to withhold, or any Securityholder is required to pay, any present or future amount in respect of taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges on any Distribution on that Holder's Trust Securities by any taxing authority that would not have been withheld or imposed on that payment had the Non-U.S. Merger not occurred, the Trust will pay to each Securityholder an amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") equal to all additional amounts that may be necessary so that every net Distribution to the Holder will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in the Preferred Securities. The term "net Distribution" means the amount the Trust will pay to the Securityholder after the Trust's or that Securityholder's payment, deduction or withholding an amount for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges imposed with respect to that payment by any taxing authority that would not have been imposed if the Non-U.S. Merger had not occurred. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, to the extent that any withholding or imposition of any tax, duty, assessment or other governmental charge is assessed on different taxpayers at different rates, the rate applicable to each Holder of Trust Securities will be the highest marginal rate for the period in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made. Any reference in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, or the Trust Securities, to interest, Distributions or any other amount payable in respect of the Trust Securities also refers to any Gross-Up Payment payable with respect thereto pursuant to this Section 2.11. 21
ARTICLE 3 Payment Account Section 3.01 Payment Account. (a) On or prior to the Issue Date, the Property Trustee shall establish the Payment Account. The Property Trustee (and if deemed necessary by the Property Trustee, an agent of the Property Trustee) shall have exclusive control and sole right of withdrawal with respect to the Payment Account for the purpose of making deposits in and withdrawals from the Payment Account in accordance with this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. All monies and other property deposited or held from time to time in the Payment Account shall be held by the Property Trustee in the Payment Account for the exclusive benefit of the Securityholders and for distribution as herein provided, including (and subject to) any priority of payments provided for herein. (b) The Property Trustee shall deposit in the Payment Account, promptly upon receipt, all payments of principal or interest on, and any other payments or proceeds with respect to, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Amounts held in the Payment Account shall not be invested by the Property Trustee pending distribution thereof. 22
ARTICLE 4 Distributions; Redemption Section 4.01 Distributions. (a) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be cumulative and accrue from the Issue Date and, subject to paragraph (e) of this Section 4.01, shall be payable (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2006 (each a "Semi-Annual Distribution Date"); and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011 (each a "Quarterly Distribution Date"). If any date on which Distributions are otherwise payable on the Trust Securities is not a Business Day, then the payment of such Distribution shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and, in the case of a Semi-Annual Distribution Date, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). (b) (i) During the Fixed Rate Period, distributions payable on the Trust Securities shall be fixed at a rate of 5.902% per annum (the "Fixed Rate") of the Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities, such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Fixed Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually, through the end of the Fixed Rate Period. (ii) During the Floating Rate Period, distributions on each Trust Security will accrue during each Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, at a rate equal to the lower of (i) 1.40% plus the highest of the (x) 3-Month LIBOR Rate; (y) 10-Year Treasury CMT, and (z) 30-Year Treasury CMT, as applicable for such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period and (ii) 13.25% (such rate the "Floating Rate" with respect to such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, and such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Floating Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee) until the stated liquidation amount thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Floating Rate prevailing from time to time, compounded quarterly at such prevailing Floating Rate. (c) During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable on any Distribution Date will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and the amount of distributions payable for any period shorter or longer than a full semi-annual period for which distributions are computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such 180-day period. During the Floating Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable will be computed by multiplying the annual Floating Rate in effect for the Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period or portion thereof in respect of which the distribution is made by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period (or a portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 365, and multiplying the product obtained thereby by the stated liquidation amount of the Trust Securities. 23
(d) Distributions on the Trust Securities shall be made and shall be deemed payable on each Distribution Date, but only to the extent that the Trust has legally and immediately available funds in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. (e) An interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities may be deferred (i) in whole at the election of the Sponsor pursuant to Optional Deferral in accordance with the terms of Section 4.1 of the Supplemental Indenture permitting Optional Deferral, or (ii) in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2 of the Supplemental Indenture limiting interest payments in the case of a Mandatory Deferral (each a "Deferral"). As a consequence of any such Deferral, Distributions will also be deferred, in whole or in part, to the extent corresponding to the deferral on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, semi-annual or quarterly Distributions, as applicable, to the extent not paid as and when due will continue to accrue (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually on each Semi-Annual Distribution Date and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, at the Floating Rates applicable from time to time, compounded quarterly on each Quarterly Distribution Date. Amounts added to deferred Distributions due to such compounding are referred to herein as "Additional Amounts." Deferred Distributions, together with Additional Amounts, will be distributed to the Holders of the Trust Securities as received by the Trust at the end of any Deferral period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may distribute deferred amounts earlier if the Sponsor prepays interest deferred on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities prior to the end of any Deferral as permitted by the Junior Subordinated Indenture. (f) Distributions, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Trust Securities on each Distribution Date shall be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record date. While the Preferred Securities are in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates correspond to the interest payment dates on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. If the Preferred Securities are not in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Preferred Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the Preferred Securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Sponsor, which dates shall be at least one Business Day but not more than 60 Business Days before the relevant payment dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Preferred Securities. Distributions payable on the Trust Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution Date as a result of the Sponsor having failed to make a payment on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Trust Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Junior Subordinated Indenture. (g) In the event of the occurrence of a Registration Default under Section 8 of the Registration Rights Agreement with respect to any Preferred Security, the Trust shall pay Registration Default Damages in the form of additional distributions on such Preferred Security at the per annum rate of 0.25% of the Liquidation Amount thereof for so long as such Registration Default continues in accordance with and subject to the terms of Section 8 of the Registration 24
Rights Agreement. References to Distributions herein include references to such Registration Default Damages. (h) Each holder of a Trust Security, by such holder's acceptance thereof, agrees that in the event of any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Sponsor or in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with respect to the Sponsor, such holder shall not have a claim for deferred Distributions on such holder's Trust Security or to Additional Amounts and Gross-Up Payments in respect thereof, to the extent that such amounts correspond to Foregone Deferred Interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. (i) Each Trust Security, upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Trust Security, shall continue to carry the rights of Distributions accrued (including Additional Amounts, if any) and unpaid, and to accrue (including Additional Amounts, if any), which were carried by such Trust Security prior to such registration of transfer or exchange. Section 4.02 Redemption. (a) On each Indenture Redemption Date with respect to the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities (other than following the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to the holders of Trust Securities pursuant to Section 9.04), the Trust will be required to redeem a Like Amount of Trust Securities at the applicable Redemption Price. (b) Notice of redemption shall be given by the Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust Securities to be redeemed, at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of redemption shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the applicable Redemption Price; (iii) the CUSIP number of the Trust Securities to be redeemed; (iv) if less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed, the total Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities to be redeemed; and (v) that on the Redemption Date the applicable Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Trust Security to be redeemed and that Distributions thereon will cease to accrue on and after such date. (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed at the applicable Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be made and the applicable Redemption Price shall be deemed payable on each Redemption Date only to the extent that the Trust has funds legally and immediately available in the Payment Account for the payment of such Redemption Price. 25
(d) If the Property Trustee gives a notice of redemption in respect of any Preferred Securities, then, by 2:00 p.m. New York time, on the Redemption Date, subject to Section 4.02(c), the Property Trustee will, so long as the Preferred Securities are in book-entry only form, irrevocably deposit with the Clearing Agency for the Preferred Securities funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price. If the Preferred Securities are not in book-entry only form, the Property Trustee, subject to Section 4.02(c), shall irrevocably deposit with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price and will give the Paying Agent irrevocable instructions to pay such Redemption Price to the Holders thereof upon surrender of their Preferred Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust Securities called for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust Securities as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates for the related Distribution Dates. If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such deposit, all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive the applicable Redemption Price, but without interest, and such Securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any Redemption Price is payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the applicable Redemption Price payable on such date shall be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). In the event that payment of the applicable Redemption Price in respect of Trust Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Trust or by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue to accrue at the then applicable rate, from such Redemption Date originally established by the Trust for such Trust Securities to the date such Redemption Price is actually paid, and the actual payment date will be the Redemption Date for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price. (e) If less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on a Redemption Date, then, subject to Section 4.03, the particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro rata basis not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Property Trustee from the Outstanding Preferred Securities not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Property Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for a redemption of portions (equal to $1,000 or integral multiple thereof) of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Securities Registrar in writing of the Preferred Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Preferred Securities selected for partial redemption, the Liquidation Amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Preferred Securities shall relate, in the case of any Preferred Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Liquidation Amount of Preferred Securities which has been or is to be redeemed. (f) Less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities may not be redeemed unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Trust Securities for all semi-annual and/or quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption. (g) Subject to applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Sponsor, the Guarantor or their Affiliates may, at any time and from 26
time to time, purchase Outstanding Preferred Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement. Section 4.03 Subordination of Common Securities. (a) Payment of Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if any) on, and the applicable Redemption Price of, the Trust Securities, as the case may be, shall be made pro rata based on the aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities; provided, however, that if on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including Additional Amounts, if any) on, or the applicable Redemption Price of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if any) on all Outstanding Preferred Securities for all distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the applicable Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Preferred Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if any) on, or the applicable Redemption Price of, Preferred Securities then due and payable. (b) In the case of the occurrence of any Indenture Event of Default, the Holder of Common Securities will be deemed to have waived the right to act with respect to any such Indenture Event of Default until the effect of such Indenture Event of Default with respect to the Preferred Securities have been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until any such Indenture Event of Default has been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the Preferred Securities and not the Holder of the Common Securities, and only the Holders of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to act on their behalf. Section 4.04 Payment Procedures. Payments in respect of the Preferred Securities shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Securities Register or, if the Preferred Securities are held by a Clearing Agency, such Distributions shall be made to the Clearing Agency, which shall credit the relevant Persons' accounts at such Clearing Agency on the applicable distribution dates. Payments in respect of the Common Securities shall be made in such manner as shall be mutually agreed between the Property Trustee and the Holder of the Common Securities. Section 4.05 Tax Returns and Reports. The Administrative Trustee(s) shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the Sponsor's expense, and file all United States federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required to be filed by or in respect of the Trust. The Administrative Trustee(s) shall provide or cause to be provided on a timely basis to each Holder any Internal Revenue Service form required to be so provided in respect of the Trust Securities. 27

Section 5.02 The Trust Securities Certificates. Each of the Trust Securities Certificates shall be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. The Trust Securities Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature of at least one Administrative Trustee. Trust Securities Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be validly issued and entitled to the benefits of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the issuance and delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of issuance and delivery of such Trust Securities Certificates. A transferee of a Trust Securities Certificate shall become a Securityholder, and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a Securityholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Trust Securities Certificate in such transferee's name pursuant to Section 5.13. Section 5.03 Initial Issuance of Trust Securities Certificates. On the Issue Date, the Administrative Trustees shall cause Trust Securities Certificates, in an aggregate Liquidation Amount as provided in Sections 2.04 and 2.05, to be executed on behalf of the Trust. No Trust Securities Certificate shall entitle its holder to any benefit under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, or shall be valid for any purpose, unless there shall appear on such Trust Securities Certificate an original signature of one or more of the Administrative Trustees; such execution shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been duly issued and delivered hereunder. All Trust Securities Certificates shall be dated the date of their execution. Section 5.04 The Securities Registrar. The Securities Registrar shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 5.08, a Securities Register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Securities Registrar shall provide for the registration of Preferred Securities Certificates and the Common Securities Certificates (subject to Section 5.10 in the case of the Common Securities Certificates) and registration of transfers and exchanges of Preferred Securities Certificates as provided pursuant to Section 5.13. The Property Trustee shall be the initial Securities Registrar.

Administrative Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then in the absence of notice that such Trust Securities Certificate shall have been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Administrative Trustees or any one of them on behalf of the Trust shall execute and cause to be issued and made available for delivery, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Trust Securities Certificate, a new Trust Securities Certificate of like class, tenor and denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Trust Securities Certificate under this Section 5.05, the Administrative Trustees or the Securities Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Trust Securities Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 5.05 shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the Trust, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Trust Securities Certificate shall be found at any time. Section 5.06 Persons Deemed Securityholders. Prior to due presentation of a Trust Securities Certificate for registration of transfer, the Trustees or the Securities Registrar shall treat the Person in whose name any Trust Securities Certificate shall be registered in the Securities Register as the owner of such Trust Securities Certificate for the purpose of receiving Distributions (subject to Section 4.01) and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Trustees nor the Securities Registrar shall be bound by any notice to the contrary. Section 5.07 Access to List of Securityholders' Names and Addresses.

If three or more Securityholders or one or more Holders of Trust Securities Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate outstanding Liquidation Amount apply in writing to the Administrative Trustees, and such application states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Securityholders with respect to their rights under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust or under the Trust Securities Certificates and such application is accompanied by a copy of the communication that such applicants propose to transmit, then the Administrative Trustees shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of such application, afford such applicants access during normal business hours to the current list of Securityholders. Each Holder, by receiving and holding a Trust Securities Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed not to hold either the Sponsor or the Administrative Trustees accountable by reason of the disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from which such information was derived. Section 5.08 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Administrative Trustees shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, or Wilmington, Delaware, an office or offices or agency or agencies where Preferred Securities Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Trustees in 29

Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Payment Account for the purpose of making the Distributions and payments provided hereby. The Administrative Trustees may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if such Trustees determine in their sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust in any material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be the Property Trustee, and it may choose any co-paying agent that is acceptable to the Administrative Trustees and the Sponsor. Any Person acting as Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as Paying Agent upon 30 days written notice to the Administrative Trustees and the Sponsor. In the event that a Paying Agent shall resign or be removed, the Administrative Trustees shall appoint a successor that is acceptable to the Sponsor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust company). The Administrative Trustees shall cause such successor Paying Agent or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Administrative Trustees to execute and deliver to the Trustees an instrument in which such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustees that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Securityholders in trust for the benefit of the Securityholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Securityholders. The Paying Agent shall return all unclaimed funds to the Property Trustee and upon removal of a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its possession to the Property Trustee.

Administrative Trustees shall cancel the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificate. The Liquidation Amount of the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificate and the Regulation S Permanent Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Securities Registrar and the Clearing Agency or its nominee, as the case may be, in connection with transfers of interest as hereinafter provided. (c) The provisions of the "Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System" and "Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear" and the "General Terms and Conditions of Clearstream" and "Customer Handbook" of Clearstream shall be applicable to transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificate and the Regulation S Permanent Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates that are held by participants through Euroclear or Clearstream.

All Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates will be exchanged by the Administrative Trustees for Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates if (i) the Clearing Agency is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Clearing Agency or it is no longer a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed by the Administrative Trustees within 120 days after the date of such notice from the Clearing Agency or (ii) the Sponsor or Trust determines that the Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificates (in whole but not in part) should be exchanged for Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates and delivers a written notice to such effect to the Trustees; provided that in no event shall the Regulation S Temporary Book-Entry Preferred Securities Certificate be exchanged for Definitive Preferred Securities Certificates prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 6.01, in Sections 2.10, 8.10 or 10.03, in the Junior Subordinated Indenture, and as otherwise required by law, no Holder of Preferred Securities shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the administration, operation and management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust Securities Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Securityholders from time to time as partners or members of an association. (b) So long as any Junior Subordinated Debt Securities are held by the Property Trustee, the Trustees shall not (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Indenture Trustee, or executing any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee with respect to such Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, (ii) waive any past default under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration of acceleration that the principal of all the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Junior Subordinated Indenture or the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, where such consent shall be required, or to any other action, as holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, without, in each case, obtaining the prior approval of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities; provided, however, that where a consent under the Junior Subordinated Indenture would require the consent of each holder of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities affected thereby, no such consent shall be given by the Trustees without the prior written consent of each Holder of Preferred Securities. The Trustees shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities, except pursuant to a subsequent vote of the Holders of Preferred Securities. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Sponsor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes on account of such action. (c) If any proposed amendment to this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust provides for, or the Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Preferred Securities, whether by way of amendment to this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, other than pursuant to the terms of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, then the Holders of Outstanding Preferred Securities as a class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Sponsor, obtain an Opinion of Counsel experienced in such matters to the 48
effect that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes on account of such action. Section 6.02 Notice of Meetings. Notice of all meetings of the Preferred Securityholders, stating the time, place and purpose of the meeting, shall be given by the Administrative Trustees pursuant to Section 10.08 to each Preferred Securityholder of record, at his registered address, at least 15 days and not more than 90 days before the meeting. At any such meeting, any business properly before the meeting may be so considered whether or not stated in the notice of the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. Section 6.03 Meetings of Preferred Securityholders. No annual meeting of Securityholders is required to be held. The Administrative Trustees, however, shall call a meeting of Securityholders to vote on any matter upon the written request of the Preferred Securityholders of record of 25% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) and the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee may, at any time in their discretion, call a meeting of Preferred Securityholders to vote on any matters as to which Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote. Preferred Securityholders of record of 50% of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount), present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of Securityholders. If a quorum is present at a meeting, an affirmative vote by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, in person or by proxy, holding more than a majority of the Preferred Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) held by the Preferred Securityholders of record present, either in person or by proxy, at such meeting shall constitute the action of the Securityholders, unless this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Section 6.04 Voting Rights. Securityholders shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 of Liquidation Amount represented by their Trust Securities in respect of any matter as to which such Securityholders are entitled to vote. Section 6.05 Proxies, etc. At any meeting of Securityholders, any Securityholder entitled to vote may vote by proxy, provided that no proxy shall be voted at any meeting unless it shall have been placed on file with the Administrative Trustees, or with such other officer or agent of the Trust as the Administrative Trustees may direct, for verification prior to the time at which such vote shall be taken. A Securityholder may grant a proxy by any means permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property Trustee, proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or more officers of the Property Trustee. Only Securityholders of record shall be entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such Trust Securities, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a Securityholder shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to 49
its exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. No proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution. Section 6.06 Securityholder Action by Written Consent. Any action which may be taken by Securityholders at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if Securityholders holding at least a majority of all Outstanding Trust Securities (based upon their Liquidation Amount) entitled to vote in respect of such action (or such other proportion thereof as shall be required by any express provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust) shall consent to the action in writing. Section 6.07 Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes. For the purposes of determining the Securityholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting or by written consent, or to participate in any Distribution on the Trust Securities in respect of which a record date is not otherwise provided for in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, or for the purpose of any other action, the Administrative Trustees may from time to time fix a date, not more than 60 days prior to the date of any meeting of Securityholders or the payment of a Distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Securityholders of record for such purposes. Section 6.08 Acts of Securityholders. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust to be given, made or taken by Securityholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Securityholders in person or by an agent appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Administrative Trustees. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Securityholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and (subject to Section 8.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustees, if made in the manner provided in this Section 6.08. The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustees deem sufficient. The ownership of Preferred Securities shall be proved by the Securities Register. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Securityholder of any Trust Security shall bind every future Securityholder of the same Trust Security and the Securityholder of every Trust Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to 50
be done by the Trustees or the Trust in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security. Without limiting the foregoing, a Securityholder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount. If any dispute shall arise between the Securityholders of Trust Securities and the Administrative Trustees or among such Securityholders or Trustees with respect to the authenticity, validity or binding nature of any request, demand, authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or Trustee under this Article VI, then the determination of such matter by the Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter. Section 6.09 Inspection of Records. Upon reasonable notice to the Trustees, the records of the Trust, and the records of any Trustee as such records relate to the Trust, shall be open to inspection by Securityholders during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to such Securityholder's interest as a Securityholder. 51

ARTICLE 8 The Trustees Section 8.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) The rights, duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as provided by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and, in the case of the Property Trustee, the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of their rights or powers, if they shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to them. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustees shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 8.01. (b) All payments made by the Property Trustee in respect of the Trust Securities shall be made only from the income and proceeds from the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Property Trustee to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Securityholder, by its acceptance of a Trust Security, agrees that it will look solely to the income and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent available for distribution to it as herein provided and that the Trustees are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in respect of any Trust Security or for any other liability in respect of any Trust Security. This Section 8.01(b) does not limit the liability of the Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust or, in the case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act. (c) No Trustee shall be liable for its acts or omissions hereunder except as a result of its own gross negligence (or ordinary negligence in the case of the Property Trustee) or willful misconduct. To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Trustee has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to the Securityholders, such Trustee shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Securityholder for such Trustee's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. The provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Trustees otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Sponsor and the Securityholders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Trustees (other than the mandatory duties and liabilities of the Property Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act). (d) No provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust shall be construed to relieve the Property Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: 54
(i) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an authorized officer of the Property Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Property Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (ii) the Property Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Property Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust; (iii) the Property Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Payment Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Property Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitation on liability afforded to the Property Trustee under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and the Trust Indenture Act; (iv) the Property Trustee shall not be liable for any interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree with the Sponsor and money held by the Property Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in relation to the Payment Amount maintained by the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 3.01 and except to the extent otherwise required by law; and (v) the Property Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance by the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor with their respective duties under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, nor shall the Property Trustee be liable for the negligence, default or misconduct of the Administrative Trustees or the Sponsor. (e) Any direction or act of the Sponsor or the Administrative Trustees contemplated by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate; (f) Whenever in the administration of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust the Property Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder as to which the Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Property Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders of the Trust Securities which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the same proportion in Liquidation Amount of the Trust Securities as would be entitled to direct the Property Trustee under the terms of the Trust Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action; (ii) may refrain from enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are received; and (iii) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such instructions; and (g) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Property Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that is discretionary under the provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. No 55
provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust shall be deemed to impose any duty or obligations on the Property Trustee to perform any act or acts or exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Property Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Property Trustee shall be construed to be a duty. Section 8.02 Notice of Defaults and Deferrals. (a) Within 30 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default or Indenture Covenant Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.08, notice of such Event of Default or Indenture Covenant Event of Default to the Securityholders, the Administrative Trustees, the Guarantor and the Sponsor, unless such Event of Default or Indenture Covenant Event of Default shall have been cured or waived. (b) The Property Trustee shall promptly forward to the Securityholders, in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 10.08, any notice of an election of Optional Deferral or of the occurrence of a Mandatory Deferral Trigger Event that it receives pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Supplemental Indenture. Section 8.03 Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01 and except as provided by law: (i) the Property Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting in good faith upon any resolution, Opinion of Counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (ii) if (A) in performing its duties under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust the Property Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of action, or (B) in construing any of the provisions in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust the Property Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other provisions contained herein, or (C) the Property Trustee is unsure of the application of any provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, then, except as to any matter as to which the Preferred Securityholders are entitled to vote under the terms of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Property Trustee shall deliver a notice to the Sponsor requesting written instructions of the Sponsor as to the course of action to be taken. The Property Trustee shall take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or to refrain from taking, by the Sponsor; provided, however, that if the Property Trustee does not receive such instructions of the Sponsor within ten Business Days after it has delivered such notice, or such reasonably shorter period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent practicable shall not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust as 56
it shall deem advisable and in the best interests of the Securityholders, in which event the Property Trustee shall have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct; (iii) the Property Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (iv) the Property Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust at the request or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Property Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (v) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Securityholders; and (vi) the Property Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its agents or attorneys, provided that the Property Trustee shall be responsible for its own negligence or recklessness with respect to selection of any agent or attorney appointed by it hereunder. Section 8.04 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Trust Securities Certificates shall be taken as the statements of the Trust, and the Trustees do not assume any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustees shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Trust of the proceeds of the Trust Securities in accordance with Section 2.05. The Property Trustee may conclusively assume that any funds held by it hereunder are legally available unless a Responsible Officer shall have received written notice from the Sponsor, any Holder or any other Trustee that such funds are not legally available. Section 8.05 May Hold Securities. Except as provided in the definition of the term "Outstanding" in Article I, any Trustee or any other agent of the Trustees or the Trust, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and may otherwise deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not a Trustee or such other agent. Section 8.06 Compensation; Fees; Indemnity. The Sponsor agrees: 57
(1) to pay to the Trustees from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by the Trustees hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustees upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance with any provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of their agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to their willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustees for, and to hold the Trustees harmless against, any and all loss, damage, claims, liability or expense incurred without willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith on their part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, including the costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder. The provisions of this Section 8.06 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Trustee or the termination of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. Section 8.07 Trustees Required; Eligibility. (a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. The Property Trustee shall be a Person that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 8.07, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Property Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.07, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article 8. (b) There shall at all times be one or more Administrative Trustees hereunder with respect to the Trust Securities. Each Administrative Trustee shall be either a natural person who is at least 21 years of age or a legal entity that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. (c) There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee with respect to the Trust Securities. The Delaware Trustee shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and a resident of the State of Delaware or (ii) a legal entity authorized to conduct a trust business and with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware that shall act through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. Section 8.08 Conflicting Interests. If the Property Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. To the 58
extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall not be deemed to have a conflicting interest by virtue of being trustee under the Guarantee. Section 8.09 Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee. At any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Property may at the time be located, the Holder of the Common Securities and the Property Trustee shall have power to appoint, and upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Sponsor shall for such purpose join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint, one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Property Trustee, of all or any part of such Trust Property, or to act as separate trustee of any such Trust Property, in either case with such powers as may be provided in the instrument of appointment, and to vest in such Person or Persons in the capacity aforesaid, any property, title, right or power deemed necessary or desirable, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.09. If the Sponsor does not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, or in case an Indenture Acceleration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee alone shall have power to make such appointment. Any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed pursuant to this Section 8.09 shall satisfy the requirements of Section 8.07. Should any written instrument from the Sponsor be required by any co-trustee or separate trustee so appointed for more fully confirming to such co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right, or power, any and all such instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged, and delivered by the Sponsor. Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely: (i) The Trust Securities shall be executed, issued and delivered and all rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, cash and other personal property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustees hereunder, shall be exercised, solely by the Trustees. (ii) The rights, powers, duties, and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Property Trustee or by the Property Trustee and such co-trustee or separate trustee jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee or separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Property Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event such rights, powers, duties, and obligations shall be exercised and performed by such co-trustee or separate trustee. (iii) The Property Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the written concurrence of the Sponsor, may accept the resignation of or remove any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed under this Section 8.09, and, in case an Indenture Acceleration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Property Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any such co-trustee or separate trustee 59
without the concurrence of the Sponsor. Upon the written request of the Property Trustee, the Sponsor shall join with the Property Trustee in the execution, delivery, and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or removal. A successor to any co-trustee or separate trustee so resigned or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section 8.09. (iv) No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of the Property Trustee, or any other such trustee hereunder. (v) The Trustees shall not be liable by reason of any act of a co-trustee or separate trustee. (vi) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee. Section 8.10 Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. No resignation or removal of any Trustee (the "Relevant Trustee") and no appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee pursuant to this Article 8 shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Relevant Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. The Relevant Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Securityholders. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Relevant Trustee required by Section 8.11 shall not have been delivered to the Relevant Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Relevant Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Relevant Trustee may be removed at any time by an Act of the Holder of the Common Securities, provided, however, that an Administrative Trustee may be appointed, removed or replaced only by an Act of the Holders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Property Trustee and the Delaware Trustee may be removed at such time by Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities Certificates, delivered to such Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). If the Relevant Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as Trustee at a time when no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holder of the Common Securities, by an Act of the Holder of the Common Securities delivered to the retiring Relevant Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees, and the retiring Relevant Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If the Delaware Trustee or Property Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of continuing to act as such at a time when an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Holders of Preferred Securities, by an Act of the Securityholders of a majority in Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities then outstanding delivered to the retiring Trustee, shall promptly appoint a successor Delaware Trustee or Property Trustee, and the Delaware Trustee or Property Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 8.11. If no successor 60
Relevant Trustee shall have been so appointed in accordance with this Section 8.10 and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 8.11, any Securityholder who has been a Securityholder of Trust Securities for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. The retiring Relevant Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Relevant Trustee, and each appointment of a successor Trustee to all Securityholders in the manner provided in Section 10.08 and shall give notice to the Sponsor. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Relevant Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust Office if it is the Property Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, in the event any Administrative Trustee or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or becomes incompetent or incapacitated or resigns, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity or resignation may be filled by (i) the act of the remaining Administrative Trustee or (ii) otherwise by the Sponsor (with the successor in each case being an individual who satisfies the eligibility requirement for Administrative Trustees set forth in Section 8.07). Additionally, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, in the event the Sponsor believes that any Administrative Trustee has become incompetent or incapacitated, the Sponsor, by notice to the remaining Trustees, may terminate the status of such Person as an Administrative Trustee (in which case the vacancy so created will be filled in accordance with the preceding sentence). Section 8.11 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Relevant Trustee, every such successor Relevant Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Trust and to the retiring Relevant Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Relevant Trustee shall become effective and such successor Relevant Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but, on the request of the Sponsor or the successor Relevant Trustee, such retiring Relevant Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Relevant Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Relevant Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Relevant Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Relevant Trustee hereunder. Upon request of any such successor Relevant Trustee, the Trust shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Relevant Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the preceding paragraph. No successor Relevant Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Relevant Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article 8. Section 8.12 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any Person into which the Property Trustee, Delaware Trustee or any Administrative Trustee which is not a natural person may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or 61
any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article 8, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. Section 8.13 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Sponsor or Trust. If and when the Property Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Sponsor or the Trust (or any other obligor upon the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities or the Trust Securities), the Property Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Sponsor or Trust (or any such other obligor). For purposes of Section 311(b)(4) and (6) of the Trust Indenture Act: (a) "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand; and (b) "self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Sponsor or the Trust (or any such obligor) for the purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing, shipment, storage or sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing title to, possession of, or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the Property Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the Sponsor or the Trust (or any such obligor) arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation. Section 8.14 Reports by Property Trustee. (a) Within 60 days after May 15 of each year commencing with May 15, 2006, if required by Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Property Trustee shall transmit a brief report dated as of such May 15 with respect to any of the events specified in such Section 313(a) that may have occurred since the later of the date of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust or the preceding May 15. (b) The Property Trustee shall transmit to Securityholders the reports required by Section 313(b) of the Trust Indenture Act at the times specified therein. (c) Reports pursuant to this Section 8.14 shall be transmitted in the manner and to the Persons required by Sections 313(c) and (d) of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.15 Reports to the Property Trustee. The Sponsor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee (i) such documents, reports and information as required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act (if any), and (ii) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Sponsor, the compliance certificate required by Section 314(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act in the form and in the manner required by Section 314 of the Trust Indenture Act. Delivery of reports to the Property Trustee pursuant to Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act is for informational purposes only and the Property 62
Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Sponsor's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder. Section 8.16 Evidence of Compliance with Conditions Precedent. Each of the Sponsor and the Administrative Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall provide to the Property Trustee such evidence of compliance with any conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust that relate to any of the matters set forth in Section 314(c) of the Trust Indenture Act. Any certificate or opinion required to be given pursuant to Section 314(c)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act shall comply with Section 314(e) of the Trust Indenture Act. Section 8.17 Number of Trustees. (a) The number of Trustees shall initially be five, provided that the Sponsor by written instrument may increase or decrease the number of Administrative Trustees. (b) If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Administrative Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 8.17(a), or if the number of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 8.17(a), a vacancy shall occur. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 8.10. (c) The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate to annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Administrative Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of an Administrative Trustee in accordance with Section 8.10, the Administrative Trustees in office, regardless of their number (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust), shall have all powers granted to the Administrative Trustees and shall discharge the duties imposed upon the Administrative Trustees by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. Section 8.18 Delegation of Power. (a) Any Administrative Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 2.07(A), including any registration statement or amendment thereto filed with the Commission, or making any other governmental filing; and (b) The Administrative Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Administrative Trustees or otherwise as the Administrative Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein. Section 8.19 Enforcement of Rights of Property Trustee by Securityholders. 63
(a) If an Acceleration Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Property Trustee may enforce its rights against the Sponsor and the Guarantor as the holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and the Guarantee Trustee under the Guarantee. In addition, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities will have the right to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Property Trustee under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, including the right to direct the Property Trustee to exercise the remedies available to it as a holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, provided that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, and would not involve the Property Trustee in personal liability in circumstances where reasonable indemnity would not be adequate. If the Property Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, a Holder of Preferred Securities may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, institute a legal proceeding against the Sponsor or the Guarantor or both to enforce its rights under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust without first instituting any legal proceeding against the Property Trustee or any other Person, including the Trust; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if an Acceleration Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and such Acceleration Event of Default is attributable to the Sponsor's failure to pay interest, principal or other required payments on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities issued to the Trust on the date that interest, principal or other payment is otherwise payable, a Holder of Preferred Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Sponsor or the Guarantor or both, without first instituting a legal proceeding against or requesting or directing that action be taken by the Property Trustee or any other Person, for enforcement of payment to such Holder of principal, interest, or other required payments on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such Holder on or after the due dates therefor specified or provided for in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. (b) In the event of a Covenant Event of Default, the Holders of at least 10% in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities may institute a legal proceeding against the Trust or the Trustees regarding the Covenant Event of Default and pursue any applicable remedy, it being understood that the remedy of acceleration of the liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities or of the principal of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities is not provided for hereunder in such circumstance. (c) In the event of an Indenture Covenant Event of Default, the Property Trustee shall institute a suit for damages on behalf of the Trust, as holder of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, if so directed by the Holders of at least 10% in Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities. (d) The Sponsor or the Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holders of Preferred Securities in respect of any amounts paid to such Holders by the Sponsor or the Guarantor pursuant to this Section 8.19. 64
ARTICLE 9 Termination and Liquidation Section 9.01 Termination Upon Expiration Date. The Trust shall automatically dissolve and terminate on November 21, 2060 (the "Expiration Date") or earlier pursuant to Section 9.02. Section 9.02 Early Termination. Upon the first to occur of any of the following events (such first occurrence, an "Early Termination Event"), the Trust shall be dissolved and terminated in accordance with the terms hereof: (i) the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Event in respect of the Sponsor, dissolution or liquidation of the Sponsor, or the dissolution of the Trust pursuant to judicial decree; (ii) the delivery of written direction to the Property Trustee by the Sponsor at any time (which direction is optional and wholly within the discretion of the Sponsor) to terminate the Trust and distribute the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to Securityholders as provided in Section 9.04; and (iii) the payment at maturity or redemption of all of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, and the consequent payment of the Preferred Securities. Section 9.03 Termination. The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Trust and the Trustees created hereby shall terminate upon the latest to occur of the following: (a) the distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities by the Property Trustee to Securityholders upon the liquidation of the Trust pursuant to Section 9.04, or, upon the redemption of all of the Trust Securities pursuant to Section 4.02, the distribution of all amounts or instruments required to be distributed hereunder upon the final payment of the Trust Securities; (b) the payment of any expenses owed by the Trust; (c) the discharge of all administrative duties of the Administrative Trustees, including the performance of any tax reporting obligations with respect to the Trust or the Securityholders; and (d) the filing by the Sponsor of a certificate of cancellation pursuant to the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. Section 9.04 Liquidation. (a) If any Early Termination Event specified in clause (i) of Section 9.02 occurs, the Trust shall be liquidated by the Administrative Trustees. (b) If the Trust automatically terminates upon the occurrence of the Expiration Date or if any Early Termination Event specified in clause (ii) of Section 9.02 occurs, the Trust shall be liquidated and the Property Trustee shall distribute any Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to the Securityholders as provided in Sections 9.04(c)-(f). (c) In connection with a distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, each Holder of Trust Securities shall be entitled to receive, after the satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (as evidenced by a certificate of the Administrative Trustees), a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. Notice of liquidation shall be given by the Trustees by 65
first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Liquidation Date to each Holder of Trust Securities at such Holder's address appearing in the Securities Register. All notices of liquidation shall: (i) state the Liquidation Date; (ii) state that from and after the Liquidation Date, the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding and any Trust Securities Certificates not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities; and (iii) provide such information with respect to the mechanics by which Holders may exchange Trust Securities Certificates for Junior Subordinated Debt Securities as the Administrative Trustees or the Property Trustee shall deem appropriate. (d) In order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to Securityholders, the Property Trustee shall establish a record date for such distribution (which shall be not more than 45 days prior to the Liquidation Date) and, either itself acting as exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate exchange agent, shall establish such procedures as it shall deem appropriate to effect the distribution of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in exchange for the Outstanding Trust Securities Certificates. (e) After the Liquidation Date, (i) the Trust Securities will no longer be deemed to be Outstanding, (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities will be issued to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates, upon surrender of such certificates to the Administrative Trustees or their agent for exchange, (iii) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent a Like Amount of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, accruing interest at the rate provided for in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities from the last Distribution Date on which a Distribution was made on such Trust Certificates until such certificates are so surrendered (and until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal will be made to Holders of Trust Securities Certificates with respect to such Junior Subordinated Debt Securities) and (iv) all rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive Junior Subordinated Debt Securities upon surrender of Trust Securities Certificates. (f) The Sponsor will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to have the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities that are distributed in exchange for the Preferred Securities listed on any securities exchange on which the Preferred Securities are then listed. The Sponsor may elect to have the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities issued in book-entry form to the Clearing Agency or its nominee. (g) In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 9.04, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, distribution of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in the manner provided herein is determined by the Administrative Trustees not to be practical, the Trust Property shall be liquidated, and the Trust shall be dissolved, wound-up or terminated in such manner as the Administrative Trustees reasonably determine. In such event, the Holders will be entitled to 66
receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors, an amount equal to the Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"). If such Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then, subject to the next succeeding sentence, the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust Securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation Amounts). The Holder of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive Liquidation Distributions upon any such dissolution, winding-up or termination pro rata (determined as aforesaid) with Holders of Preferred Securities, except that, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Preferred Securities shall have a priority over the Common Securities. 67

The Sponsor shall, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, execute and deliver the Expense Agreement. Section 10.02 Limitation of Rights of Securityholders. The death or incapacity of any Person having an interest, beneficial or otherwise, in a Trust Security shall not operate to terminate this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such Person or any Securityholder for such Person, to claim an accounting, take any action or bring any proceeding in and for a partition or winding up of the arrangements contemplated hereby, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them. Section 10.03 Amendment. (a) This Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust may be amended from time to time by the Trustees and the Sponsor, without the consent of any Securityholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, which shall not be inconsistent with the other provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, or (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust to such extent as shall be necessary to ensure that the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes at any time that any Trust Securities are outstanding; provided, however, that any such amendment shall not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any Securityholder. Any amendments of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust pursuant to this Section 10.03(a) shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Securityholders. (b) Except as provided in Section 6.01(c) and Section 10.03(c), any provision in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust may be amended by the Trust or the Trustees with (i) the consent of Securityholders representing not less than a majority (based upon Liquidation Amounts) of the Trust Securities then Outstanding (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.03 or 6.06) and (ii) receipt by the Trustees of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the Trustees in accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust's status as a grantor trust/fixed investment trust for United States federal income tax purposes or the Trust's exemption from status of an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. (c) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, without the consent of each Securityholder (such consent being obtained in accordance with Section 6.03 or 6.06), this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust 68
may not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the Trust Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required to be made in respect of the Trust Securities as of a specified date, (ii) restrict the right of a Securityholder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date, or (iii) change the consent required pursuant to this Section 10.03. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Trustees shall not enter into or consent to any amendment to this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust which would cause the Trust (i) to fail or cease to qualify for the exemption from status of an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, afforded by Rule 3a-5 thereunder or (ii) not to be characterized for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust/fixed investment trust and each Securityholder not to be treated as owning an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. (e) Without the consent of the Sponsor, this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust may not be amended in a manner which imposes any additional obligation on the Sponsor. In executing any amendment permitted by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, the Trustees shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 8.03) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate each stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized or permitted by this Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust.

EXHIBIT A THIS CERTIFICATE IS NOT TRANSFERABLE EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED DECLARATION OF TRUST REFERRED TO HEREIN Certificate Number: C-1 Number of Common Securities: 100 Certificate Evidencing Common Securities of The Stanley Works Capital Trust I 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Common Securities (Liquidation amount $1,000 per Common Security) The Stanley Works Capital Trust I, a statutory trust created under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Trust"), hereby certifies that The Stanley Works, a Connecticut corporation (the "Holder"), is the registered owner of ONE HUNDRED (100) common securities of the Trust representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust and designated the 5.902% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Common Securities (liquidation amount $1,000 per Common Security) (the "Common Securities"). In accordance with Section 5.10 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (as defined below), the Common Securities are not transferable, except by operation of law, or to a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Sponsor, and any attempted transfer in violation hereof shall be void. The designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Common Securities are set forth in, and this certificate and the Common Securities represented hereby are issued and shall in all respects be subject to the terms and provisions of, the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Trust, dated as of November 22, 2005, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust"), including the designation of the terms of the Common Securities as set forth therein. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning given to them in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. The Trust will furnish a copy of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and the Junior Subordinated Indenture to the Holder without charge upon written request to the Trust at its principal place of business or registered office. Upon receipt of this certificate, the Holder is bound by the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and is entitled to the benefits thereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, an Administrative Trustee of the Trust has executed this certificate this ____ day of ________, _____. THE STANLEY WORKS CAPITAL TRUST I By: _________________________________ [Name] as Administrative Trustee A-2
[FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY] During the Fixed Rate Period, distributions payable on the Common Securities shall be fixed at a rate of 5.902% per annum of the Liquidation Amount of the Common Securities, such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Fixed Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually, through the end of the Fixed Rate Period. During the Floating Rate Period, distributions on each Common Security will accrue during each Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, at a rate equal to the lower of (i) 1.40% plus the highest of the (x) 3-Month LIBOR Rate; (y) 10-Year Treasury CMT, and (z) 30-Year Treasury CMT, as applicable for such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period and (ii) 13.25% (such rate the "Floating Rate" with respect to such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, and such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Floating Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee) until the stated liquidation amount thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Floating Rate prevailing from time to time, compounded quarterly at such prevailing Floating Rate. Distributions on the Common Securities shall be made and shall be deemed payable on each Distribution Date, but only to the extent that the Trust has legally and immediately available funds in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable on any Distribution Date will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and the amount of distributions payable for any period shorter or longer than a full semi-annual period for which distributions are computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such 180-day period. During the Floating Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable will be computed by multiplying the annual Floating Rate in effect for the Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period or portion thereof in respect of which the distribution is made by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period (or a portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 365, and multiplying the product obtained thereby by the stated liquidation amount hereof. Distributions on the Common Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the Issue Date and, subject to any Deferral, shall be payable (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2006 (each a "Semi-Annual Distribution Date"); and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011 (each a "Quarterly Distribution Date"). Distributions, including Additional Amounts, if any on the Common Securities on each Distribution Date will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Preferred Securities. While the Preferred Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates. If the Preferred Securities are not in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Preferred Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the Preferred Securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Sponsor, which dates shall be at least one Business Day but not more than 60 Business Days before the relevant payment dates. An interest payment on the Junior Subordinated A-3
Debt Securities may be deferred (i) in whole at the election of the Sponsor pursuant to Optional Deferral in accordance with the terms of Section 4.1 of the Supplemental Indenture permitting Optional Deferral, or (ii) in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2 of the Supplemental Indenture limiting interest payments in the case of a Mandatory Deferral (each a "Deferral"). As a consequence of any such Deferral, Distributions will also be deferred, in whole or in part, to the extent corresponding to the deferral on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, provided that semi-annual or quarterly Distributions, as applicable, to the extent not paid as and when due will continue to accrue (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually on each Semi-Annual Distribution Date and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, at the Floating Rates applicable from time to time, compounded quarterly on each Quarterly Distribution Date. Amounts added to deferred Distributions due to such compounding are referred to herein as "Additional Amounts." Deferred Distributions, together with Additional Amounts, will be distributed to the Holders of the Trust Securities as received by the Trust at the end of any Deferral period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may distribute deferred amounts earlier if the Sponsor prepays interest deferred on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities prior to the end of any Deferral as permitted by the Junior Subordinated Indenture. The holder hereof, by such holder's acceptance hereof, agrees that in the event of any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Sponsor upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with respect to the Sponsor, such holder shall not have a claim for deferred Distributions and Additional Amounts thereon, to the extent that such amounts correspond to amounts in respect of Foregone Deferred Interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. If on any Distribution Date or Redemption Date an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any Distribution (including Additional Amounts, if any) on, or the applicable Redemption Price of, any Common Security, and no other payment on account of the redemption, liquidation or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if any) on all Outstanding Preferred Securities for all distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the applicable Redemption Price the full amount of such Redemption Price on all Outstanding Preferred Securities, shall have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the Property Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all Distributions (including Additional Amounts, if any) on, or the applicable Redemption Price of, Preferred Securities then due and payable. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the Property Trustee may, at the direction of the Sponsor, at any time liquidate the Trust and cause the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be distributed to the holders of the Trust Securities in liquidation of the Trust or, simultaneously with any redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, cause a Like Amount of the Trust Securities to be redeemed by the Trust. The Common Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. A-4

[FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY] During the Fixed Rate Period, distributions payable on the Preferred Securities shall be fixed at a rate of 5.902% per annum of the Liquidation Amount of the Preferred Securities, such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Fixed Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually, through the end of the Fixed Rate Period. During the Floating Rate Period, distributions on each Preferred Security will accrue during each Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, at a rate equal to the lower of (i) 1.40% plus the highest of the (x) 3-Month LIBOR Rate; (y) 10-Year Treasury CMT, and (z) 30-Year Treasury CMT, as applicable for such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period and (ii) 13.25% (such rate the "Floating Rate" with respect to such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period, and such rate being the rate of interest payable during the Floating Rate Period on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be held by the Property Trustee) until the stated liquidation amount thereof is paid, and (to the extent that payment of such distributions is enforceable under applicable law) distributions on any overdue installment of distributions shall accrue at the Floating Rate prevailing from time to time, compounded quarterly at such prevailing Floating Rate. Distributions on the Preferred Securities shall be made and shall be deemed payable on each Distribution Date, but only to the extent that the Trust has legally and immediately available funds in the Payment Account for the payment of such Distributions. During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable on any Distribution Date will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and the amount of distributions payable for any period shorter or longer than a full semi-annual period for which distributions are computed will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in such 180-day period. During the Floating Rate Period, the amount of distributions payable will be computed by multiplying the annual Floating Rate in effect for the Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period or portion thereof in respect of which the distribution is made by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the actual number of days in such Quarterly Distribution Accrual Period (or a portion thereof) (determined by including the first day thereof and excluding the last day thereof) and the denominator of which will be 365, and multiplying the product obtained thereby by the stated liquidation amount hereof. Distributions on the Preferred Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the Issue Date and, subject to any Deferral, shall be payable (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2006 (each a "Semi-Annual Distribution Date"); and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, quarterly on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011 (each a "Quarterly Distribution Date"). Distributions, including Additional Amounts, if any on the Preferred Securities on each Distribution Date will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the relevant record dates. While the Preferred Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates. If the Preferred Securities are not in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Preferred Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the Preferred Securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Sponsor, which dates shall be at least one Business Day but not more than 60 Business Days before the relevant payment dates. An interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities may be deferred (i) in whole at the election of the Sponsor pursuant to Optional Deferral in accordance C-6
with the terms of Section 4.1 of the Supplemental Indenture permitting Optional Deferral, or (ii) in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of Section 4.2 of the Supplemental Indenture limiting interest payments in the case of a Mandatory Deferral (each a "Deferral"). As a consequence of any such Deferral, Distributions will also be deferred, in whole or in part, to the extent corresponding to the deferral on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, provided that semi-annual or quarterly Distributions, as applicable, to the extent not paid as and when due will continue to accrue (i) during the Fixed Rate Period, at the Fixed Rate, compounded semi-annually on each Semi-Annual Distribution Date and (ii) during the Floating Rate Period, at the Floating Rates applicable from time to time, compounded quarterly on each Quarterly Distribution Date. Amounts added to deferred Distributions due to such compounding are referred to herein as "Additional Amounts." Deferred Distributions, together with Additional Amounts, will be distributed to the Holders of the Trust Securities as received by the Trust at the end of any Deferral period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may distribute deferred amounts earlier if the Sponsor prepays interest deferred on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities prior to the end of any Deferral as permitted by the Junior Subordinated Indenture. The holder hereof, by such holder's acceptance hereof, agrees that in the event of any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Sponsor upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law with respect to the Sponsor, such holder shall not have a claim for deferred Distributions and Additional Amounts thereon, to the extent that such amounts correspond to amounts in respect of Foregone Deferred Interest on the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities. In addition to the rights provided to the holders of the Preferred Securities under the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of the Trust, holders of Preferred Securities that are Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2005, among the Trust, The Stanley Works and the initial purchasers of the Preferred Securities therein named), shall have all the rights set forth in such Registration Rights Agreement. In the event of a Non-U.S. Merger with respect to The Stanley Works, the holder hereof shall have the right to receive Gross-Up Payments, if and to the extent such payments are required pursuant to the Junior Subordinated Indenture. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and the Junior Subordinated Indenture, the Property Trustee may, at the direction of the Sponsor, at any time liquidate the Trust and cause the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities to be distributed to the holders of the Trust Securities in liquidation of the Trust or, simultaneously with any redemption of the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities, cause a Like Amount of the Trust Securities to be redeemed by the Trust. The Preferred Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust. C-7

Securities (x) could not under Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement rely on the position of the Commission in Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation (pub. avail.

The Guarantor and the Trust shall use their best efforts to cause the CUSIP Service Bureau to issue the same CUSIP number for such New Securities as for New Securities issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer. 3.

(a) If (i) due to any change in law or applicable interpretations thereof by the Commission's staff, the Guarantor determines upon advice of its outside counsel that it or the Trust is not permitted to effect the Registered Exchange Offer as contemplated by Section 2 hereof; (ii) for any other reason the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 300 days of the date hereof; (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to Securities that are not eligible to be exchanged for New Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and that are held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, provided that such request shall be made to the Guarantor and the Trust in writing prior to 7
the 20th day following the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer; (iv) any Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) notifies the guarantor and the Trust in writing prior to the 20th day following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer that is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer; or (v) in the case of any Initial Purchaser that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer or acquires New Securities pursuant to Section 2(f) hereof, such Initial Purchaser notifies the Guarantor and the Trust in writing prior to the 20th day following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer that it has not received freely tradeable New Securities in exchange for Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment (it being understood that (x) the requirement that an Initial Purchaser deliver a Prospectus containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Act in connection with sales of New Securities acquired in exchange for such Securities shall result in such New Securities being not "freely tradeable"; and (y) the requirement that an Exchanging Dealer deliver a Prospectus in connection with sales of New Securities acquired in the Registered Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities shall not result in such New Securities being not "freely tradeable"), the Guarantor and the Trust shall effect a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with subsection (b) below. (b) (i) The Guarantor and the Trust shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 90 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 3), use their reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective under the Act, within 180 days after so required or requested, a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the offer and sale of the Securities or the New Securities, as applicable, together with the Debentures or New Debentures underlying such Securities or New Securities and the Guarantee or New Guarantee of the Securities or New Securities, by the Holders of the Securities or the New Securities from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders and set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement; provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder; and provided further, that with respect to New Securities received by an Initial Purchaser in exchange for Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment, the Guarantor and the Trust may, if permitted by then-current rules or regulations, or then-current interpretations by the Commission's staff, file a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement containing the information required by Item 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K, as applicable, in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection with respect thereto, and any such Exchange Offer Registration Statement, as so amended or supplemented, shall be referred to herein as, and governed by the provisions herein applicable to, a Shelf Registration Statement. (ii) The Guarantor and the Trust shall use their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the Act, in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to be usable by Holders for a period the "Shelf Registration Period") from the date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission until the earlier of (A) the second anniversary after the Closing Date or (B) the date upon which no Registrable Securities are outstanding. Both the 8
Guarantor and the Trust shall be deemed not to have used their reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Registration Period if either voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities at any time during the Shelf Registration Period, unless such action is (x) required by applicable law or (y) otherwise undertaken by the Guarantor or the Trust in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including avoidance of the Guarantor and the Trust's obligations hereunder), including the acquisition or divestiture of assets, and the Guarantor and the Trust promptly thereafter comply with the requirements of Section 4(k) hereof, if applicable. (iii) The Guarantor and the Trust shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, (A) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act; and (B) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. 4.

In such circumstances, the period of effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 2 shall be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of a notice of suspension pursuant to Section 4(c) to and including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Exchanging Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented Prospectus pursuant to this Section.

any regulatory entity, governmental agency or authority or self-regulatory agency of securities exchange having or asserting regulatory powers over any such recipient's activities, or such information is or becomes available to the public generally or through a third party, other than by such Holder, attorney, accountant or other agent, without an accompanying obligation of confidentiality; (iii) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, make such representations and warranties to the requesting party, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten offerings and covering matters including, but not limited to, those set forth in the Purchase Agreement; (iv) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, obtain opinions of counsel to the Guarantor and the Trust and updates thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably satisfactory to the requesting party and its counsel, addressed to the requesting party, covering such matters as are customarily covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested by the requesting party or its counsel; (v) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants of the Guarantor and the Trust (and, if necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any subsidiary of the Guarantor or of any business acquired by the Guarantor for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be, included in the Registration Statement), addressed to the requesting party, in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings, or if requested by the requesting party or its counsel in lieu of a "comfort" letter, an agreed-upon procedures letter under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 35, covering matters requested by the requesting party or its counsel; and (vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the requesting party or its counsel, including those to evidence compliance with Section 4(k) and with conditions customarily contained in underwriting agreements. The foregoing actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this Section shall be performed at the close of the Registered Exchange Offer and the effective date of any post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. (t) If a Registered Exchange Offer is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Securities by Holders to the Trust or the Guarantor (or to such other person as directed by the Trust or the Guarantor) in exchange for the New Securities, the Trust or the Guarantor shall mark, or caused to be marked, on the Securities so exchanged that such Securities are being cancelled in exchange for the New Securities. Concurrently with such exchange of Securities, upon delivery of corresponding Debentures to the Guarantor (or to such other person as directed 16
by the Guarantor) in exchange for New Debentures, the Guarantor shall mark or cause to be marked, on the Debentures so exchanged that such Debentures are being cancelled in exchange for New Debentures. In no event shall the Securities or Debentures be marked as paid. (u) The Guarantor and the Trust shall each use its reasonable best efforts if the Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Securities and continue to be rated immediately prior to the effective date of a Registration Statement, to confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, immediately following the effective date of such Registration Statement. (v) In the event that any Broker-Dealer shall underwrite any Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the NASD Rules) thereof in connection with an Underwritten Offering, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Guarantor and the Trust shall assist such Broker-Dealer in complying with the NASD Rules. (w) The Guarantor and the Trust shall use its best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration under the Act of the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement. 5. Registration Expenses. The Guarantor shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its and the Trust's obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof and, in the event of any Shelf Registration Statement in which any of the Initial Purchasers is named as a selling security holder, will reimburse such Initial Purchasers for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel (which shall initially be Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, but which may be another nationally recognized law firm experienced in securities matters designated by such Initial Purchasers) to act as counsel for such Initial Purchasers in connection therewith, and, in the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement at the time of filing of which any Initial Purchasers holds an unsold allotment, will reimburse the Initial Purchasers for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel acting in connection therewith. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Guarantor and the Trust, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement, each Initial Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer and each person who controls any such Holder, Initial Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Exchange Act or Section 20 of the Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or 17
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action; provided, however, that neither the Guarantor or the Trust will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (x) made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Guarantor by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein or (y) contained in any free writing prospectus used by an indemnified party without the prior written consent of the Guarantor; and provided further, that the Guarantor and the Trust shall not be liable to any Holder (or director, officer, employee, or agent of such Holder or any person controlling such Holder) with respect to any preliminary prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Holder results from the fact that such Holder sold Securities to a person as to whom it shall be established that there was not sent or given, at or prior to such sale, a copy of a later dated prospectus (including a free writing prospectus), if the Guarantor or the Trust had previously furnished copies thereof in sufficient quantity to such Holder and sufficiently in advance of such sale to allow for distribution by the date of such sale, and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Holder Initial Purchaser results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in or omitted from such initial prospectus, which was identified in writing at such time to such Holder and corrected in such later dated prospectus, and such correction would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability and provided further, that the Guarantor and the Trust shall not be liable to any Holder (or director, officer, employee, or agent of such Holder or any person controlling such Holder) and this indemnity and any reimbursement agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder (or director, officer, employee, or agent of such Holder or any person controlling such Holder) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased Securities or New Securities during a Deferral Period. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Guarantor and the Trust may otherwise have. The Guarantor and the Trust also agree, jointly and severally, in the case of Underwritten Offerings, to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof. (b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Guarantor, the Trust, each of the Guarantor's directors, each of the Guarantor's officers and each of the Trust's Administrative Trustees who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, and to reimburse them for expenses, in each case 18
to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity and reimbursement agreement from the Guarantor and the Trust to each such Holder, but only (i) with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Guarantor or the Trust by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity, (ii) with reference to any loss, claim, damage or liability arising out of or based upon any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact or alleged untrue statement or omission contained in a free writing prospectus used by such Holder without the prior written consent of the Guarantor and (iii) with reference to any loss, claim, damage or liability arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement contained in a prospectus that was used by a Holder during a Deferral Period. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of not more than one such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. 19
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the sale of securities which resulted in such Losses; provided, however, that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of securities which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Guarantor and the Trust shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement received by the Trust (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Guarantor or the Trust within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Guarantor or Administrative Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Guarantor and the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). (e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Guarantor, the Trust or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement. 7. Underwritten Registrations. (a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders. 20
(b) No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements. 8. Registration Defaults. If any of the following events shall occur, then (x) the Guarantor agrees that it shall pay the amounts described below as liquidated damages on the Debentures to the Holders thereof and (y) the Trust agrees that it shall pay corresponding amounts as liquidated damages on the then-outstanding Registrable Securities to the holders thereof (in each case, the "Registration Default Damages"): (a) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such filing in this Agreement, then Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Debentures at a rate of 0.25% per annum of the liquidation amount of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities until such filing occurs; (b) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date by which reasonable best efforts are to be used to cause such effectiveness under this Agreement, then commencing on the day after such specified date, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Debentures at a rate of 0.25% per annum of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities until such Registration Statement is declared effective; or (c) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective under this Agreement, then commencing on the day the Registration Statement ceases to be effective, Registration Default Damages shall accrue on the Debentures at a rate of 0.25% per annum of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities until such Registration Statement becomes effective or ceases to be required hereunder; provided, however, that (1) upon the filing of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (a) above), (2) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (in the case of paragraph (b) above), or (3) upon the effectiveness of the Registration Statement which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of paragraph (c) above), Registration Default Damages shall cease to accrue. The Registration Default Damages set forth in this Section 8 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to holders of Debentures or Securities as a consequence of the occurrence of any of the events described in paragraphs (a) through (c) above. 9. No Inconsistent Agreements. Neither the Guarantor nor the Trust has entered into, and each of the Guarantor and the Trust agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof. 21
10. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Guarantor and the Trust have obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities. 11. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, first-class mail, facsimile or courier guaranteeing overnight or same-day delivery: (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such holder to the Trust or the Guarantor in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11, which address initially is, with respect to each Holder, the address of such Holder maintained by the Registrar under the Trust Agreement; (b) if to the Representatives, initially at the address or addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and (c) if to the Guarantor or the Trust, initially at the addresses therefor as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when received. The Initial Purchasers, the Guarantor or the Trust by notice to the other parties may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. 12. Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns, including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the Guarantor or the Trust thereto, subsequent Holders and the indemnified persons referred to in Section 6 hereof. The Guarantor and the Trust each hereby agrees to extend the benefits of this Agreement to any Holder as if an original party hereto. 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 14. Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. 15. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York. The parties hereto each hereby waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement. 16. Severability. In the event that any one of more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in 22
any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of the parties shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 17. Securities Held by the Guarantor and the Trust, etc. Whenever the consent or approval of Holders of a specified percentage of principal amount of Securities or New Securities is required hereunder, Securities or New Securities, as applicable, held by the Guarantor, the Trust or their respective Affiliates (other than subsequent Holders of Securities or New Securities if such subsequent Holders are deemed to be Affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Securities or New Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval was given by the Holders of such required percentage. 23

ANNEX A Each broker-dealer that receives new securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such new securities. The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of new securities received in exchange for securities where such securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Guarantor and the Trust have agreed that, starting on the expiration date and ending on the close of business one year after the expiration date, they will make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution". A-1

ANNEX C PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION Each broker-dealer that receives new securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such new securities.

Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer and/or the purchasers of any such new securities. Any broker-dealer that resales new securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such new securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and any profit of any such resale of new securities and any commissions or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Act.
