(b) The Purchase Price shall also be adjusted prior to or after the Closing to reflect any agreement made by Purchaser and Shareholders pursuant to Section 5.8(h) of this Agreement with respect to the allocation of any Loss of Revenue (as such term is defined in Section 5.8(h)) among themselves.
Section 1.3
Adjustment of Purchase Price
(a) No later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Fimalac shall deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth the amount of Indebtedness expected to be outstanding as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"). The Estimated Closing Indebtedness shall include the amount of all interest, penalties, commissions, prepayment fees and other costs which will be payable in connection with the repayment of such Indebtedness in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5(a). The statement of Estimated Closing Indebtedness shall provide reasonable details, on an item by item basis, specifying the nature of each item of Indebtedness and the Company or the Subsidiary owing such Indebtedness, and shall include all statements from the banks and other relevant lenders set forth in Section 5.5(a) hereof. The statement of Estimated Closing Indebtedness shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as applied by the Company on a basis consistent with the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b) Within fifty (50) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Fimalac statements setting forth Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Cash Position") and the Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Working Capital"). For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Brand Transfer Consideration and the Closing Dividend shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the Closing Cash Position. The statement of Closing Cash Position shall include all bank statements and other records and documents supporting the calculation of the Closing Cash Position. The statement of Closing Net Working Capital shall be in the form of Exhibit A hereto (which for illustrative purposes only sets forth Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2004) and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, as applied by the Company on a basis consistent with the 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements.
(c) Fimalac and Purchaser shall have fifty (50) days after the delivery of the statements of Closing Cash Position and Closing Net Working Capital during which to review such statements and the Statement of Estimated Closing Indebtedness. Unless either Party notifies the other in writing within such fifty (50) day period of any good faith objection to any of such statements, specifying in reasonable detail the items and amounts subject to such objection (the "Disputed Items"), any of the statements to which no such objection shall have been so made shall be conclusive and binding on Shareholders and Purchaser. If, within such fifty (50) day period, a Party notifies the other in writing of any such objection, then the Parties shall use reasonable efforts for fifty (50) days after the expiration of such initial fifty (50) day period to resolve in good faith their differences and agree upon any adjustments to the statements of Closing Cash Position, Closing Net Working Capital and Estimated Closing Indebtedness, as the case may be. In the case of the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, such adjustments shall be those necessary to reflect the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date increased by the amount of all interest, penalties, commissions, prepayment fees and other costs which have been determined to be payable in connection with the reimbursement by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the Indebtedness on the first Business Day after the Closing Date as contemplated in Section 5.5(a) (such amount, the "Closing Indebtedness"). Any Disputed Items which are not resolved by the mutual agreement of Purchaser and Fimalac within such fifty (50) day period shall be submitted for resolution to an internationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm that may be mutually acceptable to Fimalac and Purchaser (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). If the Independent Accounting Firm shall have refused its mission and Fimalac and Purchaser shall not have succeeded within a ten (10) day period in naming a mutually acceptable replacement, either Party shall be entitled to request the designation of an Independent Accounting Firm by the President of the Commercial Court () of Paris. Fimalac and Purchaser shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to limit its examination to the unresolved Disputed Items, to resolve any such unresolved Disputed Items in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement for any such items (including, with respect to Indebtedness, the last sentence of 1.3(a)), and to use its best efforts to make its determination thereon within sixty (60) days after the referral of the Disputed Items to it in accordance herewith. The resolution of any such unresolved Disputed Items by such Independent Accounting firm shall be made in a writing delivered to Fimalac and Purchaser and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon Shareholders and Purchaser. The fees and expenses charged by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Parties in a manner that is proportionate to the final decision of the Independent Accounting Firm. For purposes of verifying the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash Position and the Closing Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall promptly provide such access as Fimalac, its accountants or the Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably require, (i) to the books, records and accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) to the personnel or accountants responsible for the finances and accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Any delay in providing such access shall toll the respective periods set forth above. For purposes of Section 1.4 hereof, the amounts agreed or determined following the procedures set forth in this Section shall constitute the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash Position and the Closing Net Working Capital. The amount corresponding to the Closing Indebtedness minus the Closing Cash Position shall constitute the Closing Net Indebtedness.

(d) The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of any net sale proceeds resulting from the sale of the Italian Lands, the Company or the selling Subsidiary receives such sales proceeds no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date (the "Additional Consideration"). For purposes of this purchase price adjustment, the amount of sale proceeds shall be calculated net of any Transfer Taxes, capital gain Taxes and other applicable Taxes and shall be reduced by the amount of any broker, finder or agent fee.

(a) On the Closing Date, for same day value, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Initial Purchase Price, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account notified by Seller to Purchaser (such notification to be made no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date).
(b) If the Closing Net Indebtedness is greater than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount corresponding to the difference between the Closing Net Indebtedness and the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, and if the Closing Net Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount corresponding to the difference between the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Net Indebtedness (each a "Net Indebtedness Adjustment").
(c) If the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than one hundred and thirty-two (132) million euros, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount corresponding to the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital and one hundred and thirty-two (132) million euros, and if the Closing Net Working Capital is less than one hundred and twenty-nine (129) million euros, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount corresponding to the difference between one hundred and twenty-nine (129) million euros and the Closing Net Working Capital (each a "Net Working Capital Adjustment").
(d) Any net amount required to be paid to Purchaser or to Seller, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 1.4(b) or Section 1.4(c) shall be paid in cash within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Closing Net Indebtedness and the Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with Section 1.3, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account designated by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date.
(e) If the Company or the relevant selling Subsidiary receives the Additional Consideration subsequent to the Closing and within the one hundred and eighty (180) day period following the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such Additional Consideration no later than ten (10) Business Days following receipt thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller pursuant to Section 1.4(a) or such other account as may be notified by Seller to Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days prior to the due date, and if the Company or the relevant selling Subsidiary receives the Additional Consideration prior to the Closing, such Additional Consideration shall be reflected in the Closing Cash Position, and shall not therefore give rise to any additional payment by Purchaser to Seller other than as set forth in Section 1.3(c).
(f) The amount set forth in Section 1.2(a)(vii) shall be calculated by Purchaser and notified to Fimalac on the first Business Day of the calendar month commencing after the date which is sixty (60) days after the Closing. If the proceeds referred to in Section 1.2(e)(vii) exceed the costs referred to in such Section 1.2(a)(vii) at the time of such calculation, then Purchaser shall promptly (in any case within three (3) Business Days following notification thereof) pay to Seller the amount of such excess. If such costs exceed such proceeds at the time of such calculation, then Seller shall promptly (and in any case within three (3) Business Days following notification thereof) pay to Purchaser the amount of such excess. In each case, payment shall be made in immediately available funds in pounds sterling to a bank account timely notified by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable. Seller's obligation to pay to Purchaser the amount of the costs referred to in Section 1.2(a)(vii) shall survive until payment in full of such costs to Purchaser and Purchaser's obligation to pay to Seller the amount of the sale proceeds referred to in Section 1.2(a)(vii) shall survive until payment in full of such proceeds to Seller. Accordingly, until such time as all such proceeds have been received or costs paid out, the amount set forth in Section 1.2(a)(vii) shall be calculated by Purchaser and notified to Fimalac on a quarterly basis (commencing with the calendar quarter ending after the first calculation date ) with respect to all such proceeds received or costs paid out subsequent to the most recent calculation date, and settlement payments shall be made in the manner set forth above.

FIMALAC INVESTISSEMENTS S.A.
By Name: Title:
     

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK) announced today that its offer to purchase Facom Tools from Fimalac, S.A. for 410 million (approximately $481 million) in cash has been presented to Facom's labor representatives for their opinions and such opinions have been rendered in accordance with French law. Further, all required antitrust reviews in Europe have been completed and related approvals secured.
New Britain, CT, December 7, 2005 
Fimalac has accepted Stanley's offer, and Stanley and Fimalac have entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement. The transaction is scheduled to close on January 1, 2006. As previously announced, the Facom acquisition is expected to be accretive to fully-diluted earnings by 10 per share in 2006.
(Note: Currency conversion is based on the December 7, 2005 mid-day rate of 1.1722, as published by The Federal Reserve Bank of New York.)
Separately, the company announced that it completed the acquisition of National Manufacturing Co. d/b/a National Hardware for $170 million cash on November 30, 2005, a month earlier than previously anticipated. As a result, National Hardware's financial results for the month of December will be included in Stanley's fourth quarter 2005 consolidated results of operations. It is anticipated that this will cause 2-3 per fully diluted share of earnings dilution  primarily associated with acquired inventory step-up charges  in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a corresponding increase in the previously announced accretion related to National Hardware expected in 2006, which is now expected to be 3-4 per fully diluted share.
The company also announced its decision to discontinue the operations of its small appliance hinge business and to divest its U.K. paint decorator tool business, both in the first half of 2006. These non-strategic businesses have combined annual sales approximating $40 million, 1% of the company's total annual sales. As a result, a charge to income primarily reflecting related asset impairments in the appliance hinge business, of approximately 3 per fully-diluted share will be included in continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2005. The operating profits of these businesses were negligible in 2005 and, as a consequence, their discontinuation and planned sale will have no meaningful impact on 2006 operating profitability.
As a result of these events, the company's fourth quarter and full year 2005 earnings guidance are reduced by the aforementioned 2-3 per fully-diluted share related to the timing of the National Hardware and by 3 related primarily to the appliance hinge business discontinuation. The company's previous 2006 earnings guidance is increased by the aforementioned 2-3 per fully diluted share related to the timing of the National Hardware acquisition.
John F. Lundgren, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The Facom Tools and National Hardware acquisitions are important steps toward strengthening our core Tools and Hardware franchises. We continue to be committed to maintaining a sharp focus on eliminating business activities which cannot meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations. The planned discontinuations of our small appliance hinge and U.K. paint decorator tools businesses are indicative of this commitment. Our ongoing portfolio transition has begun to provide considerable benefit. We plan to continue pursuing the shift in 2006 and beyond, with the goal of becoming a higher growth, diversified industrial company."
The Stanley Works, an S&P 500 company, is a worldwide supplier of consumer products, industrial tools and security solutions for professional, industrial and consumer use. More information about The Stanley Works, including corporate press releases, can be found at http://www.stanleyworks.com.
Statements in this press release, including those regarding (i) the scheduled closing of the Facom Tools transaction and the expectation that the Facom transaction will be accretive to fully diluted earnings by 10 cents per share in 2006; (ii) the expectation that the National Hardware acquisition will cause 2-3 cents per fully diluted share of earnings dilution in the fourth quarter and contribute 3-4 cents per fully diluted share in earnings accretion during 2006; (iii) the company's decision to discontinue its small appliance hinge business and to divest its European paint decorator tool businesses in the first half of 2006, its ability to limit the fourth quarter 2005 charge associated with these actions to approximately 3 cents per diluted share and its ability avoid any meaningful impact on 2006 operating profitability as a result of these planned actions (the "Results"), are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and other factors that could delay, divert, or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations.
The company's ability to close the Facom Tools transaction on January 1, 2006 and to deliver the Results is dependent upon, among other things, (i) satisfaction of the remaining conditions to closing the Facom transaction; (ii) the ability of the company to achieve the synergies anticipated as a result of the proposed acquisitions and limit acquisition-related costs and expenses within expected ranges; (iii) the ability of the company to minimize costs associated with the discontinuation of its small appliance hinge business; (iv) the ability of the company to divest its European paint decorator tool business in the first quarter of 2006 and minimize associated costs; (v) the success of the company's efforts to maintain prices in order to, among other things, offset the impact of steel and other commodity price inflation; (vi) continued improvements in productivity and cost reductions; and (vii) the absence or mitigation of increased pricing pressures from customers and competitors and the ability to defend market share in the face of price competition.
The company's ability to achieve the Results will also be affected by external factors including pricing pressure and other changes within competitive markets, the continued consolidation of customers particularly in consumer channels, inventory management pressures on the company's customers, increasing competition, changes in trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies and laws, inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, the impact of dollar/foreign currency exchange and interest rates on the competitiveness of products and the company's debt program, the strength of the U.S. economy and the impact of events that cause or may cause disruption in the company's installation, distribution and sales networks such as weather conditions, war, terrorist activities, political unrest and recessionary or expansive trends in the economies of the world in which the company operates.
The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date hereof.
