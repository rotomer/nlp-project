Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 13, 2006, The Stanley Works (the "Company") entered into a change of control severance agreement with Mr. Jeffrey D. Ansell (the "Executive Officer"). This agreement continues in effect for two years; provided, however, that on the first anniversary of the date above (and each anniversary thereafter) the term of the agreement will be extended for an additional year unless 90 days' advance notice is given not to extend the term. In addition, if a change in control (as defined in the agreement) occurs during the term, the term of the agreement will not expire earlier than two years from the date of the change of control. In order to receive benefits under this agreement, the Executive Officer must incur a qualifying termination of employment during the term of the agreement. A qualifying termination of employment will occur if the Executive Officer's employment is actually or constructively terminated (i) within two years following a change in control, (ii) in contemplation of a change in control or (iii) prior to a change in control at the direction of an entity or person who has entered into an agreement which if consummated would constitute a change in control. If the Executive Officer incurs a qualifying termination, he will be entitled to, among other things, (i) a payment equal to 2.5 times his annual base salary; (ii) a cash payment equal to 2.5 times his average annual bonus over the 3 years prior to termination; (iii) continuation of certain benefits and perquisites for 2.5 years (or, if shorter, until similar benefits are provided by the Executive Officer's new employer); and (iv) a payment reflecting the actuarial value of an additional 2.5 years of service credit for retirement pension accrual purposes under any defined benefit or contribution pension plans maintained by the Company. The Executive Officer will also be entitled to receive additional payments to the extent necessary to compensate him for any excise taxes payable by him under the federal laws applicable to excess pa rachute payments.
