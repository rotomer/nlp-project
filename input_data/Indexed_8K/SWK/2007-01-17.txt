     On January 16, 2007, The Stanley Works (the "Registrant") completed its previously announced purchase of HSM Electronic Protection Services, Inc. ("HSM") from SecurityCo Holdings, LLC. HSM provides security alarm monitoring services and access control systems to commercial customers.
The consideration consists of $545 million in cash which is subject to adjustment as follows: The purchase price will be reduced as to the amount of net indebtedness as of the acquisition's closing and will be increased or decreased to the extent that working capital has increased or decreased, respectively, as compared with HSM's normalized historical working capital target.
The Registrant financed the acquisition with proceeds from existing  short-term credit facilities and a new $500 million 364-day bridge facility entered into on January 8, 2007. The January 8, 2007 credit facility is described in greater detail in Registrant's Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 11, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Registrant remains committed to its current credit ratings and, as previously announced, intends to refinance this transaction with a combination of available cash, debt and equity-linked convertible debt, which it believes will be consistent with maintaining those ratings. The Registrant does not anticipate the need to issue common equity in the short term in order to achieve this objective.
The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto is incorporated herein in its entirety.
