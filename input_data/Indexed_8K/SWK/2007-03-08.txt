Mr. Lundgren commented: "Today a very capable and experienced management team updated Wall Street analysts and investors on the exciting growth and cost reduction initiatives that represent the heart of their day-to-day efforts. Along with a solid long-term strategy, brand and new product vitality and continued execution, the future is bright for the company and its investors."
