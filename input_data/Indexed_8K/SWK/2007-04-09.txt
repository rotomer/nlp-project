Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Stanley Works Provides Historical Results Reflecting New Segments Effective for 2007 Reporting Through 2006, the Company reported results in three segments: Consumer Products, Industrial Tools and Security Solutions. Due primarily to the January 16, 2007 acquisition of HSM Electronic Protection, Inc. ("HSM"), the Company announced it would realign to report three new segments effective with first quarter 2007 reporting: Construction and Do-It-Yourself ("CDIY"), Industrial and Security. These new segments more clearly convey the Company's growth strategies and reflect management's view of the Company's businesses with the inclusion of HSM. Today the Company is providing net sales, segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for the full years 2005 and 2006, as well as 2006 quarterly results, for these new segments. This information will enable comparison of future results with prior periods. There is no change to previously reported consolidated results. The new CDIY s egment includes hand tools, storage, fastening systems, and laser leveling & measuring tools, as these products are principally utilized in construction and by Do-It-Yourself customers. The new Industrial segment includes industrial and automotive repair tools (Facom, Mac, Proto and Supply & Service) and engineered solutions (Vidmar storage, hydraulics and assembly) businesses. The new Security segment includes mechanical access solutions (Best mechanical, automatic doors and hardware) and convergent security solutions (North America and U.K. systems integration and HSM monitoring). The hardware business is included in this segment due to its close marketing relationship with locking mechanisms and door closers such that all door-related products are now included within the Security segment. The Company is now presenting segment results before corporate overhead expenses, which are not allocated to the segments. In the past, reported segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales r eflected the allocation of approximately 150 bps of corporate expenses to each segment for the 2006 and 2005 periods.
