As amended July 20, 2007
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an Annual Meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary.
To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary of the date on which the proxy statement was first mailed relating to the immediately preceding Annual Meeting of shareholders; , that in the event that the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, in order for a shareholder's notice to be timely it must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which the notice of the date of such Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such Annual Meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an Annual Meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
provided, however
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the Annual Meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, including the complete text of any resolutions to be presented at the Annual Meeting with respect to such business, and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder of record proposing such business and any other person on whose behalf the proposal is being made, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder or such other person, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any such other person or persons in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder, (v) a description of any material interest of such shareholder or such other person in such business and (vi) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
No business shall be conducted at the Annual Meeting of shareholders except business brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4; , , that, once business has been properly brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 4 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an Annual Meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
provided
