FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Stanley Works Reports 3Q 2007 Results
Revenues Up 12%; EPS $1.09; Operating Margin Rate Reaches Record Levels
... The Stanley Works (NYSE: SWK) announced third quarter 2007 financial results today. Highlights are summarized below:
New Britain, Connecticut, October 24, 2007
Segment Results
Strong performances in Industrial and Security more than offset U.S. market-related issues in Construction & DIY (CDIY), as summarized in the following table:
John F. Lundgren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We were able to deliver solid earnings and cash flow results this quarter in spite of the challenging environment in U.S. CDIY. We continue to focus on reshaping our portfolio of businesses, as well as executing on new products, brand support, productivity and price/inflation recovery to bring about profitable growth.
"We are pleased with the status of acquisition integrations, as well as the stabilization of the legacy USSI business. Security Solutions attained the highest segment profit percentage in our portfolio and Bostitch (within the CDIY segment) continued to deliver solid progress toward better financial performance. We remain confident in our prospects for this year and beyond."
Management reaffirmed its previous estimates for 2007: the range of current year EPS expectations is $4.00-$4.05 per fully diluted share, an increase of 15-17% over 2006 earnings from continuing operations. The outlook for total sales growth is approximately 10%, including organic growth of 2%, based on anticipation of continued weak conditions in U.S. housing-related markets, which affect 25% of the company's total revenues. Free cash flow is expected to be $400-$450 million, consistent with prior guidance.
Fourth quarter 2007 total sales growth is expected at approximately 8%, with organic sales growth of about 2%. Net earnings are estimated at $1.10-$1.15 per fully diluted share, up 6%-11%, including an income tax rate of 24%-26% vs. 14% in 2006 resulting in a difference approximating $0.15  $0.18 per share in the quarter.
The company also announced that it recently completed two small strategic acquisitions that advance the ongoing positioning of its business portfolio toward growth markets:
These are both additions to the Mechanical Access portion of the Security segment. Combined annual revenues from these two acquisitions are expected to approximate $10 million and no significant impact on 2007 earnings is anticipated.
The company will host a conference call with investors at 10:00am EST, Wednesday, October 24, 2007 to discuss quarterly results. The call is accessible by telephone at (800) 267-8424 (domestic) and (706) 634-0695 (international) and via the Internet at www.stanleyworks.com by selecting "Investor Relations". A slide presentation to accompany the call will be available at www.stanleyworks.com and will remain available after the call. A replay will also be available two hours after the call and can be accessed at (800) 642-1687 using the conference identification number 20199629.
Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales less SG&A. Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level.
Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and capitalized software expenditures (reconciliation on pg. 8). Free cash flow does not reflect, among other things, deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the company's common stock and acquisitions. Organic sales growth is defined as total sales growth less sales of companies acquired in the past twelve months and less foreign currency impacts. The company believes these are important measures of its liquidity, of its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners, and of its sales performance.
