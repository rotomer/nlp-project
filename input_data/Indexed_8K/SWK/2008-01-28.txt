Mr. Lundgren added: "2008 promises to be an equally, if not more, challenging year from an end-market perspective. Fortunately, we are entering the year with our portfolio in excellent shape and with the majority of our businesses exhibiting strong momentum. We also are enjoying increasing operational benefits from the Stanley Fulfillment System, which is rapidly becoming a positive force within the company's culture."
Management reaffirmed its recent estimates for 2008
As previously announced, during the fourth quarter the company repurchased 2.0 million of its common shares in the open market for $100 million, an average price per share of $50.77. For the full year 2007, the company repurchased 3.7 million shares for $200 million. Further, today the company announced that, during January 2008, it repurchased an additional 2.2 million shares in the open market at an average price of $46.23 per share.
Mr. Lundgren added: "Our portfolio transformation strategy and our commitment to upper-tier credit ratings remain intact. In addition, periodic share repurchases and consistent dividend increases are important elements of the total return we deliver to shareholders. Our strong cash flows have afforded us the opportunity to repurchase nearly 6 million shares of our common stock in the past nine months. Our recent 10 million share repurchase authorization provides flexibility to buy additional shares in the future."

Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales less SG&A. Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level.
Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and capitalized software expenditures (reconciliation on pg. 8). Free cash flow does not reflect, among other things, deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the company's common stock and acquisitions. Organic sales growth is defined as total sales growth less sales of companies acquired in the past twelve months and less foreign currency impacts. The company believes these are important measures of its liquidity, of its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners, and of its sales performance.
