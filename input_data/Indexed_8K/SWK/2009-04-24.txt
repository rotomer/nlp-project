FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
The Stanley Works Reports 1Q 2009 Results
New Britain, Connecticut, April 24, 2009
...
The Stanley Works today announced first quarter 2009 financial results. Highlights are summarized below:
(NYSE: SWK)
John F. Lundgren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We took a number of strategic actions during the first quarter to reduce costs, strengthen our brands and invest for future growth. We believe that strong companies should find ways to grow market share and strengthen key franchises throughout the business cycle. Today's economic conditions afford us a unique opportunity to accelerate progress in these areas."
Segment Results:
James M. Loree, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer stated, "We anticipated that 2009 was going to start on a difficult note, but we experienced even greater volume pressure in both our Industrial and CDIY businesses. Our Security businesses held up well in weak economic conditions and our large recurring revenue base, strong market positions and the benefits from recent acquisitions allowed Security to post double-digit top line growth and to achieve robust operating profit margins."
The Company now believes there is sufficient visibility into various end markets and other factors to provide 2009 earnings and free cash flow guidance. Anticipating that current sales volume weakness will continue through the remainder of the year with smaller volume declines in the back half as comparisons become easier, management expects full year 2009 EPS to be in the range of $2.00  $2.50 and free cash flow of greater than $300 million based on the following assumptions:
Donald Allan Jr., Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Negative volume trends and the headwinds of unfavorable currency movements will impact our earnings potential this year, however, we have aligned the company's cost structure with the current economic environment and have positioned Stanley for growth as conditions improve. A major priority is to continue to build on the momentum we have created with the Stanley Fulfillment System to drive further improvements in working capital and to generate solid free cash flow."

The Company's ability to deliver the results as described above is based on current expectations and involves inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and other factors that could delay, divert, or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations. In addition to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in this press release, the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements include, without limitation, those set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and any material changes thereto set forth in any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, those contained in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and those set forth below.
The Company's ability to deliver the Results is dependent upon: (i) the Company's ability to implement the cost savings measures discussed in its December 11, 2008 press release and those announced in this press release within anticipated time frames and to limit associated costs; (ii) the Company's ability to limit restructuring charges in 2009 to $45 million; (iii) the Company's ability to limit unit volume declines to 13-15% relative to 2008 sales while maintaining or improving the existing product mix and geographic distribution; (iv) the Company's ability to successfully integrate recent acquisitions (including Sonitrol, Xmark, Scan Modul and GdP), as well as any future acquisitions, while limiting associated costs; (v) the success of the Company's efforts to expand its tools and security businesses; (vi) the success of the Company's efforts to build a growth platform and market leadership in Convergent Securities Solutions; (vii) the Company's success in developing and introducing new products, growing sales in existing markets and identifying and developing new markets for its products; (viii) the continued acceptance of technologies used in the Company's products, including Convergent Security Solutions products; (ix) the Company's ability to manage existing Sonitrol franchisee and Mac Tools distributor relationships; (x) the Company's ability to minimize costs associated with any sale or discontinuance of a business or product line, including any severance, restructuring, legal or other costs; (xi) the proceeds realized with respect to any business or product line disposals; (xii) the extent of any asset impairments with respect to any businesses or product lines that are sold or discontinued; (xiii)  the success of the Company's efforts to manage freight costs, steel and other commodity costs; (xiv) the Company's ability to sustain or increase prices in order to, among other things, offset or mitigate the impact of steel, freight, energy, non-ferrous commodity and other commodity costs and any inflation increases; (xv) the Company's ability to generate free cash flow and maintain a strong debt to capital ratio; (xvi) the Company's ability to identify and effectively execute productivity improvements and cost reductions, while minimizing any associated restructuring charges; (xvii) the Company's ability to obtain favorable settlement of routine tax audits; (xviii) the ability of the Company to generate earnings sufficient to realize future income tax benefits during periods when temporary differences become deductible; (xix) the continued ability of the Company to access credit markets under satisfactory terms; and (xx) the Company's ability to negotiate satisfactory payment terms under which the Company buys and sells goods, services, materials and products.
The Company's ability to deliver the Results is also dependent upon: (i) the success of the Company's marketing and sales efforts; (ii) the ability of the Company to maintain or improve production rates in the Company's manufacturing facilities, respond to significant changes in product demand and fulfill demand for new and existing products; (iii) the Company's ability to continue improvements in working capital; (iv) the ability to continue successfully managing and defending claims and litigation; (v) the success of the Company's efforts to mitigate any cost increases generated by, for example, increases in the cost of energy or significant Chinese Renminbi or other currency appreciation; and (vi) the geographic distribution of the Company's earnings.
The Company's ability to achieve the Results will also be affected by external factors. These external factors include: pricing pressure and other changes within competitive markets; the continued consolidation of customers particularly in consumer channels; inventory management pressures on the Company's customers; the impact the tightened credit markets may have on the Company or its customers or suppliers; the extent to which the Company has to write off accounts receivable or assets or experiences supply chain disruptions in connection with bankruptcy filings by customers or suppliers; increasing competition; changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect the Company, including, but not limited to trade, monetary, tax and fiscal policies and laws; the timing and extent of any inflation or deflation in 2009; currency exchange fluctuations; the impact of dollar/foreign currency exchange and interest rates on the competitiveness of products and the Company's debt program; the strength of the U.S. and European economies; the extent to which world-wide markets associated with homebuilding and remodeling continue to deteriorate; the impact of events that cause or may cause disruption in the Company's manufacturing, distribution and sales networks such as war, terrorist activities, and political unrest; and recessionary or expansive trends in the economies of the world in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the current recession in the US economy.
The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date hereof.

Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and capitalized software expenditures. The Company believes this is an important measure of its liquidity, of its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners. Free cash flow does not reflect, among other things, deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and acquisitions.
The change in working capital is comprised of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable.
