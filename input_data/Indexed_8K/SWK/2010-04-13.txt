(b) On April 7, 2010, M. Anthony Burns, a member of the Board of Directors of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (the "Company"), notified the Company that he will not stand for election at the Company's upcoming annual meeting of shareholders, which is scheduled to be held on May 20, 2010. Accordingly, Mr. Burns will cease to be a director thereafter. In a letter addressed to the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, Mr. Burns stated that "I have made the decision not to stand for election at the Stanley Black & Decker Annual Meeting. I have accepted the invitation to serve on a new Board and this additional commitment, along with my current Board and personal commitments, does not allow sufficient time to devote to the Stanley Black & Decker Board at this time." The Company wishes Mr. Burns the best in his other endeavors.
