Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
8. . (a) The Company and the Guarantor agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other U.S. federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(b) hereto, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that neither the Company nor
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
the Guarantor will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have.
(b) Each Underwriter severally, and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that the statements contained in the "Underwriting" section of any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (i) in the third paragraph of text, (ii) in the second sentence of the fourth paragraph of text and (iii) in the fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of text of such section constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
provided
however
 
indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement or an admission of fault, culpability by failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, Affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to
provided
however
 
contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company and the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and Guarantor, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
9. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Guarantor or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO.), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
TRANSFERS OF THIS GLOBAL SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS, IN WHOLE BUT NOT IN PART, TO NOMINEES OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY OR TO A SUCCESSOR THEREOF OR SUCH SUCCESSOR'S NOMINEE AND TRANSFERS OF PORTIONS OF THIS GLOBAL SECURITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO TRANSFERS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INDENTURE.]

STANLEY BLACK & DECKER, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut (herein referred to as the "Company", which terms includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to [CEDE & CO.]
*
, or its registered assigns, the principal sum [of                     ][set forth in Schedule I hereto]
*
on September 1, 2040 (the "Stated Maturity"), and to pay interest on said principal sum semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year commencing March 1, 2011 (each an "Interest Payment Date") at the rate of 5.20% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest on the Securities of this series will accrue from September 3, 2010 ("the Issue Date"), to the first Interest Payment Date, and thereafter will accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or the date of Stated Maturity is not a Business Day, then payment of interest, principal or premium, if any, payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or the date of Stated Maturity, as the case may be. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the February 15 or August 15, as the case may be (the "Regular Record Date"), immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, provided, however, that interest payable at Maturity will be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Company, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
The principal of and premium, if any, and each installment of interest on this Security, and registrations of transfers and exchanges, will be made at the office or agency of the Company in The City of New York provided that the payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the persons entitled thereto or by wire transfer to an account designated by the person entitled thereto; and provided further that so long as the Securities of this series are registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company or its nominee all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest in respect of this Security will be made in immediately available funds. Notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of this Security or the Indenture (as hereinafter defined) may be made at the office of the Trustee at The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 2 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1020, Chicago, IL 60602.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Any capitalized term which is used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Indenture.
 
 
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to below by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed in its name by Craig A. Douglas, the Vice President and Treasurer of the Company.
 
TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
Date:
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the "Securities"), designated as its 5.20% Notes due 2040, all issued and to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 1, 2002 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor trustee (the "Trustee") to JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 12, 2010 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 3, 2010 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture," and, together with the Second Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, The Black & Decker Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Guarantor"), and the Trustee, creating such issue and to which reference is made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
General Provisions
The provisions for defeasance of the entire Indebtedness of this Security upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture shall apply to the Securities.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof by supplemental indenture and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture by the Company (when authorized by or pursuant to a Board Resolution), the Guarantor and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the securities of all series then Outstanding to waive compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor on in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series
 
at the time Outstanding in respect of which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof, any premium, or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
The Securities of this issue are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this issue are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this issue and of like tenor and of authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
The Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the Guarantor or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
This Security is guaranteed by the Guarantor as set forth in the Indenture.
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Optional Redemption

For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions are applicable:
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (A) the arithmetic average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the arithmetic average of all such quotations for such redemption date.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee after consultation with us; provided, that if such Reference Treasury Dealer ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, we will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.

Morgan Securities LLC, and UBS Securities LLC; provided, that if any of the foregoing dealers shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the arithmetic average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m. New York City time on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
Interest shall cease to accrue on the Securities, or any portion thereof called for redemption, on and after the redemption date for the Securities, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price. The Company, on or before the redemption date for the Securities, shall deposit with a paying agent, or the Trustee, funds sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities to be redeemed on such date. If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.

The Securities shall not be convertible into shares of Common Stock and/or exchangeable for other securities.

principal amount of its Securities outstanding after a repurchase in part shall be $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company shall mail a notice to the Holders describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Securities on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the procedures and described in such notice.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Securities, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflicts.
On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor or determine whether or not a Change of Control Triggering Event (or any of its components) has occurred.

equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
(c)     we do not express any opinion as to the applicability or effect of any fraudulent transfer, preference or similar law on any of the Transaction Documents or any transactions contemplated thereby; and
(d)     to the extent any opinion relates to the enforceability of the choice of New York law and choice of New York forum provisions of the Transaction Documents, our opinion is rendered in reliance upon N.Y.

C.P.L.R. 327(b) (McKinney 2001) and is subject to the qualification that such enforceability may be limited by public policy or constitutional considerations.
Our opinions set forth herein are limited to those laws of the State of New York that, in our experience, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Registration Statement and, to the extent that judicial or regulatory orders or decrees or consents, approvals, licenses, authorizations, validations, filings, recordings or registrations with governmental authorities are relevant, to those required under such laws (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Opined-on Law"). We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined-on Law or as to the effect of any such non-Opined-on Law on the opinions herein stated.
Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
