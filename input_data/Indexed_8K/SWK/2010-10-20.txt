FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Stanley Black & Decker Reports 3Q 2010 Results
New Britain, Connecticut, October 20th, 2010
...
Stanley Black & Decker today announced third quarter 2010 financial results.
(NYSE: SWK)
Net sales for the period were $2.4 billion, up 153% versus prior year due to the inclusion of Black & Decker's results (+139%), unit volume (+7%), other acquisitions (+9%) and currency (-2%). On a pro forma basis, legacy Black & Decker also achieved strong unit volume growth of 10%.
The gross margin rate, excluding one-time charges, was 36.9%, relatively flat to the pro forma 3Q'09 rate. The impact of modest commodity inflation, foreign exchange and unfavorable mix was partially offset by productivity projects and synergy realization.
Working capital turns for the quarter were 4.6. 3Q'10 free cash flow was $234 million, excluding $81 million of merger-related one-time payments.
SG&A expenses, excluding one-time charges, were 24.3% of sales, down from a 3Q'09 combined company pro forma level of 25.3% as a result of volume leverage and cost synergy realization.
Stanley Black & Decker's President and CEO, John F. Lundgren commented, "We are very pleased with the organic revenue growth achieved across many of our businesses in the third quarter, which was driven by the launch of a number of successful new products and the impact of our commitment to outstanding customer service. The integration of Stanley Black & Decker is proceeding ahead of plan and based on our execution and experience to date, we now expect to realize $125 million in cost synergies in 2010, $35 million more than originally forecast. In addition, as we continue to analyze the revenue synergy potential for the combined company we have reason to believe that execution of these initiatives will drive significant additional top-line growth in the coming years."
3Q'10 Segment Results
(Excludes One-Time Charges)
The company has included below a pro forma discussion comparing 3Q'10 to prior year for the legacy Black & Decker businesses in order to assist with the understanding of the company on a combined basis:
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, James M. Loree, commented, "Our second full quarter as a combined company was characterized by organizational agility and global teamwork, thus enabling accelerated cost synergy realization and, as importantly, a strong organic growth performance. We are harnessing the power of our new global footprint to pursue aggressive growth strategies in higher growth, developing regions such as Latin America and Asia. At the same time, we are introducing exciting and innovative new products across the globe in our major businesses. In addition, while we continue to identify and evaluate significant revenue synergy opportunities for funding and execution in 2011 and beyond, our business and regional teams have already begun to implement quick hits which, although difficult to quantify, clearly contributed to strong 3Q organic growth. This array of top line drivers along with our early integration wins has served to mobilize the organization around the theme of profitable growth which, in turn, has accelerated the cultural assimilation which is so important to a successful integration."
One-Time Charges
A non-cash inventory step-up charge of $13 million along with $7 million of facility closure-related charges were reported in gross margin during the quarter.  One-time costs recorded in SG&A and Other, net were both $8 million for integration-related consulting fees and deal costs, respectively. Merger-related restructuring charges and asset impairments, primarily associated with planned facility closures and the severance of employees, totaled $22 million in 3Q'10.
2010 Outlook
The company is increasing its 2010 full year EPS guidance from the prior range of $3.35  $3.55 to a range of $3.60  $3.70, which excludes the $0.21 positive 2Q tax-related benefit and the impact of one-time charges.
Free cash flow, excluding one-time charges and payments, is now expected to exceed $700 million for 2010, an increase from previous commentary stating that the number would exceed $600 million.
Donald Allan Jr, Senior Vice President and CFO commented, "We were pleased to be able to raise our full year 2010 EPS guidance range based primarily on our ability to realize certain cost synergies faster than anticipated. While it is likely we will exceed our previously announced target of $350 million in cost synergies, we are in the process of refining this estimate as well as the extent to which such outperformance will be reinvested in growth synergy projects. Thus, it is our intent to provide an updated estimate in connection with our 4Q'10 earnings release in January. Our forecast for top line growth of 5% in the second half of 2010 takes into account that the sales momentum generated by our new products in the market for the remainder of the year will be partially offset by normal fourth quarter seasonality within our CDIY business in particular and tougher pro forma prior year comparisons."

Organic sales growth is defined as total sales growth less sales of companies acquired in the past twelve months and less foreign currency impacts. Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales less SG&A.  Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. The normalized statement of operations and business segment information, as reconciled to GAAP on pages 8-9 and 13-14, is considered relevant to aid analysis of the company's margin and earnings results aside from the material impact of the one-time charges associated with the Black & Decker merger.
Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures.  Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners.  Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items.   Normalized cash flow and free cash flow, as reconciled to the associated GAAP measures on pages 11 and 12, are considered meaningful pro forma metrics to aid the understanding of the company's cash flow performance aside from the material impact of the Black & Decker merger-related payments and charges.   
The term "pro forma" is used to describe the company's results as if Black & Decker had been included in 2009, rather than from the March 12, 2010 merger date.  Such pro forma amounts and measures are provided to facilitate understanding the company's performance due to the significance of the merger with Black & Decker.  These pro forma measures do not include the effects of any of the other acquisitions such as CRC Evans acquired in July 2010.
