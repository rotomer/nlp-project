indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.

Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of no more than one such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement or an admission of fault, culpability by failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

however
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate

to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.

In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

Final term sheet dated November 1, 2010
 
 
Exhibit A
1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, to the extent that such execution and delivery are governed by New York law.
2. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, to the extent that such execution and delivery are governed by New York law, and the Indenture is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
3. The Global Certificates and the Global Note have been duly executed by the Company, to the extent such execution is governed by New York law, and when (i) the Notes are duly authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (ii) the Corporate Units are authenticated by the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, and (iii) the Convertible Preferred Units are issued and delivered by the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Notes and the Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
4. No Governmental Approval, which has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required for the execution or delivery by the Company of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby.
5. The statements in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Underwriting," insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
6. The statements in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of the Convertible Preferred Units", "Description of the Purchase Contracts", "Certain Provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement", "Description of the Notes" and "Description of the Capped Call Transactions" in so far as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Purchase Contracts, the Pledge Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.
7. Under current United States federal income tax law, although the discussion set forth in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Convertible Preferred Units (including components thereof), the convertible preferred stock acquired under a purchase contract and the common stock acquired upon
 
conversion of the convertible preferred stock, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Convertible Preferred Units (including components thereof), the convertible preferred stock acquired under a purchase contract and the common stock acquired upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock.
8. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Convertible Preferred Units and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
9. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Convertible Preferred Units, will not violate or conflict with, or result in any contravention of, any Applicable Law.
10. (i) the Registration Statement, at the time of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for purposes of Section 11 of the Act (the "Effective Time"), and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 (the "Form T-1")); and (ii) no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the Registration Statement, at the Effective Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1). In addition, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that we do not express any view as to the financial statements, schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom or the statements contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1).

The shares of Convertible Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Contracts have been duly authorized and reserved and, when issued and paid for upon exercise of the Purchase Contracts in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contracts, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any preemptive rights or any similar rights arising under Connecticut law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any Applicable Contract.
10. The shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment ("Conversion Shares") have been duly authorized and reserved by all necessary corporate action and, when issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and free and clear of any preemptive rights or any or similar rights arising under Connecticut law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any Applicable Contract.
11. The statements in the General Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Capital Stock" and "Description of the Convertible Preferred Stock" in so far as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Certificate of Amendment fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects.

The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the issuance and sale of the Securities will not (i) conflict with the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, (ii) constitute a violation of, or a breach or default under, the terms of any Applicable Contract or (iii) violate or conflict with, or result in any contravention of, any Applicable Law, except, in the case of (ii) and (iii), for such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or contraventions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, likely result in a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. I do not express any opinion, however, as to whether the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will constitute a violation of, or a default under, any covenant, restriction or provision with respect to financial ratios or tests or any aspect of the financial condition or results of operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
13. No Governmental Approval that has not been obtained or taken and is not in full force and effect, is required to authorize, or is required for, the execution or delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby.
14. To my knowledge, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any Designated Subsidiary is a party, or to which any property of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary is subject, that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the condition, financial or otherwise, or earnings or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, except as set forth in, incorporated by reference in, or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).

(9). . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation for any of the following events that occur following November 5, 2010 (regardless of whether any Convertible Preferred Stock has been issued at the time of any such event):
Conversion Rate Adjustments
(a) If the Corporation issues Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on its Common Stock to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
where:
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such share split or share combination;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately on and after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination; and
OS
1
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination.
Any adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall become effective as of the open of business on (x) the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution or (y) the date on which such split or combination becomes effective, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution described in this paragraph (a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(b) If the Corporation distributes to all holders of Common Stock any rights, warrants or options entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days after the date of distribution thereof to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, in any case at an exercise price per share of Common Stock less than the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the time of announcement of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately on and after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
X = the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, warrants or options; and
Y = the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the aggregate price payable to exercise all such rights, warrants or options and (B) the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for the distribution of such rights, warrants or options.
 
 
For purposes of this paragraph (b), in determining whether any rights, warrants or options entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock at less than the applicable Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock, and in determining the aggregate exercise or conversion price payable for such Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Corporation for such rights, warrants or options and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Corporation. Any increase to the Conversion Rate made under this paragraph (b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance. If any right, warrant or option described in this paragraph (b) is not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such right, warrant or option had not been so issued.
(c) If the Corporation distributes shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness or other assets or property of the Corporation to all holders of Common Stock, excluding:
(i) dividends, distributions, rights, warrants or options as to which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate was effected in paragraph (a) or (b) above;
(ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash; and
(iii) Spin-Offs described below in this paragraph (c), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately on and after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
SP
0
= the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and
FMV = the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of the shares of Capital Stock of the Corporation, evidences of indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock, expressed as an amount per share of Common Stock, on the earlier of the Record Date and the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
 
 
An adjustment to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall become effective as of the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
If any such distribution is declared or not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared. If any such distribution consists of rights, warrants or options, and such rights, warrants or options are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such right, warrant or option had not been so issued.
If the Corporation distributes to all holders of Common Stock, Capital Stock of the Corporation of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately following the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall be increased based on the following formula:

) / MP
0
where:
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate immediately after the 10th Trading Day immediately following (and including) the effective date of the Spin-Off;
FMV
0
= the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the capital stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Days after and including the effective date of the Spin-Off; and
MP
0
= the average of the Closing Sale Prices of Common Stock over the first 10 consecutive Trading Days after (and including) the Ex-Dividend Date of the Spin-Off.
An adjustment to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph will occur at the close of business on the 10th Trading Day from and including the effective date of the Spin-Off; provided that in respect of any Conversion Date that occurs within the 10 Trading Days following the effective date of any Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to 10 consecutive Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the effective date of such Spin-Off to and including the applicable Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate adjustment for such conversion.
If any such dividend or distribution described in this paragraph (c) is declared but not paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
 
(d) If any regular, quarterly cash dividend or distribution made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period exceeds $0.34 per share (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Initial Dividend Threshold

= CR
0
 (SP

0
 C)
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution;
SP
0
= the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution;
C = the amount in cash per share the Corporation distributes to holders of Common Stock; and
IDT = the Initial Dividend Threshold.
If C is greater than or equal to SP
0
, then, in lieu of any adjustment under this paragraph (d), the Corporation shall make adequate provision so that each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution.
The Initial Dividend Threshold is subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate, provided that no adjustment will be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate under this paragraph (d).
(e) If the Corporation pays any cash dividend or distribution that is not a regular, quarterly cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
CR
1
= CR
0
 SP
0
/ (SP
0
 C)
where,
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;
 
 
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect on and after the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;
SP
0
= the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; and
C = the amount in cash per share the Corporation distributes to holders of Common Stock.
If C is greater than or equal to SP
0
, then, in lieu of any adjustment under this paragraph (e), the Corporation shall make adequate provision so that each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the right to receive upon conversion for each share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect as of the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution.
An adjustment to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to Section 3B(9)(d) or Section 3B(9)(e) shall become effective as of the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. If any dividend or distribution described in Section 3B(9)(d) or Section 3B(9)(e) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(f) If the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
CR
1
= CR
0
 (AC + (SP
1
 OS
1
)) / (SP
1
 OS
0
)
where:
CR
0
= the Conversion Rate in effect on the Trading Day on which such tender or exchange offer expires;
CR
1
= the Conversion Rate in effect on the Trading Day immediately following the date such tender or exchange offer expires;
AC = the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) paid or payable for the Common Stock purchased in such tender or exchange offer;
OS
0
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires (prior to giving effect to the purchase or exchange of shares of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer);
 
 
OS
1
= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to the purchase or exchange of shares of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer); and
SP
1
= the Closing Sale Price of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires.
If the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made.
Any adjustment to the Conversion Rate made pursuant to this Section 3B(9)(f) shall become effective on the second day immediately following the date such tender offer or exchange offer expires. If the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries is obligated to purchase Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer but is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchase or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
(g) The Corporation may make such increases to the Conversion Rate in addition to those required by this Section 3B(9) as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to purchase Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors determines in good faith that such increase would be in the best interests of the Corporation. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of the Convertible Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as it appears in the stock register a notice of the reduction at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(i) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Rate then in effect, , that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 3B(9)(g)(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such carried forward adjustments shall be made on the Conversion Date with respect to any converted shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than one percent on the Conversion Date. All calculations under this Section 3B(9) shall be made by the Corporation and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.
provided, however
(ii) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made if holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock, as a result of holding the Convertible Preferred
 
Stock and without conversion thereof, are entitled to participate at the same time as the holders of Common Stock participate in any of the transactions described above as if such holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock held a number shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, by the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holders.
multiplied
(iii) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation shall promptly file with the Conversion Agent an Officer's certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a responsible officer of the Conversion Agent shall have received such Officer's certificate, the Conversion Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Corporation shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each holder of Convertible Preferred Stock at its last address appearing in the stock register within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(iv) If a Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective on the Ex-Dividend Date for any dividend or distribution and a holder that has converted its shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or prior to the related Record Date would be treated as the record holder of Common Stock as of the related Conversion Date based on an adjusted Conversion Rate for such Ex-Dividend date, then, notwithstanding the foregoing Conversion Rate adjustment provisions, adjustments relating to such Ex-Dividend Date will not be made for such converting holder. Instead, such holder will be treated as if such holder were the record owner of Common Stock on an unadjusted basis and participate in the related dividend, distribution or other event giving rise to such adjustment.
(v) For purposes of this Section 3B(9), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation, unless such treasury shares participate in any distribution or dividend that requires an adjustment pursuant to this Section 3B(9), but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
(h) Whenever any provision of this Section 3B(9) requires the Corporation to calculate the Closing Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Conversion Values or the Daily Settlement Amounts over a span of multiple days (including any Observation Period), the Corporation shall make appropriate adjustments to each to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period when the Closing Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Conversion Values or the Daily Settlement Amounts are to be calculated.
 
 
(a) If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Corporation, (iii) any sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Corporation to any other Person, or (iv) any statutory share exchange, in each case, as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") upon such transaction; however, that at and after the effective time of the transaction (i) the Corporation shall continue to have the right to determine the form of consideration to be paid and delivered, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3B(7)(d) and (ii) (x) any amount payable in cash upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3B(7)(d) shall continue to be payable in cash, (y) any shares of Common Stock that the Corporation would have been required to deliver upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3B(7)(d) shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a holder of that number of shares of Common Stock would have been entitled to receive in such transaction and (z) the Daily VWAP shall be calculated based on the value of a unit of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would have received in such transaction.
Reference Property
provided,
(b) If the holders of Common Stock receive only cash in such transaction, then notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary for all conversions that occur after the effective date of such transaction (i) the consideration due upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be solely cash in an amount equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date (as may be increased by any Fundamental Change Make-Whole Premium), by the price paid per share of Common Stock in such transaction and (ii) the Corporation shall satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash to converting holders of Convertible Preferred Stock on the third Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the Conversion Date.
multiplied
(c) If the transaction causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), then for the purposes of this Section 3B(10), the Reference Property shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration so receivable received per share by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such election.
 
 
(d) In connection with any adjustment to the Conversion Rate provided under Section 3B(9), the Corporation shall also adjust the Initial Dividend Threshold under Section 3B(9)(d) based on the number of shares of Common Stock comprising the Reference Property and (if applicable) the value of any non-stock consideration comprising the Reference Property. If the Reference Property is composed solely of non-stock consideration, the Initial Dividend Threshold shall be zero.
(e) The Corporation shall cause notice of the application of this Section 3B(10) to be delivered to each holder of the Convertible Preferred Stock at the address of such holder as it appears in the stock register within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 3B(10)(a) and shall issue a press release containing such information and publish such information on its web site on the World Wide Web. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any conversion right pursuant to this Section 3B(10).
(f) The above provisions of this Section 3B(10) shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances, and the provisions of Section 3B(9) shall apply to any shares of Capital Stock received by the holders of Common Stock in any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance; that if this Section 3B(10) applies to any event or occurrence, Section 3B(9) shall not apply to such event or occurrence.
provided
(11). . If the Corporation has in effect a rights plan while any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding, holders of Convertible Preferred Stock shall receive, upon a conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock, in addition to shares of Common Stock, rights under the Corporation's shareholder rights agreement unless, prior to such conversion, the rights have expired, terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common Stock. If the rights provided for in the shareholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement so that holders of Convertible Preferred Stock would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of the Common Stock, if any, that the Corporation is required to deliver upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation had distributed to all holders of the Common Stock, Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock), evidences of indebtedness, the Corporation's assets or properties pursuant to Section 3B(9)(c) above, subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.

Nor shall holders of Convertible Preferred Stock have any voting right with respect to, and the consent of the holders of any Convertible Preferred Stock is not required for, any corporate action, including any merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, regardless of the effect that such merger, consolidation or sale may have upon the powers, preferences, voting power or other rights or privileges of Convertible Preferred Stock, except as set forth above.
In addition, the voting power as provided above shall not apply, if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which the vote would otherwise be required would occur, the Corporation has converted or redeemed upon proper procedures all outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
(c) If at any time dividends on any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, then the holders of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (voting together as a class with all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect two additional directors of the Corporation (each, a "") at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or at a special meeting of the Corporation's stockholders called for such purpose, whichever is earlier) and each subsequent meeting until all dividends accumulated on the Convertible Preferred Stock and all other series of Parity Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable have been fully paid or a sum sufficient for payment is set aside for payment. In such a case, the number of directors serving on the Board of Directors shall be increased by two. The term of office of such Convertible Preferred Stock Directors will terminate immediately upon the termination of the right of
Convertible Preferred Stock Director

(i) The Company will separately pay the Remarketing Fee to the Remarketing Agent(s) for its service in connection with any Successful Remarketing. Holders whose Notes are remarketed will not be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee.

On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, an amount equal to the Purchase Price for all related Purchase Contracts shall be remitted to the Company as payment of such Holder's Obligations under such Purchase Contracts without receiving any instructions from the Holder.

If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) have in effect a Registration Statement covering the Convertible Preferred Stock to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (y) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Fundamental Change Early Settlement (it being understood that if there is a material business transaction or development that has not yet been publicly disclosed, the Company will not be required to provide such a Prospectus, and the right to effect Fundamental Change Early Settlement will not be available, until the Company has publicly disclosed such transaction or development, provided that the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to make such disclosure as soon as it is commercially reasonable to do so).

In addition, the Company shall provide each Holder and the Purchase Contract Agent with notice of a Fundamental Change within five Business Days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change, which shall specify, in addition to all of the information contained in the Fundamental Change Company Notice (as if shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding on the date of such notice), the date on which such Fundamental Change Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be at least ten Business Days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change but no later than the earliest of (x) 20 Business Days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change and (y) (i) one Business Day prior to the first day of the commencement of a Triggered Early Remarketing Period, (ii) one Business Day prior to the first day of the commencement of an Optional Remarketing Period, or, if the Company has not specified an Optional Remarketing Period or the Optional Remarketing is not successful, (iii) the commencement of the Final Remarketing Period or, if the Final Remarketing is not successful, (iv) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (such date, the ""), the consideration receivable by the Holder, including the amount of Contract Adjustment Payments receivable, upon settlement.

As provided in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing or a Failed Triggered Early Remarketing, as applicable, as of the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable, each Holder of any Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to the Notes and to have elected to apply the Proceeds of the Put Right equal to the aggregate Purchase Price against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contracts in full satisfaction of such Holder's Obligations under such Purchase Contracts.
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holder thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall terminate if a Termination Event shall occur.

The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph.
The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts forming part of the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the
 
event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contracts, consents to the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes and the underlying Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio), as the case may be, underlying this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Purchase Contracts.

Section 7.01
. Remarketing Procedures.
(a) In the case of an Optional Remarketing, unless a Termination Event or a Trigger Event has occurred prior to the Optional Remarketing Period; or in the case of a Final Remarketing, unless a Successful Optional Remarketing, a Triggered Early Settlement or a Termination Event has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Period; or in the case of a Triggered Early Remarketing, if a Trigger Event has occurred prior to the first day in the Optional Remarketing Window, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent(s) pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for the Remarketing of the Notes. The Company shall, no later than (i) in the case of an Optional Remarketing, fifteen days prior to the first day of the Optional Remarketing Period, (ii) in the case of a Final Remarketing, the later of October 21, 2015 and the Business Day following the last day of any Optional Remarketing Period ending on or prior to October 23, 2015 or (iii) in the case of a Triggered Early Remarketing Event, fifteen calendar days prior to the first day of the Triggered Early Remarketing Period, request that the Depositary or its nominee notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Separate Notes, Corporate Units and Treasury Units, and shall provide a copy of such request to the Collateral Agent and the Purchase Contract Agent, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, of the Company's intent to attempt an Optional Remarketing in the Applicable Remarketing Period, and in all cases, of the proposed Remarketing Dates and the procedures to be followed in each Remarketing, including the procedures to be followed by Holders of Separate Notes to participate in a Remarketing, the applicable procedures for Holders of Corporate Units to create Treasury Units or Holders of Treasury Units to recreate Corporate Units, as the case may be, the applicable procedures for Holders of
 
Corporate Units to effect an Early Settlement and, in the case of a Final Remarketing or a Triggered Early Remarketing, applicable procedures for Holders of Corporate Units to create Cash Settled Units and the applicable procedures that must be followed by a Holder of Separate Notes if such Holder wishes to exercise its Put Right or by a Holder if such Holder elects not to exercise its Put Right.
(b) At any time prior to a Remarketing, other than during a Blackout Period, each Holder of Separate Notes may elect to have Separate Notes held by such Holder remarketed in any Remarketing. A Holder making such an election must, pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, notify the Custodial Agent and deliver such Separate Notes to the Custodial Agent in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement. Any such notice and delivery may not be conditioned upon the level at which the Reset Rate is established in the Remarketing. Any such notice and delivery may be withdrawn by notifying the Custodial Agent on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding an Optional Remarketing Period, a Triggered Early Remarketing Period or the Final Marketing Period, as applicable. Any such notice and delivery not withdrawn by such time will be irrevocable with respect to each Remarketing to occur during the Optional Remarketing Period. Pursuant to Section 5.02 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, in the case of an Optional Remarketing, or promptly after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of a Final Remarketing or a Triggered Early Remarketing, on the Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the Applicable Remarketing Period, the Custodial Agent, based on the notices and deliveries received by it prior to such time, shall notify the Remarketing Agent(s) of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Notes tendered for Remarketing. Pursuant and subject to Section 5.02 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, Notes that underlie Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes included in Corporate Units will be deemed tendered for Remarketing and will be remarketed in accordance with the terms of the Remarketing Agreement and the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
(c) The right of each Holder of Remarketed Notes to have such Notes remarketed and sold on any Remarketing Date shall be subject to the conditions that (i)(A) the Remarketing Agent(s) conducts any Optional Remarketing or (B) in the case of a Final Remarketing, that no Successful Optional Remarketing or Triggered Early Settlement Date has occurred pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, (ii) a Termination Event has not occurred prior to such Remarketing Date, (iii) the Remarketing Agent(s) are able to find a purchaser or purchasers for Remarketed Notes at the Remarketing Price based on the Reset Rate and (iv) the purchaser or purchasers of the Remarketed Notes deliver the purchase price therefor to the Remarketing Agent(s) as and when required.
 
 
(d) None of the Trustee, the Company nor the Remarketing Agent(s) shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment upon tender of Notes for remarketing.
Section 7.02Unless a Termination Event has occurred prior to such date, if the Company elects to conduct an Optional Remarketing during an Optional Remarketing Period selected by the Company pursuant to the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement, the Remarketing Agent(s) shall use its reasonable best efforts to remarket the Remarketed Notes at the applicable Remarketing Price.
. Remarketing.
(a) In the case there is no Successful Optional Remarketing during an Optional Remarketing Period, either because the Remarketing Agent(s) is unable to remarket the Notes at the applicable Remarketing Price or because a condition precedent to the Remarketing has not been satisfied, and unless a Termination Event has occurred prior to such date, during the Triggered Early Remarketing Period or the Final Remarketing Period, as applicable, the Remarketing Agent(s) shall use its reasonable best efforts to remarket the Remarketed Notes at the applicable Remarketing Price. The Remarketing on any Remarketing Date will be considered successful if the resulting proceeds are at least equal to the applicable Remarketing Price. The Company has the right to postpone the Final Remarketing or the Triggered Early Remarketing, as applicable, in the Company's absolute discretion on any day prior to the last three Business Days of the Final Remarketing Period or the Triggered Early Remarketing Period, as applicable.
Section 7.03
. Reset Rate.
(a) In connection with each Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent(s) shall determine the Reset Rate in consultation with the Company (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of one percent (0.00001) per annum).
(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Reset Rate shall in no event exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and shall not be a floating rate or a contingent rate.
(c) In the event of a Successful Remarketing, the Interest Rate shall be reset on the Remarketing Settlement Date to the Reset Rate as determined by the Remarketing Agent(s) under the Remarketing Agreement, and the Company shall (i) notify the Trustee by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee and (ii) request the Depositary to notify its Depositary Participants holding Notes, in each case, of the Reset Rate, Interest Payment Dates, ranking and any other modified terms established for the Notes during the Remarketing on the Business Day following the date of the Successful Remarketing.
(d) In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, a Failed Triggered Early Remarketing, or if no Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes are included in
 
Corporate Units and none of the Holders of the Separate Notes elect to have their Notes remarketed in any Remarketing, the applicable interest rate on the Notes will not be reset and will continue to be the Interest Rate.
(e) If there is a Failed Remarketing, the Company shall cause a notice of the unsuccessful Remarketing to be published before 9:00 a.m., New York City time on the Business Day following the Applicable Remarketing Period. This notice shall be validly published by making a timely release to any appropriate news agency, including, without limitation, Bloomberg Business News and the Dow Jones News Service.
Section 7.04
. Put Right.
(a) Subject to Section 7.04(b) below, if there has not been a Successful Remarketing prior to the last day of the Final Remarketing Period or a Triggered Early Remarketing Period, as applicable, Holders of Notes will, subject to this Section 7.04, have the right (the "") to require the Company to purchase such Notes for cash on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable, at a price per Note to be purchased equal to the principal amount of the applicable Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon (including all accrued and unpaid Deferred Interest, if any, and Compounded Interest thereon, but excluding all accrued but unpaid Deferred Interest, if any, and Compounded Interest thereon which is to be paid in cash, or, in the case of a Failed Triggered Early Remarketing, cash or Deferral Securities at the Company's election on the Triggered Early Settlement Date) to, but excluding, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable (the "").
Put Right
Put Price
(b) The Put Right of Holders of Applicable Ownership Interests in Notes that are part of Corporate Units will be deemed to be automatically exercised, in whole but not in part, in accordance with Section 5.02 of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement.
(c) The Put Right of a Holder of a Separate Note shall only be exercisable upon delivery of a notice substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B hereto, together with such Holder's Separate Notes, to the Trustee by such Holder at or prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable. Such Put Right for a Holder of a Separate Note may be exercised with respect to all or a portion of such Holder's Separate Notes (so long as such portion is an integral multiple of $1,000 principal amount). On or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate Put Price of all Separate Notes with respect to which a Holder has exercised a Put Right. In exchange for any Separate Notes surrendered pursuant to the Put Right, the Trustee shall then distribute such amount to the Holders of such Separate Notes.
 
 
(d) Notes purchased pursuant to the Put Right shall be cancelled by the Trustee.
Section 7.05
. Other Modification of Terms in Connection with a Successful Remarketing.
(a) In connection with a Successful Remarketing of the Notes, without the consent of any of the Holders of the Notes, the interest deferral provisions of the Notes set forth in Section 2.06 shall no longer apply.

. Additional Events of Default in Connection with the Put Right.
(a) if the Company has not paid all the Deferred Interest (including Compounded Interest thereon) in cash or by issuing Deferral Securities as described in Section 2.06 above, on or prior to the 30th day following the end of the Deferral Period; or
(b) if the Company has not paid, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Triggered Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the Put Price of any Note following the exercise or deemed exercise of the Put Right by any Holder of Notes.
In connection with a Successful Remarketing, so that the Notes will rank senior to all of the Company's existing and future junior subordinated obligations and junior to all of the Company's existing and future Senior Indebtedness, the Events of Default with respect to the Notes may be modified as the Company deems appropriate.
Section 8.02
. Dividend and other Payment Stoppage During Interest Deferral and Under Certain Other Circumstances.
(a) The Company hereby agrees that until the earliest of (1) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, (2) the Triggered Early Settlement Date and (3) the Optional Remarketing Settlement Date, if: (x) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (y) the Company has given notice of its election to defer Interest Payments but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced; or

(b) Notwithstanding the above provisions of Section 8.02(a), the restrictions therein contemplated shall not apply to:
(i) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock (or any Capital Stock of any of its subsidiaries) for or to any class or series of the Company's Capital Stock;
(ii) any purchase of, or payment in cash in lieu of, fractional interests in shares of the Company's Capital Stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such Capital Stock or the securities being converted or exchanged; and
(iii) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks with or junior to such stock.
