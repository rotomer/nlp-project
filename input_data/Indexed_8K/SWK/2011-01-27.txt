FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Stanley Black & Decker Reports 4Q 2010 and Full Year 2010 Results
New Britain, Connecticut, January 27th, 2011
...
Stanley Black & Decker today announced fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results.
(NYSE: SWK)
All pro-forma comparisons reflect adjustments made to the 4Q'09 results for Black & Decker to account for the four additional days the company operated during its standalone 4Q'09 versus 4Q'10 due to the shift to the Stanley fiscal calendar. The company has included a pro forma discussion comparing 4Q'10 to prior year for the legacy Black & Decker businesses in order to assist with the understanding of the company on a combined basis.
4Q'10 Key Points:
Black & Decker Integration Update: Cost & Revenue Synergies
When the combination of Stanley Black & Decker was announced, management provided a cost synergy target of $350 million to be achieved by year three after the closing of the deal (March 2013). Today, management is updating this estimate and now believes the company will achieve $425 million in cost synergies by the end of 2012.
The overwhelming majority of this $75 million excess over the original $350 million target is projected to fall to the bottom line. The outperformance is being driven by above estimate achievements in three of the four previously communicated areas for synergy realization: Manufacturing & Distribution, Sourcing & Procurement and Business & Regional Consolidation.
Additionally, management is targeting to achieve approximately $300  $400 million in revenue synergies by the end of 2013 driven by brand expansion, increased access to global markets through established distribution channels and cross-selling opportunities. At least two-thirds of the revenue synergies will occur within the CDIY segment with the remainder split relatively evenly between the Security and Industrial segments. These revenue synergies will be modestly accretive in 2011.
Stanley Black & Decker's President and CEO, John F. Lundgren, commented, 2010 was a landmark year for Stanley Black & Decker, driven largely by the significant progress we made in integrating Black & Decker. Notably, we were able to achieve 7% organic growth for the year on a pro forma basis amid an uncertain economic environment while continuing the integration in a manner that allowed us to exceed our original cost synergy targets. Our early success to date notwithstanding, we remain focused on effectively navigating the risks and challenges inherent in the integration projects that remain while embedding the Stanley Fulfillment System across the combined entity. We realize that our continued success is dependent upon the ongoing integration of Black & Decker, which is now in a critical phase that includes intensive and often interdependent systems conversions as well as changes within our plant and distribution center networks. Creating additional shareholder value from the successful integration remains management's top priority."

4Q'10 Segment Results
(Excludes One-Time Charges)
In the CDIY segment, Latin America, North America and Asia drove 4Q revenue and profit growth, offsetting modest weakness in Western Europe. Organic sales for Hand Tools, Fasteners & Storage rose 4% due to the success of Bostitch hand tools as well as Stanley-branded storage units. Price fell 1%. Currency had a negative 1% impact. Legacy Black & Decker Power Tools & Accessories organic sales increased approximately 4% with a 5% increase in unit volume, and a negative 1% impact due to price. In Professional Power Tools & Accessories, sales increased in the mid-teens driven by the successful global launch of the 12V Max lithium ion product line. Consumer Products Group volumes rose in the low single digits, driven by demand in Latin America for the new lithium ion power tools as well as new product launches within the home products line. Excluding one-time charges, overall segment profit was 11.3%, down from 11.9% in 4Q'09 as cost synergy realization only partially offset the negative mix impact of the legacy Black & Decker Power Tools and Accessories business and an unfavorable inflation/price arbitrage.
CDIY:
: Net sales in Security, excluding the legacy Black & Decker Hardware & Home Improvement business, increased 10% versus 4Q'09. Price (+1%) and acquisition growth (+11%) were partially offset by a 2% decline in unit volume. The Convergent Security business grew approximately 1% organically as recurring monthly revenue rose in the mid-single digits but was tempered by modest declines in installation volumes. The profitability of Stanley Solutions de Scurit, or SSDS, which was acquired in 1Q'10, continued to increase slightly as the integration progresses ahead of plan. Stanley Healthcare Solutions grew revenues 7% organically. Mechanical Access organic sales were down 4%, pressured by continued sluggish recovery within the commercial construction markets and weak demand from National Accounts. Revenues from the legacy Black & Decker Hardware & Home Improvement segment (excluding Pfister) increased approximately 1% from the prior year as Kwikset products showed strength, particularly in the home center channels. During the quarter, the Mechanical Access business acquired GMT Hardware Enterprise Corp. (GMT), a manufacturer and distributor of commercial hardware in China with 2009 revenues of $40 million, furthering the business' plan for global expansion. Excluding the SSDS and GMT acquisitions, the combined segment profit rate was 17.7%.
Security
Organic sales for the legacy Stanley businesses rose 18%, driven largely by strong performances in Industrial and Automotive Repair (IAR) and Infrastructure Solutions. The acquisition of CRC-Evans favorably impacted revenues by 30%. Currency had a negative 4% impact, while price had a positive 1% impact. IAR enjoyed significant end user market growth in all North America sales channels, particularly through industrial distribution, as well as significant market share gains. The legacy Black & Decker Engineered Fastening business delivered pro forma sales growth of approximately 15% driven by market share gains and increased platform penetration as well as increased automotive production in North America and Germany. Their unit volume increased 11%, while price had a negative 1% impact, acquisitions added 4% and currency was a positive 1%. Overall Industrial segment profit, excluding one-time charges, improved 350 bps versus prior year to 14.8%, attributable to the inclusion of the legacy Black & Decker Engineered Fastening business and CRC-Evans as well as operating leverage in the IAR and Infrastructure Solutions businesses.
Industrial:
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, James M. Loree, commented, "We are thankful to our associates for executing this major integration smoothly and effectively thus far. We are excited that we could today raise our merger-related cost savings targets to $425 million, $75 million above our original estimate, and at the same time, introduce a commitment of between $300 and $400 million for revenue synergies. This is a testament to both the compelling logic of the merger and the excellent execution of the integration by our colleagues around the globe. Further, we are very pleased with our new product and share growth momentum across our businesses as well as recent strategic progress in Industrial, emerging markets, and our Healthcare and Infrastructure growth platforms."
Full Year 2010 Key Points & Pro Forma Segment Results:
FY'10 Segment Results
(Excludes One-Time Charges)
Merger And Acquisition Related One-Time Charges and Credits
Total one-time charges related to Mergers and Acquisitions in 4Q'10 were $39 million. The gross margin includes $9 million of facility closure-related charges and a $1 million non-cash inventory step-up charge.  One-time costs recorded in SG&A, primarily for integration-related consulting fees, were $10 million. The $15 million credit in Other, net reflects $20 million of pension curtailment gains as certain Black & Decker pension plans will be replaced by defined contribution plans; this was partially offset by $5 million of deal costs. Merger-related restructuring charges and asset impairments, associated with planned facility closures and the severance of employees, totaled $34 million in 4Q'10.
Total one-time charges related to Mergers and Acquisitions for the full year were $538 million. The gross margin reflects $174 million for non-cash inventory step-up and $21 million of facility closure-related charges.  One-time costs reported in SG&A, primarily for integration-related consulting fees and employee retention, were $82 million. Other, net includes $57 million for deal costs, partially offset by the $20 million of previously mentioned pension curtailment gains. Merger-related restructuring charges and asset impairments, primarily pertaining to facility closures and the severance of employees, totaled $224 million for the year.
2011 Outlook
The company expects full year 2011 EPS to be in the range of $4.75  $5.00, excluding merger and acquisition related charges, based on the following assumptions:
Including all acquisition and Black & Decker transaction-related one-time charges, the company expects EPS to approximate $4.29 to $4.54 in 2011. For the full year of 2011 the company estimates the one-time charges to be as follows:
Free cash flow, excluding one-time charges and payments, is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. This implies increased 2011 capital expenditures due to revenue synergies and a modest benefit from working capital.
Donald Allan Jr, Senior Vice President and CFO commented, I am very pleased with our 2010 financial performance for it sets the stage for what is ahead. While our acquisition track record is solid and the pipeline is robust, our primary focus remains the integration of Black & Decker. In addition to the EPS performance and solid organic growth, achieving $935 million of 2010 free cash flow after only ten months as a combined organization makes a bullish statement about the future cash flow prospects of this company. We have excellent potential in 2011 to drive strong top and bottom line growth as well as continue to expand our free cash flow base and our guidance reflects this. With the stronger outlook in both these areas, management will be reviewing the timing and magnitude of the company's dividend increase at its upcoming February board meeting, two quarters earlier in the year than normal."

Organic sales growth is defined as total sales growth less sales of companies acquired in the past twelve months and less foreign currency impacts. Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales less SG&A.  Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. The normalized statement of operations and business segment information, as reconciled to GAAP on pages 11-12 and 16-17 for 2010 and pages 18-21 for 2009, is considered relevant to aid analysis of the company's margin and earnings results aside from the material impact of the one-time charges associated with the Black & Decker merger and the acquisitions of CRC-Evans and SSDS.
Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures.  Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners.  Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items.   Normalized cash flow and free cash flow, as reconciled to the associated GAAP measures on pages 14 and 15, are considered meaningful pro forma metrics to aid the understanding of the company's cash flow performance aside from the material impact of the Black & Decker merger-related payments and charges.   
The term "pro forma" is used to describe the company's results as if Black & Decker had been included in 2009, rather than from the March 12, 2010 merger date.  Such pro forma amounts and measures are provided to facilitate understanding the company's performance due to the significance of the merger with Black & Decker.  These pro forma measures do not include the effects of any of the other acquisitions such as CRC Evans acquired in July 2010.
