Southwestern Energy Company 2350 North Sam Houston Parkway East Suite 300 Houston, Texas 77032 (281) 618-4700 Fax: (281) 618-4818 NEWS RELEASE SOUTHWESTERN ENERGY COMPANY ANNOUNCES INCREASE IN 2002 CAPITAL BUDGET AND ADDITIONAL EARNINGS GUIDANCE Houston, Texas - May 15, 2002...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) announced today that its Board of Directors approved the addition of $10 million to its previous 2002 capital budget, with the increase allocated to the Company's oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) segment. With this increase Southwestern's 2002 E&P capital program now totals approximately $71 million. The additional capital will be invested in the Company's infill drilling program at its Overton Field in East Texas. "Our previous E&P capital plan was built on a conservative NYMEX price deck of $2.25 natural gas and $18.00 oil. The lower drilling costs that we are currently enjoying, combined with significantly higher commodity prices for the remainder of 2002, have allowed us to accelerate our drilling at Overton. The economics of these wells at current gas prices and drilling costs add significant value for our shareholders, so increasing our activity here makes a lot of sense," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern. Southwestern Issues Additional Earnings Guidance for 2002 With the recent increase in natural gas prices, the Company updated its outlook for 2002 with guidance on key financial information over a broader range of NYMEX natural gas prices. Southwestern's full-year 2002 oil and gas production target remains at 41.5 - 42.5 Bcfe, unchanged from the guidance that was issued on February 14, 2002. The following table and corresponding estimated results assumes various average NYMEX gas price scenarios with a $21.00 per barrel WTI oil price, and includes current hedges in place: - 3 -
