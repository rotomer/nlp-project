In accordance with Regulation G, a reconciliation of Cash Flow, as presented, to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities from the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 is hereby furnished:
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. We have included information concerning EBITDA because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure commonly used in the energy industry. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to EBITDA as defined.
