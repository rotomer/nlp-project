Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Cash Flow
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company does not forecast changes in operating assets and liabilities and, therefore, a reconciliation of the company's 2004 forecasted net cash provided by o perating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to net cash provided by operating activities is not provided. However, the table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's historical financial information.
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for 2000 would have been $58.1 million excluding the effects of unusual items for the Hales judgment and other litigation.
(Slide 32)
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Southwestern has included information concerning EBITDA because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure commonly used in the energy industry. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of the company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net income is a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles EBITDA as defined with net income as derived from the company's historical financial information.
 
(1)Amounts exclude unusual and extraordinary items. (2) Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes the amortization of restricted stock issued under the company's incentive compensation plan. (3)Provision for income taxes for 2003 includes the tax benefit associated with the cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle.
The table below reconciles EBITDA with net income assuming different NYMEX price scenarios and their corresponding estimated impact on the company's results for 2004, including current hedges in place, as of February 19, 2004:
