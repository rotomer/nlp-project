The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of the Underwriters' expenses except that, if this Agreement shall not be consummated because the conditions in Section 6 hereof (other than the condition contained in Section 6(d)) are not satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Representatives pursuant to clauses (i), (v) or (vi) in Section 11 hereof, unless such failure to satisfy said condition be due to the default or omission of any Underwriter, then the Company shall reimburse the several Underwriters for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of outside counsel), reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing to market the Shares or in contemplation of performing their obligations hereunder; but the Company shall not in any event be liable to any of the several Underwriters for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale by them of the Shares.  The reimbursement obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section 5 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Indemnification
.  
(a)
The Company agrees:
(i)
to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Underwriter or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon  (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof.
provided
however
(ii)
to reimburse each Underwriter and each such controlling person upon demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability, action or proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry related to the offering of the Shares, whether or not such Underwriter or controlling person is a party to any action or proceeding.  In the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Underwriters were not entitled to receive payments for legal and other expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Underwriters will promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto.
(b)
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i)  any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the  circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; , , that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or through the Representatives specifically for use in the preparation thereof.  
provided
however
(c)
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing.  No indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Subsection if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on accou nt of the provisions of Section 8(a) or (b).  In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled  to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event  (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel,  (ii) the named parties to a ny such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of commencement of the action.
It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all such indemnified parties.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consen t of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes (i) an
unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.  
(d)
If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified par ty in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect  not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to i nformation supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Subsection were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Subsection.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Subsection shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Subsection, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the under writing discounts and commissions applicable to the Shares purchased by such Underwriter and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this Subsection to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e)
Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses are incurred upon demand by such indemnified party.  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.
9.
Default by Underwriters
.  
If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in their obligations to purchase Shares hereunder on either the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, if any, and the aggregate number of Shares that such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total number of Shares that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date or Option Closing Date, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Shares by other persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are made by such Closing Date or Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Shares that such defaulting Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date or Op tion Closing Date.  If any Underwriter or Underwriters so default and the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total number of Shares that the Underwriters are obligated to purchase on such Closing Date or Option Closing Date and arrangements satisfactory to RBC Capital Markets Corporation and the Company for the purchase of such Shares by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8 (provided that if such default occurs with respect to Option Shares after the Closing Date, this Agreement will not terminate as to the Firm Shares).  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 9.  Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

Very truly yours,
Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton shall have furnished to the Underwriters their written opinion, as counsel to the Company, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Closing Date or Option Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, substantially to the effect set forth below:
(i)
The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement will not, (a) require any consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States or the State of New York that in our experience would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (but counsel need not express an opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws) or (b) result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the agreements of the Company identified in Exhibit A to such opinion.
(ii)
The Company is not required to register under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and no such registration of the Company required for the offer and sale of the Securities by the Company in the manner contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Prospectus.
(iii)
The statements set forth under the heading "U.S. Tax Consequences to Non-United States Holders" in the Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Shares by a person that is not a "United States person" for United States' income tax purposes, provide a fair and accurate summary of such tax consequences.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America, except that we express no opinion as to any federal energy or public utility laws or any other federal laws specifically relating to public utilities or the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.
In addition to the matters set forth above, such counsel shall also provide a letter to the effect that the Registration Statement (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements and related schedules, reserve estimates or the statistical and operating data therein or the exhibits thereto), as of its effective date and as of the Closing Date, and the Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of its date and as of the Closing Date, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Rules, and nothing has come to the attention of such counsel that leads them to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective under the Securities Act and as of the Closing Date or Option Closing Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, on the date it was filed pursuant to the Securities Act Rules and as of the Closing Date or Option Closing Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (except that such counsel need express no view as to financial statements and related schedules, reserve estimates or the statistical and operating data therein).  With respect to such statement, such counsel may state that their belief is based upon the procedures set forth therein, but is without independent check and verification.
Mark K. Boling, General Counsel of the Company and/or Jeffrey L. Dangeau, General Counsel of Arkansas Western Gas Company, shall have furnished to the Underwriters their written opinion, as counsel to the Company, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Closing Date or Option Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter, substantially to the aggregate effect set forth below:

The Company and each of its subsidiaries are duly qualified to transact business in all jurisdictions in which the conduct of their business requires such qualification, or in which the failure to qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect upon the business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Except as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, to the knowledge of such counsel, there are no outstanding securities of the Company convertible or exchangeable into or evidencing the right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of capital stock of the Company and there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants or rights of any character obligating the Company to issue any shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or evidencing the right to purchase or subscribe for any shares of such stock; and except as described in the Prospectus, to the knowledge of such counsel, no holder of any securities of the Company or any other person has the right, contractual or otherwise, that has not been satisfied or effectively waived, to cause the Company to sell or otherwise issue to them, or to permit them to underwrite the sa le of, any of the Shares or the right to have any common stock or other securities of the Company included in the Registration Statement or the right, as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement, to require registration under the Securities Act of any shares of common stock or other securities of the Company.
(v)
Such counsel does not know of any contracts or documents required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus that are not so filed or described as required, and such contracts and documents as are
summarized in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus are fairly summarized in all material respects.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter was prepared pursuant to the request of Southwestern Energy Company (the "Company") and is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(k) of the Underwriting Agreement by and between you and the Company dated September 14, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement").  We have prepared an audit of the Company's estimates of proved reserves attributable to the interests of the Company as of December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Reserve Audit").  Further, we have (i) audited the Company's reserve additions for the first and second quarters of 2005 as reflected in our letters to the Company dated April 26, 2005 and July 22, 2005 (the "2005 Reserve Additions Audits") and (ii) estimated the gross proved plus probable ultimate recovery, as of July 31, 2005, for certain horizontal wells in the Company's Fayetteville Shale project as reflected in our letter to the Company dated August 5, 2005 (the "Proved Plus Probable EUR Letter").  It should be noted that probable reserves are not recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, we also prepared previous audits of the Company's estimates of proved reserves attributable to the interests of the Company as of December 31 of each of the two years ending in 2003 (the "Previous Reserve Audits," and collectively with the 2004 Reserve Audit and the 2005 Reserve Additions Audits, the "Reserve Audits").  Parts of the Reserve Audits are discussed and included in the prospectus dated September 1, 2005 and prospectus supplement dated September 14, 2005 including any documents incorporated by reference therein, (collectively, the "Prospectus").  We have reviewed the sections of the Prospectus where we or such Reserve Audits are referenced.
We are independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company.  Our employment by the Company for work performed in connection with the Prospectus and the Reserve Audits was not on a contingent basis.  At the time of preparation of our Reserve Audits we did not have, and at the date hereof we do not have, any financial interest in the Company.  We are not connected with the Company as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer, or employee.
The estimates of the proved reserves attributable to the interests of the Company set forth in (i) the Prospectus and (ii) the 2005 Reserve Additions Audits correctly reflect the Company's estimates of these amounts as presented in the Reserve Audits.  These amounts were estimated in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
Since the respective dates of the 2004 Reserve Audit and the 2005 Reserve Additions Audits, nothing has been brought to our attention by the Company that would lead us to believe that there has been a material decrease in the Company's estimated reserves as presented in our 2004 Reserve Audit and the 2005 Reserve Additions Audits, except for reductions attributable to actual production.
We affirm as of the date hereof, that nothing has been brought to our attention by the Company that would lead us to believe that there has been a material decrease in the estimates made in the Proved Plus Probable EUR Letter.
This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities, and it is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to within or without the underwriting group for any other purpose, including, but not limited to, the registration, purchase or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the Underwriting Agreement.
Very truly yours,
