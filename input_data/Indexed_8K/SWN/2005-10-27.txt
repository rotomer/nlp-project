NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  October 27, 2005...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2005. Highlights include:
Record earnings of $39.5 million, up 55% from the same period in 2004
Record net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $80.3 million, up 37% from the same period in 2004
Natural gas and crude oil production of 16.2 Bcfe, up 8% sequentially over second quarter 2005 and third quarter 2004 levels
For the third quarter of 2005, Southwestern reported net income of $39.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, up 55% from $25.4 million, or $0.34* per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below), was $80.3 million in the third quarter of 2005, up 37% from $58.5 million for the same period in 2004.  An 8% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses, drove the improved financial results.
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $98.9 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, up 40% from $70.7 million, or $0.96* per diluted share, for the same period in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $219.0 million for the first nine months of 2005, up 32% from $165.3 million for the same period in 2004.
"The third quarter of 2005 was marked by several significant achievements for our company," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "Our net income, cash flow and production for the quarter reached record levels and were the highest in the company's history. We also successfully completed an equity offering to accelerate our development of the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas. Our balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been and we are well-positioned to continue our growth."

Third Quarter of 2005 Financial Results
- Operating income for the company's E&P segment was $68.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005, up from $43.1 million for the same period in 2004. The increase was primarily due to an 8% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 16.2 Bcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2005, up from 15.0 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in production during the third quarter of 2005 resulted primarily from an increase in production from the company's Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin. During the third quarter of 2005, the company experienced an estimated combined reduction of approximately 0.2 Bcfe of production from its Gulf Coast operations as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.98 per Mcf (including the effect of hedges) in the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to $5.04 per Mcf in the same period of 2004. The company's hedging activities decreased the average gas price realized during the third quarter of 2005 by $0.91 per Mcf, compared to a decrease of $0.45 per Mcf during the same period of 2004. Locational differences in market prices for natural gas have continued to be wider than historically experienced. Disregarding the impact of the company's hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the third quarter of 2005 was approximately $0.60 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.27 per Mcf during the third quarter of 2004.
Earlier this year, the company increased its program of locational basis hedging in order to mitigate the impact of the widening of the locational differences in market prices for natural gas. In the third quarter of 2005, earnings included the net effect of a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, relating to gains on future basis hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by a loss associated with hedge ineffectiveness. Including the impact of the company's basis hedges, the company currently estimates that its average realized market differentials for its natural gas production in the fourth quarter of 2005 will be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00 per Mcf.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $47.23 per barrel, including the effect of hedges, during the third quarter of 2005 compared to $31.21 per barrel in the third quarter of 2004. The average realized oil prices for the third quarter of 2005 and 2004 were reduced by $13.84 per barrel and $11.57 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of Southwestern's hedging activities.
Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the company's E&P segment were $0.51 for the third quarter of 2005, compared to $0.38 for the same period in 2004. The increase in lease operating expenses per Mcfe in 2005 resulted from increases in compression, saltwater disposal and gas processing costs as wells as generally higher oil field service costs. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.42 during the third quarter of 2005, as compared with $0.33 for the same period in 2004. General and administrative expenses for the E&P segment were higher primarily due to increased compensation costs
 
associated with higher staffing levels. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.40 during the third quarter of 2005, compared to $0.24 per Mcfe during the same period in 2004. The increase in 2005 was due primarily to comparatively higher average market prices for natural gas and crude oil, as reflected in the average price received for the company's production excluding the effect of hedges. The company's full cost pool amortization rate increased to $1.44 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $1.19 per Mcfe for the same period in 2004, primarily due to increased finding and development costs. Southwestern expects its full cost pool amortization rate to average between $1.40 and $1.45 per Mcfe for 2005.
- The company's utility segment recorded a seasonal operating loss of $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared to an operating loss of $2.7 million during the same period in 2004. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreased deliveries caused by warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
- Operating income for the company's Midstream Services segment, which is comprised of natural gas marketing and gathering activities, was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005, compared to $0.7 million in the same period in 2004. Additionally, the company recorded pre-tax income from operations relating to the company's 25% interest in the Ozark Gas Transmission System of $0.1 million during the third quarter of 2005, compared to a pre-tax loss of $0.6 million for the same period in 2004.
Midstream Services Segment and Other
First Nine Months of 2005 Financial Results
 
- Operating income for the E&P segment was $165.2 million during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $114.0 million during the first nine months of 2004. The increase was primarily due to a 16% increase in production volumes combined with higher realized oil and gas prices. Revenues for the first nine months of 2005 and 2004 also included pre-tax gains of $2.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, related to the sale of gas in storage inventory.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production increased to 45.2 Bcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, as compared to 39.0 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2004. The increase in production resulted primarily from an increase in production from the company's Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin. Production during the first nine months of 2005 included the effects of curtailment of a portion of the company's production at the Overton Field due to pipeline repairs of a non-operated transmission line into which Southwestern delivers a large portion of its gas production.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.16 per Mcf (including the effect of hedges) in the first nine months of 2005 compared to $5.07 per Mcf in the first nine months of 2004. The company's hedging activities decreased the average gas price realized during the first nine months of 2005 by $0.58 per Mcf, compared to a decrease of $0.48 per Mcf during the same period of 2004. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first nine months of 2005 was approximately $0.42 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to the average for the prior year period of approximately $0.26 per Mcf. This change was primarily
 
due to widening locational market differentials that have occurred since the fourth quarter of 2004.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, earnings included the net effect of a pre-tax gain of $9.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, relating to gains on future basis hedges, partially offset by a loss associated with hedge ineffectiveness.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $42.29 per barrel for the first nine months of 2005, compared to $29.51 per barrel during the first nine months of 2004. The average realized oil prices for the first nine months of 2005 and 2004 were reduced by $11.07 per barrel and $8.56 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of Southwestern's hedging activities.
Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the company's E&P segment were $0.46 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $0.38 per Mcfe during the same period in 2004, due to increases in compression, saltwater disposal and gas processing costs as well as generally higher oil field service costs. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.40 during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $0.35 per Mcfe in the same period in 2004, primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased staffing levels. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.35 during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $0.26 per Mcfe during the same period in 2004, primarily due to comparatively higher average market prices in effect for natural gas and crude oil. The company's full cost pool amortization rate increased to $1.37 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2005, compared to $1 .19 per Mcfe for the same period in 2004, primarily due to increased finding and development costs.
Operating income for Southwestern's utility was $1.9 million during the first nine months of 2005, down from $4.7 million during the first nine months of 2004. The decrease in operating income for this segment resulted from decreased deliveries caused by warmer weather for the first nine months of 2005, which was 10% warmer than normal and 4% warmer than the same period in 2004, and from increased operating costs and expenses.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment -
Operating income for the company's natural gas marketing and gathering activities was $3.5 million during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $2.4 million in the same period in 2004. The company also recorded pre-tax income from operations related to its investment in NOARK of $0.4 million during the first nine months of 2005, compared to pre-tax loss of $1.1 million in the same period in 2004.
Midstream Services Segment and Other -
E&P Operations Review
Southwestern invested a total of $323.3 million in its E&P program during the first nine months of 2005, compared to $210.7 million invested during the first nine months of 2004. At September 30, 2005, Southwestern had participated in drilling 186 wells. Of these, 155 were successful, seven were dry and 24 were still in progress at the end of the third quarter, for an overall success rate of 96%.
- In the first nine months of 2005, Southwestern invested approximately $84.0 million in its Fayetteville Shale play, including $50.8 million to drill 44 wells and $28.1 million for leasehold. As of September 30, 2005, Southwestern held a total of approximately 849,000 net acres (724,000 net undeveloped acres and approximately 125,000 net developed acres that is held by conventional production) in the play area.
Fayetteville Shale Play
To date, Southwestern has drilled a total of 66 wells and participated in one outside-operated well in the Fayetteville Shale play. The wells are located in ten separate pilot areas located in Franklin, Conway, Van Buren, Cleburne and Faulkner counties in Arkansas. One of the Southwestern's new pilot areas is located approximately five miles south of the company's Griffin Mountain Field and another new pilot area is located approximately ten miles northeast of the company's Cove Creek Field. Southwestern has drilled one vertical well in each of the new pilot are as, one of which is currently being completed and the other is waiting on pipeline connection after testing at approximately 811 Mcf per day.
Of the 67 wells, 51 are producing, 11 are in some stage of completion or waiting on pipeline hook-up, two are shut-in due to marginal performance or temporarily abandoned and three have been spudded but have not reached total depth. The company's current gross production from the Fayetteville Shale play is approximately 12 MMcf per day.
Eighteen of the 67 wells drilled are horizontal wells located in four separate pilot areas. Of the 18 horizontal wells, 12 have been completed, two are waiting on completion, one has been temporarily abandoned due to mechanical problems and three are in the drilling phase. The average initial test rate for the completed horizontal wells, excluding the company's first horizontal well, the Vaughan #4-22-H, in which wellbore problems limited the fracture stimulation treatment, is 2.5 MMcf per day. Based on early production histories and modeling, Southwestern believes the average ultimate production from these horizontal wells will be between 1.3 Bcf and 1.7 Bcf per well. Most recent completed well costs for the horizontal wells have ranged between $1.4 million and $1.8 million per well, excluding non-recurring costs, and have taken 16 days on average to reach total depth.  
The company utilized a slickwater fracture stimulation treatment for the first time in a horizontal well in the McNew #4-2-H well, located in the company's Gravel Hill Field. The well is currently producing 1.2 MMcf per day and 70 to 80 barrels of water per day and has shown little discernible decline after being on production for approximately three weeks.
The company experienced significant mechanical problems with contracted drilling rigs in its Fayetteville Shale program during the third quarter. As of October 27, 2005, the company has two drilling rigs running in the play area, after releasing two rigs due to excessive downtime. As a result, the company currently expects to drill between 60 and 70 wells in 2005, compared to the company's previous estimate of 80 to 90 wells, and has lowered its 2005 production guidance for its Fayetteville Shale play to approximately 2.0 Bcf. Due to the reduced well count and production lost due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the company expects its full year 2005 production to be at, or slightly below, the lower end of its previous guidance of 62.0 Bcfe.
 
As previously announced, Southwestern entered into sales agreements with a private company to build a total of ten new land drilling rigs capable of drilling both vertical and horizontal wells in the Fayetteville Shale. The first rig is expected to be delivered in late November 2005 with one additional rig delivered each month thereafter. Southwestern expects to have five to six rigs running in the play by year-end 2005.
Over the next two months, Southwestern plans to test seven new pilot areas, including a horizontal well in the Fairway area of the Arkoma Basin which is approximately 70 miles west of the company's existing horizontal wells. Over the next 12 to 15 months, Southwestern expects to continue its evaluation of its acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play by testing an additional 35 to 40 pilot areas by year-end 2006. Southwestern expects to drill between 175 to 200 wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area in 2006, with up to 15 rigs running in the play by year-end 2006.
In late September, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (AOGC) approved field rules for the company's Cove Creek Field located in Van Buren and Faulkner counties in Arkansas. The AOGC approved well spacing requirements that provide for 560 feet minimum distance between completions in common sources of supply within the Fayetteville Shale formation within each unit, up to a maximum of 25 wells per square mile (640 acres). These field rules are the same as those previously approved in 2005 by the AOGC in the company's Griffin Mountain, Gravel Hill and Scotland Fields.
       
- Southwestern participated in 33 wells in its Ranger Anticline project area during the first nine months of 2005, 27 of which were productive, four were in progress and two were dry holes at September 30, 2005. The Ranger Anticline, located in Yell and Logan Counties, Arkansas, produces from the conventional Borum sands between 5,500 and 8,500 feet. Of the 33 wells, 19 are located in the core producing area of the field, eight are located in the western expansion area Southwestern began developing in 2004, and six are in an eastern expansion area up to nine miles from the proven productive part of the field.
Conventional Arkoma Program
Additionally, the company is drilling an Arbuckle exploration test northeast of its Ranger Anticline area. The USA #1-24 well is expected to be at a total depth of approximately 14,200 feet at the end of November.
- Through the first nine months of 2005, Southwestern spudded 55 wells at its Overton Field in Smith County, Texas, bringing the total number of wells drilled in the field to 228 wells. The company's drilling success rate since it began its drilling program in the field in 2001 is 100%. A portion of the company's production at Overton during the first and second quarters of 2005 was curtailed due to pipeline repairs to a non-operated transmission line into which the company delivers a large portion of its gas production. The curtailment issues at Overton were resolved late in the second quarter, and current gross production from the field is approximately 100 MMcf equivalent per day.
East Texas
 
In addition to its Overton Field, Southwestern continues to be active in other areas in East Texas. In the last year, the company has acquired a total of 12,800 net undeveloped acres in four development areas primarily located in southern Nacogdoches county, referred to collectively as the Angelina River Trend. Since late-2004, Southwestern has drilled eight wells in this trend, of which six are currently on production and the remaining two are currently being completed. The six producing wells have tested at an average initial production rate of 3.4 MMcf per day. The company expects to drill three more wells here by the end of the year, with additional drilling planned for 2006.
- During 2005, Southwestern has leased over 48,000 net acres in the Permian Basin Barnett Shale play in West Texas. The company expects to test its first well in the play, a re-entry of an existing wellbore, in early 2006.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before change s in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
Southwestern will host a teleconference call on Friday, October 28, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern to discuss the company's third quarter 2005 financial and operating results.
