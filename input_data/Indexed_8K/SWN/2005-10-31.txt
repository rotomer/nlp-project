SECTION 1.  Registrant's Business and Operations.
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As of October 27, 2005, Southwestern Energy Company (the "Company") amended and restated the indemnity agreements (the "Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements") it had previously entered into with each of its executive officers and directors.  It is the policy of the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into indemnity agreements with their respective executive officers, directors and key employees (each, an "Indemnitee").  
The Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements provide indemnification of an Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law and specifically obligate the Company and its subsidiaries to (i) indemnify an Indemnitee against all liabilities and losses incurred in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (including, but not limited to, any action by or in the right of the Company), to which the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, is threatened to be made a party, or is involved (as a witness or otherwise), by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company or any subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee or ag ent (including a fiduciary) of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent; and (ii) pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, and his or her executors, administrators, heirs or assigns, any amount which he or she is or becomes legally obligated to pay because of any claim or claims made against the Indemnitee because of any act or omission or neglect or breach of duty, including any actual or alleged error or misstatement or misleading statement, which Indemnitee commits or suffers while acting in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or any of the subsidiaries.  The payments which the Company and/or the subsidiaries will be obligated to make under the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements shall include, , com pensatory and punitive damages, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, settlements and costs, costs of investigation, (excluding salaries as officers or employees of the Company and/or the subsidiaries), attorneys' fees, costs of appearance, attachment and similar bonds and other legal costs of actions, claims, proceedings, investigations and alternative dispute mechanisms, (including actions, claims, proceedings, investigations or alternative dispute mechanisms by or on behalf of the Company and/or any subsidiary and appeals therefrom), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other.
inter alia
The Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements provide for the advancement of any and all reasonable expenses specifically documented (including legal fees and expenses) as being incurred in investigating or defending prior to any final disposition of any threatened or pending action, suit or proceedings (whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other) within thirty (30) days after receiving invoices for such expenses.  The Indemnitee agrees that the Indemnitee will promptly reimburse the Company and/or each relevant subsidiary for all expenses advanced or paid by the Company and/or each relevant subsidiary in defending any action, suit or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, against the Indemnitee in the event and only to the extent that it shall ultimately be determined by a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter tha t the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company and/or any relevant subsidiary for such expenses under the provision of the state statutes, bylaws, the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreement, or otherwise, or that it is unlawful for the Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company and/or any relevant subsidiary for such expenses.  Additionally, the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements provide that if the Company or a subsidiary pays an Indemnitee pursuant to the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements, the Company or a subsidiary, as the case may be, will be subrogated to the Indemnitee's rights to recover from third parties.
The Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements prohibit indemnification (i) in respect of remuneration paid to the Indemnitee if it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such remuneration was in violation of law; (ii) for an accounting or profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company or any subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal or state statutory law or common law, (iii) on account of the Indemnitee's conduct which is finally adjudged to have been knowingly fraudulent, deliberately dishonest, grossly negligent, or willful and wanton misconduct in the performance of his or her duties, which such conduct is material to the establishment of liability for which indemnification is sought pursuant to the t erms of this Agreement, or (iv) if a final decision by a court shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful or is against public policy.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Company has also agreed to maintain the existing director's and officers' insurance policies covering the Indemnitee for so long as the Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company or any subsidiary (or shall continue at the request of the Company to serve as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise), and for a period of time following the Indemnitee's cessation of such service (but in no event longer than four (4) years).  
The Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements also provide that if there is a change in control of the Company, the Company will seek legal advice from special, independent counsel selected by the Indemnitee and approved by the Company with respect to matters thereafter arising concerning rights of the Indemnitee under the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreement.  
This brief description of the Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreements is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

AMENDED AND RESTATED INDEMNITY AGREEMENT
This Amended and Restated Indemnity Agreement (this Agreement) dated October 27, 2005 among Southwestern Energy Company (the Company) and each of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries that are identified on the signature page hereof (collectively, the Subsidiaries), with offices located in Houston, Texas and Fayetteville, Arkansas, and ___________  (the Indemnitee).

WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is currently serving as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or one or more of the Subsidiaries and in such capacity has performed and is performing valuable services for the Company and/or the Subsidiaries; and
WHEREAS, the Company's and each Subsidiary's bylaws (the Bylaws) provide for the indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents (including fiduciaries) and the advancement of certain litigation expenses for directors, officers, employees and agents (including fiduciaries) to the maximum extent authorized by the Arkansas Business Corporation Act of 1987, the Arkansas Small Business Entity Pass Through Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended from time to time and including any successor acts thereto, collectively, the State Statutes); and
"
"
"
"
WHEREAS, the State Statutes provide that the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses authorized thereunder are not exclusive; and
WHEREAS, under the State Statutes, the Company and each Subsidiary has the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who (i) is or was a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company or such Subsidiary, or (ii) is or was serving, at the request of such corporation, as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent
(including a fiduciary) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Company or such Subsidiary would  have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the State Statutes; and
WHEREAS, developments with respect to the terms and availability of a policy of Directors and Officers Liability Insurance (D&O Insurance) and with respect to the terms and enforcement of statutory and by-law provisions concerning indemnification and the advancement of expenses generally have raised questions concerning the adequacy and reliability of the protection that these provisions provide; and
'
'
"
"
WHEREAS, in order to resolve these questions and induce Indemnitee to continue to serve as an officer, director, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries, the Company and each Subsidiary have determined that it is in the best interest of the Company and each Subsidiary and their stockholders to enter into this Agreement with Indemnitee;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the Indemnitee's continued service as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or one or more of the Subsidiaries the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.
.  Subject to the limitations, terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the limitations in Section 4, the Company and each Subsidiary hereby agree to:
Indemnification and Payment of Expenses
(a)
hold harmless and indemnify the Indemnitee against all liabilities and losses incurred in connection with any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other (including, but not limited to,
any action by or in the right of the Company), to which the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a party, is threatened to be made a party, or is involved (as a witness or otherwise), by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is, was or at any time becomes a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company or any Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent; and
(b)
pay on behalf of the Indemnitee, and his or her executors, administrators, heirs or assigns, any amount which he or she is or becomes legally obligated to pay because of any claim or claims made against the Indemnitee because of any act or omission or neglect or breach of duty, including any actual or alleged error or misstatement or misleading statement, which Indemnitee commits or suffers while acting in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries.  The payments which the Company and/or the Subsidiaries will be obligated to make hereunder shall include, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties, settlements and costs, costs of investigation, (excluding salaries as officers or employees of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries), a ttorneys fees, costs of appearance, attachment and similar bonds and other legal costs of actions, claims, proceedings, investigations and alternative dispute mechanisms, (including actions, claims, proceedings, investigations or alternative dispute mechanisms by or on behalf of the Company and/or any Subsidiary and appeals therefrom), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other.
'
2.
.  (a)  The Company and each Subsidiary hereby agree to indemnify the Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, notwithstanding that such indemnification is not specifically authorized by the other provisions of this Agreement, the Companys or such Subsidiarys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or by statute.  In the event of any change after the date of this Agreement in any applicable law, statute or rule which expands the right of an Arkansas corporation, an Arkansas limited liability company or a Delaware corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents (including fiduciaries), it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits afforded by such change.  In the event of any change in any ap plicable law, statute or rule which narrows the right of an Arkansas corporation, an Arkansas limited liability company or a Delaware corporation to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents (including fiduciaries), such change, to the extent not otherwise required by such law, statute or rule to be applied to this Agreement, shall have no effect on this Agreement or the parties rights and obligations hereunder except as set forth in Section 4(d).
Additional Indemnification; Nonexclusivity
'
'
'
(b)
The indemnification provided by this Agreement shall be in addition to any rights to which Indemnitee may be entitled under the Companys or any Subsidiarys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the State Statutes, or otherwise.  The indemnification provided under this Agreement shall continue as to Indemnitee for any action Indemnitee took or did not take while serving in an indemnified capacity even though Indemnitee may have ceased to serve in such capacity.
'
'
3.
.  (a)  If the Company has D&O Insurance in effect at the time the Company receives from Indemnitee any notice of commencement of an action, suit or proceeding, the Company shall give prompt notice of such
Notice of Claim; Subrogation; No Duplication of Payments
commencement to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the policy.  The Company shall thereafter take all necessary and desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such action, suit or proceeding  in accordance with the terms of such policy.
(b)
In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who hereby agrees to execute all documents required and to do everything that may be necessary to secure such subrogation rights, including the execution of such documents necessary or desirable to enable the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
(c)
The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts paid in settlement) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under this Agreement or any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
4.
.  Notwithstanding the provision of Section 1 or any other provision of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim made against the Indemnitee:
Exceptions to Indemnification
(a)
in respect of remuneration paid to the Indemnitee if it shall be determined by a final judgment or other final adjudication that such remuneration was in violation of law; or
(b)
for an accounting or profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of Section
16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal or state statutory law or common law; or
(c)
on account of the Indemnitee's conduct which is finally adjudged to have been knowingly fraudulent, deliberately dishonest, grossly negligent, or willful and wanton misconduct in the performance of his or her duties, which such conduct is material to the establishment of liability for which indemnification is sought pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; or
(d)
if a final decision by a court shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful or is against public policy.
5.
.  All agreements and obligations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall continue during the period the Indemnitee is a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or any Subsidiary (or is or was serving at the request of the Company and/or any Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or agent (including a fiduciary) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) and shall continue thereafter so long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee was serving as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company and/or any Subsidiary or serving in any other capacity referred to in this Section.
Continuation
6.
.  Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of any action, suit or proceedings, the Indemnitee is hereby required, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Company and/or any Subsidiary under this Agreement to notify the Company and each relevant Subsidiary of the commencement thereof; but the omission so
Notice and Defense
to notify the Company and each relevant Subsidiary will not relieve the Company nor any relevant Subsidiary from any liability which they may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Agreement except to the extent that such lack of prompt notification shall cause the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary to be denied coverage under any insurance policy that may then be in effect.  With respect to any such action, suit or proceedings as to which the Indemnitee notifies the Company and or any Subsidiary of the commencement thereof:
(a)
the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary will be entitled to participate therein at their own expense;
(b)
except as otherwise provided below to the extent that they may wish, the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified will be entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee.  After notice from the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary to the Indemnitee of its election to so assume the defense thereof, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below.  The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such action, suit or proceedings but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Company and/or each relevant Subs idiary of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized in writing by an executive officer of the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary, (ii) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense
of such action, or (iii) the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be entitled to assume the defense of any action, suit or proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Company and/or any Subsidiary or as to which the Indemnitee shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above; and
(c)
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be liable to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement or compromise of any action or claim effected without the prior written consent of the Company and each relevant Subsidiary.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee.  Neither the Company, any Subsidiary, nor the Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed settlement.
7.
.  In the event that the Indemnitee employs his or her own counsel pursuant to Section 6(b)(i) through (iii) of this Agreement, the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary shall advance to the Indemnitee, prior to any final disposition of any threatened or pending action, suit or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, any and all reasonable expenses specifically documented (including legal fees and expenses) as being incurred in investigating or defending any such action, suit or proceedings within thirty (30) days after receiving copies of invoices presented to the Indemnitee for such expenses.
Expenses
8.
.  The Indemnitee agrees that the Indemnitee will promptly reimburse the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary for all expenses advanced or paid by the Company and/or each relevant Subsidiary in defending any action, suit or proceedings, whether civil,
Repayment of Expenses
criminal, administrative or investigative, against the Indemnitee in the event and only to the extent that it shall ultimately be determined by a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary for such expenses under the provision of the State Statutes, Bylaws, this Agreement, or otherwise, or that it is unlawful for the Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Company and/or any relevant Subsidiary for such expenses.  The Indemnitee shall be required to reimburse only those entities from which he or she is not entitled to indemnification under the judicial determination described above and only to the extent of such entities' contribution to expenses advanced or paid.  If the judicial determination requires reimbursement by the Indemnitee but provides no basis for allocation of the reimbursement among the relevant entities, such reimbursement shall be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the contribution made by each entity to which reimbursement is required to total contributions.
9.
.  (a)  The Company, on behalf of itself and the Subsidiaries, represents that it presently has in force and effect one or more policy or policies of D&O Insurance covering liabilities, which may include those which are not indemnifiable under the State Statutes, which may be asserted against or incurred by directors, officers, employees and agents (including fiduciaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries in their performance of services, underwritten by reputable insurance companies and in such amounts as the Board of Directors of the Company deems appropriate (the Insurance Policies).  The Company agrees, that so long as the Indemnitee shall continue to serve as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company or any Subsidiary (or shall continue at the request of the Company to serve as a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise), the Company shall maintain the Insurance Policies.  In addition,
Maintenance of Insurance
"
"
following the Indemnitees cessation of such service (but in no event longer than four (4) years), the Company agrees that so long as the Indemnitee shall be subject to any possible claim or threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding or alternative dispute resolution mechanism, whether civil, criminal or investigative, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee was a director, officer, employee, trustee or agent (including a fiduciary) of the Company (or served in any of said other capacities), the Company shall purchase and maintain in effect for the benefit of the Indemnitee one or more valid, binding and enforceable policy or policies of D&O Insurance providing coverage in such amounts as is deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors.
'
(b)
The Company shall not be required to maintain said policy or policies of D&O Insurance in effect if, in the reasonable business judgment of the then directors of the Company (i) the premium cost for such insurance is substantially disproportionate to the amount of coverage, (ii) the coverage provided by such insurance is so limited by exclusions or otherwise that there is insufficient benefit from such insurance or (iii) said insurance is not otherwise reasonably available; provided, however, that in the event the then directors make such a judgment, the Company shall purchase and maintain in force a policy or policies of D&O Insurance in the amount and with such coverage as the then directors determine to be reasonably available.  In the event that the directors shall determine that a policy or policies of D&O Insurance are not reasonably available, the Company shall promptly notify Indemnitee of such determination.
(c)
To the extent the Company maintains D&O Insurance applicable to directors, officers, employees or agents (including fiduciaries), the Indemnitee shall be covered by such policies in such a manner as to provide the Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are accorded to the most favorably insured of the Companys directors, officers, employees or agents (including fiduciaries).
'
10.
.  (a)  The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Companys Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then, with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification and payment under this Agreement or any other agreement or under the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or under State Statutes, Independent Legal Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to, among other things, render a written opinion to the Company and the Indemnitee as to whether and to what extent the Indemnitee would be entitled to be indemnifi ed.  The Company agrees to abide by such opinion, to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Legal Counsel and to fully indemnify such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant thereto.
