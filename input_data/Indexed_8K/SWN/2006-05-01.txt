NEWS RELEASE
 
Houston, Texas  May 1, 2006...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2006. Highlights include:
Record earnings of $58.4 million, up 79% from the same period in 2005
Record net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $125.4 million, up 70% from the same period in 2005
Natural gas and crude oil production of 15.9 Bcfe, up 14% over the same period in 2005
Capital investments of $166.5 million more than doubled over the prior year period                  
For the first quarter of 2006, Southwestern reported net income of $58.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, up from $32.6 million, or $0.22* per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below), was $125.4 million in the first quarter of 2006, up from $73.6 million the same period in 2005. Strong commodity prices and a 14% increase in production volumes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses, drove the improved financial results.
"We've had a very good start to 2006," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "We set new quarterly records for net income and cash flow, primarily due to higher production from our development drilling programs in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin and higher commodity prices. In addition, our activity in the Fayetteville Shale play is accelerating as more rigs are being delivered in the area. Through the rest of 2006, we plan to test several new pilot areas as we continue to define the productivity of our acreage position."
* Adjusted to reflect the company's two two-for-one stock splits during 2005.
First Quarter of 2006 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $80.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006, up from $47.7 million for the same period in 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher realized natural gas and oil prices and increased production volumes, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.  
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 15.9 Bcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2006, up 14% compared to 14.0 Bcfe in the first quarter of 2005. The increase in production resulted primarily from increased production from the company's Overton Field in East Texas and increased production in the Arkoma Basin related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern's second quarter 2006 production guidance is 17.1 to 17.6 Bcfe.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $7.86 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $5.71 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2005. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price $0.26 per Mcf during the first quarter of 2006, primarily due to favorable basis hedges in place during the period. In the first quarter of 2005, the company's commodity hedging activities decreased its average gas price by $0.01 per Mcf. Assuming a NYMEX commodity price for 2006 of $8.00 per Mcf of gas, the company expects its differential for the average price received for its gas production for the calendar year 2006 to be approximately $0.60 to $0.70 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub index price, including the impact of its basis hedges. Within this guidance, Southwestern is currently estimating that its market differentials for the second quarter of 200 6 will be in the range of $0.50 to $0.60 per Mcf.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $56.80 per barrel, including the effect of hedges, during the first quarter of 2006 compared to $37.87 per barrel in the first quarter of 2005. The company's hedging activities lowered its average oil price $3.83 per barrel during the first quarter of 2006 and $9.67 per barrel during the same period in 2005.
Lease operating expenses per Mcfe for the company's E&P segment were $0.53 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $0.45 per Mcfe in the same period in 2005. The increase in lease operating expenses per Mcfe resulted from increases in gathering and compression costs. General and administrative expenses per Mcfe were $0.53 during the first quarter of 2006, compared with $0.39 for the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and other costs associated with the company's increased staffing levels. Southwestern added approximately 100 new employees during the first quarter of 2006, most of which were hired in the company's E&P segment. Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe were $0.33 during the first quarters of 2006 and 2005. The company's full cost pool amortization rate increased to $1.59 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2006, compared to $1.29 per Mcfe for the s ame period in 2005, primarily due to increased finding and development costs.
- Operating income for the company's natural gas distribution segment was $7.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006, up from $7.4 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in operating income for this segment primarily due to the effects of a $4.6 million annual rate increase implemented on October 31, 2005, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Weather during the
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
first quarter of 2006 in the utility's service territory was 18% warmer than normal and 7% warmer than the same period in the prior year.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas marketing and gathering activities, was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006, compared to $1.0 million in the same period in 2005.
Midstream Services
The company recorded pre-tax income from operations relating to the company's 25% interest in the Ozark Gas Transmission System of $0.9 million during the first quarter of 2006, compared to pre-tax income of $0.1 million for the same period in 2005. Southwestern also announced today that it entered into a sales agreement with Atlas Pipeline Partners LP. to sell its 25% minority interest in the NOARK Pipeline System Limited Partnership ("NOARK") for $69.0 million. NOARK operates the Ozark Gas Transmission system which extends through portions of the company's Fayetteville Shale play. In connection with the sale, Southwestern will directly assume $39.0 million of partnership debt related to its ownership interest in NOARK and for which it previously was, and still remains, the sole guarantor. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.  
Transportation and Other -
E&P Operations Review
Southwestern invested a total of $154.9 million in its E&P program during the first quarter of 2006, compared to $76.9 million in the first quarter of 2005. During the first quarter 2006 wells, the company participated in 84 wells, 17 of which were successful, none were dry and 67 were still in progress at March 31, 2006.
- In the first three months of 2006, Southwestern invested approximately $48.9 million in its Fayetteville Shale play, including $33.1 million to spud 38 wells and $9.3 million for leasehold. At May 1, 2006, the company held a total of approximately 880,000 net acres in the play area (including approximately 125,000 net acres held by conventional production).
Fayetteville Shale Play
As of May 1, 2006, Southwestern had spud a total of 148 wells in the play, 138 of which were operated by the company and 10 of which were outside-operated wells. The wells are located in 18 separate pilot areas located in 7 counties in Arkansas and, as of May 1, 2006, 72 were producing, 16 were in some stage of completion or waiting on pipeline hook-up and 7 were shut-in due to marginal performance or temporarily abandoned. The remaining 53 wells were in the drilling phase, including 44 horizontal wells which had been drilled through the vertical section with a smaller rig and will be re-entered with a larger rig capable of drilling the horizontal section. Gross production from the Fayetteville Shale play area was approximately 20 MMcf per day at May 1, 2006.
At May 1, 2006, 94 of the 148 wells spud are designated as horizontal wells, 27 of which were producing, 11 were completing, 9 were drilling, 3 were temporarily abandoned and 44 wells had been drilled through the vertical section. The average initial test rate for 25 of the 27 completed horizontal wells, excluding two horizontal wells which had mechanical
problems, is 2.0 MMcf per day. The company's average horizontal completed well cost was approximately $1.6 million per well in 2005, excluding non-recurring costs.  Due to additional larger stages in the company's slickwater fracture stimulations, Southwestern's average horizontal completed well cost for the first quarter of 2006 was approximately $1.8 million per well, excluding non-recurring costs.  These wells have taken 10 to 15 days on average to reach total depth after re-entering the wells with larger rigs.
As of May 1, 2006, Southwestern has seven drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, six of which are capable of drilling horizontal wells and one smaller rig is being used to drill the vertical section of the horizontal wells. Three of the ten new drilling rigs that the company contracted to buy in 2005 have been delivered and the remaining seven new rigs will be delivered throughout 2006 as each one is completed. In addition to the ten rigs previously contracted for, during the first quarter of 2006, Southwestern entered into an agreement to fabricate two smaller rigs which will be used to drill the vertical section of its horizontal wells. Including change orders, ancillary equipment and supplies, the total cost of the 12 rigs is approximately $105.5 million, $56.7 million of which had been paid as of March 31, 2006. The company expects to have 17 to 18 rigs drilling in the play area by year-end 2006.
The company continues to work to improve the fracture stimulation of these wells and, through May 1, 2006, Southwestern has performed 7 slickwater fracture stimulation treatments on horizontal wells. The average initial production test rate for these 7 wells was 1.4 MMcf per day and currently the wells are producing at an average of rate of 1.3 MMcf per day. One well of note was the Black #1-21-H well in the company's Scotland Field in Van Buren County. This horizontal well had a lateral length of approximately 2,600 feet and utilized a six-stage slickwater fracture stimulation treatment. The Black #1-21-H well had an initial production test rate of 2.0 MMcf per day and is currently producing 2.6 MMcf per day after being on production for 18 days.
The graph below provides average daily production data through April 30, 2006, for the company's horizontal wells drilled on acreage outside of that held by conventional production. The production data is compared to 1.3 Bcf and 1.5 Bcf type curves from the company's reservoir simulation shale gas model, excluding two wells which encountered mechanical problems. This graph also displays a composite curve showing results using slickwater fracture stimulation.
Through May 1, 2006, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission (AOGC) approved field rules for five fields in the Fayetteville Shale play area located in Conway, Van Buren, Cleburne and Faulkner counties. For each field, the AOGC approved governmental sections of approximately 640 acres as the drilling unit and well spacing requirements within each drilling unit of 560 feet minimum distance between completions in common sources of supply within the Fayetteville Shale formation, up to a maximum of 25 wells per drilling unit. Based on the assumptions contained in the field rule applications for these fields, Southwestern estimated the expected drainage from its horizontal wells to be less than 80 acres per well based on existing microseismic data and reservoir simulation modeling.
Southwestern expects to continue to evaluate its large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play by testing an additional 17 to 22 pilot areas during the remainder of 2006. The company expects to drill 175 to 200 wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area in 2006.
In February 2006, Southwestern announced that it had tested gas production from two vertical wells in the deeper Moorefield and Chattanooga Shales in the play area. The company's Carter #1-35 vertical well located in its East Cutthroat pilot area in Cleburne County, Arkansas, was completed in the Moorefield Shale and tested 710 Mcf per day. The company plans to drill its first horizontal well in the Moorefield Shale during the third quarter of 2006. Southwestern currently holds approximately 130,000 net undeveloped acres that could be prospective in the Moorefield Shale. The company also drilled a producing well in the Chattanooga Shale during the first quarter of 2006, the Eschbach #1-12 located in Franklin County, Arkansas, which tested at 316 Mcf per day. The company is continuing to
monitor this well's performance for possible future development of the Chattanooga Shale with horizontal wells.
- Southwestern participated in 12 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first quarter of 2006, including four wells at its Ranger Anticline area. The company also production tested the initial exploratory well in its Midway prospect, the USA #1-24, during the first quarter at 1.3 MMcf per day. The company expects the well will be placed on production in early May, and plans to drill two offset wells during the second and third quarters. Southwestern also drilled an additional exploration test, the USA #1-4, in the southern portion of its Midway prospect which encountered 97 feet of potential pay in the Basham interval at approximately 5,000 feet. This well is currently being completed. The company has approximately 20,300 gross undeveloped acres in its Midway prospect area.
Conventional Arkoma Program
- During the first quarter of 2006, Southwestern participated in 22 wells in East Texas, 20 of which were located in its Overton Field in Smith County, Texas. The company has experienced a 100% success rate at Overton since it began its development drilling program in 2001. Daily gross production at the Overton Field has increased from approximately 2.0 MMcfe in March 2001 to approximately 105 MMcfe at March 31, 2006. During the first quarter of 2006, the company acquired additional working interests in 60 wells from a private company in its South Overton farm-in area for $8.9 million. The acquisition of these interests also provides up to 29 potential additional future drilling locations which were excluded from the original farm-in agreement. In 2006, Southwestern plans to drill approximately 83 wells at Overton and South Overton.
East Texas
Southwestern currently holds approximately 28,000 gross undeveloped acres and 4,000 gross developed acres in its Angelina River Trend area located primarily in Nacogdoches County, Texas. During the first quarter of 2006, the company drilled two successful wells, bringing the total to 11 wells drilled in the area with 100% success. Southwestern intends to drill a total of 16 wells in the area during 2006.
- During 2005, Southwestern leased approximately 49,000 net undeveloped acres in the emerging Barnett Shale play in the Permian Basin in west Texas. Southwestern has secured a drilling rig and expects to spud two Barnett Shale tests in the second and third quarters of 2006.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by
operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
 
Southwestern will host a teleconference call on Tuesday, March 2, 2006, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern to discuss the company's first quarter 2006 financial and operating results.
