NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  October 23, 2006...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced that gross production from the company's wells in the Fayetteville Shale has now reached approximately 70 MMcf per day, up from approximately 50 MMcf per day at August 1, 2006 and is expected to increase to approximately 100 MMcf per day by year-end. The company currently has 14 rigs working in the play area, up from 10 rigs at July 31, 2006, and plans to have 19 rigs running in the play by year-end.
"Several positive events have occurred in the Fayetteville Shale play during the third quarter," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy.  "We have proven up more of the acreage, successfully testing an additional four pilot areas, one of which extends our productive region by approximately six miles to the northeast.  In addition, our horizontal wells continue to perform well."  
Southwestern announced today that it increased its projected capital investments for 2006 to $925.0 million, up approximately 11% from the $830.1 million capital program announced in December 2005.  The increased amount includes projected capital expenditures of $865.0 million for the company's E&P segment, up from approximately $770.3 million.  The increase is attributable to the company's Fayetteville Shale play and is primarily related to changes during the year in the company's fracture stimulation practices, higher service costs, increased outside-operated activity and costs related to previously disclosed purchases of land drilling rigs.  
Southwestern invested a total of $577.9 million in its E&P program during the first nine months of 2006, compared to $323.3 million in the first nine months of 2005.  During the first nine months of 2006, the company participated in 273 wells, 132 of which were successful, 134 were still in progress and seven were dry at September 30, 2006, for a 95% success rate through the first nine months of 2006.
- In the first nine months of 2006, Southwestern invested approximately $221.8 million in its Fayetteville Shale play, which includes $175.3 million to spud 142 wells, $22.2 million for leasehold, $5.2 million for seismic expenditures, and $19.1 million for other capitalized expenses.  Through October 19, 2006, Southwestern has drilled and completed a total of 128 wells in the Fayetteville Shale play, of which 76 are
Fayetteville Shale Play
designated as horizontal wells.  The wells are located in 25 separate pilot areas located in eight counties in Arkansas.  Of the 76 horizontal wells, 71 are currently producing.  In addition, 97 wells were in the drilling or completion phase at October 19, 2006, including 46 wells which had been drilled through the vertical section with a smaller rig and will be re-entered with a larger rig capable of drilling the horizontal section.  
Southwestern produced 3.8 Bcf in the third quarter from the Fayetteville Shale, up from 1.8 Bcf in the second quarter.  The company's gross production rate has now reached approximately 70 MMcf per day.  At October 19, 2006, the company had an inventory of 27 wells waiting on completion compared to 12 wells at July 31, 2006.  Southwestern currently has two completion crews operating in the area and has entered into supply arrangements with strategic partners to have up to five crews in the area by the end of the first quarter of 2007.  The graph below provides gross production data from the Fayetteville Shale play.
Earlier in the year, the company moved away from completing wells using nitrogen foam fracture stimulations in favor of larger slickwater and cross-linked gel stimulations, based upon the improved well performance experienced with those treatments.  Through October 19, 2006, the company had performed 49 slickwater or cross-linked gel fracture stimulation treatments on horizontal wells currently on production.  The average initial production test rate for these 49 wells was 1.7 MMcf per day.  The average rate for 42 wells that had been on production after 30 days was 1.5 MMcf per day and the average rate for 23 wells that had been on production after 90 days was 1.4 MMcf per day.  Current production information for the company's slickwater and cross-linked wells are as follows:
Costs of the company's recently completed slickwater horizontal wells have averaged approximately $2.2 million per well.  Southwestern has been able to mitigate a portion of the rising service costs through the utilization of its surface hole drilling program and increased efficiencies from its new fit-for-purpose drilling rigs.  The company's average horizontal well has a vertical depth of 3,700 feet and lateral length of 2,350 feet, and has recently taken 10 to 15 days on average to drill the horizontal section of the hole.
Horizontal wells recently completed using improved fracture stimulation techniques are displaying shallower initial decline rates, potentially pointing toward higher estimated ultimate recoveries.  The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through October 19, 2006, for the company's horizontal wells using improved fracture stimulation techniques compared to typecurves from the company's reservoir simulation shale gas model.  
  
As of October 19, 2006, Southwestern had 14 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 12 of which are capable of drilling horizontal wells and two smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical section of the horizontal wells.  The company expects five rigs to be delivered in the fourth quarter for a total of 19 rigs drilling in the play by year-end 2006, 15 of which will be able to drill horizontal wells.
In the second quarter of 2006, the company extended the play approximately 20 miles to the east with the drilling of the Hefley #1-12-H well located in White County.  This well was placed on production at approximately 1.6 MMcf per day in late-August.  In the third quarter, Southwestern successfully completed its first well in its Mako pilot area located approximately six miles northwest of the Hefley well.  The Johnson #1-16-H well encountered 486 feet of gross Fayetteville Shale pay and is currently flowing back after being fracture stimulated last week.  The company also extended the productive area of the play during the third quarter approximately six miles to the northeast with its Nicholson #1-16-H well located in its Hammerhead pilot area.  The Nicholson well encountered 562 feet of gross Fayetteville Shale play and is scheduled to be fracture stimulated next week.
During the third quarter, the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approved statewide field rules in the Fayetteville Shale, the Moorefield Shale and the Chattanooga Shale as "unconventional sources of supply."  Under the statewide rules each drilling unit would consist of a governmental section of approximately 640 acres and operators would be permitted to drill up to 16 wells per drilling unit for each unconventional source of supply.  Based on the assumptions contained in the field rule applications for these fields, Southwestern estimated the expected drainage from its horizontal wells to be less than 80 acres per well based on existing microseismic data and reservoir simulation modeling.  At October 19, 2006, the company held a total of approximately 887,000 net acres in the play area (including approximately 125,000 net acres held by conventional production).  By the
end of 2006, Southwestern expects to have effectively tested a substantial portion of its Fayetteville Shale acreage.
In February 2006, Southwestern announced that it had tested gas production from two vertical wells in the deeper Moorefield and Chattanooga Shales in the play area.  Southwestern's first horizontal test of the Moorefield, the Carter #2-35-H well in its East Cutthroat pilot area, was drilled during the third quarter and encountered 221 feet of gross Fayetteville Shale pay and an estimated 85 feet of gross Moorefield Shale pay based upon the offsetting vertical well.  This well is currently being completed in the Moorefield Shale.  Southwestern currently holds approximately 130,000 net undeveloped acres that could be prospective in the Moorefield Shale.  The company is also continuing to evaluate the possible future development of the Chattanooga Shale with horizontal wells.
- Southwestern invested approximately $68.9 million and spudded 56 wells in the first nine months of 2006 in its conventional Arkoma Basin program. The company currently has five rigs running in the conventional Arkoma Basin, all of which are drilling at its Ranger Anticline area in Yell and Logan Counties, Arkansas.  The company has completed 11 wells at Ranger during the first nine months of 2006, including potentially the company's best well in the area, the Smith #1-12, which was completed during the third quarter and is currently producing 5.5 MMcf per day after being on production for 64 days.  Southwestern plans to drill between 45 and 55 wells at Ranger in 2006.
Conventional Arkoma Program
In the company's Midway exploration area in Logan County, Arkansas, a total of five wells have been drilled to date.  Of those, two wells are producing and three wells are either being completed or waiting on pipeline.  The company holds approximately 28,650 gross acres in the Midway exploration area.
 
- Southwestern invested approximately $151.1 million in East Texas and spudded 61 wells during the first nine months of 2006.  Of these 61 wells, 54 were at its Overton Field and seven were located in the company's Angelina River Trend area.  The company currently has four rigs drilling at Overton with an additional rig in the Angelina River Trend, and expects to bring two company-owned drilling rigs into East Texas by the end of 2006.  The company continues to maintain a 100% success rate at both Overton and Angelina, and expects to drill a total of 85 wells in East Texas in 2006.  Of those 85 wells, 68 wells are planned at Overton and 17 wells are planned at Angelina.
East Texas
- Southwestern is performing completion operations on its first two wells in the emerging Barnett Shale play in the Permian Basin of West Texas, where it holds approximately 50,000 net acres.  The State Street State #701 vertical well located in the company's Popeye Prospect is currently shut-in for a pressure build-up test after testing non-commercial quantities of gas.  The Dela Minerals 3 State #701 vertical well in the company's deeper Coronado Prospect is currently being completed and preliminarily tested at an estimated rate of 2.1 MMcf per day over a shortened test period.  
Permian Basin
- In early October, Southwestern signed a purchase and sale agreement to divest its South Louisiana producing properties for an estimated $14.0 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.  Southwestern expects the transaction to be closed during
South Louisiana
the fourth quarter.  At year-end 2005, the properties had proved reserves of approximately 9.0 Bcfe. The company expects that the impact on its total production from the sale of these properties will be approximately 0.2 Bcfe during the fourth quarter of 2006.

NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  October 23, 2006..Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2006. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 19.3 Bcfe, up 19% over the same period in 2005
Record net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $95.2 million, up 19% from the same period in 2005
For the third quarter of 2006, Southwestern reported net income of $33.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $39.5 million, or $0.26* per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. In the third quarter of 2005, earnings included the net effect of a pre-tax gain of $8.7 million, or $0.04* per diluted share, relating to gains on future basis hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by a loss associated with hedge ineffectiveness. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below), was $95.2 million in the third quarter of 2006, up from $80.3 million in the same period of 2005. During the third quarter, the positive effect on the company's earnings of increased production volumes was offset by declines in realized commodity prices and increases in operating costs.
"As our drilling programs in East Texas and the conventional Arkoma Basin have continued their solid performance, our activities in the Fayetteville Shale play are expanding," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern. "We currently have 14 rigs running in the play area, and have tested four new pilot areas that provide additional data confirming the viability of an even larger portion of our sizeable acreage position. We also continue to be encouraged by the production performance of our horizontal wells. Despite the recent retreat in commodity prices, we remain positive about the long-term outlook for natural gas and believe that the low gas prices we experienced during the third quarter are not sustainable over an extended period of time."
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $128.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, up 30% from $98.9 million, or $0.65* per diluted share, for the same period in 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $304.8 million for the first nine months of 2006, up 39% from $219.0 million for the same period in 2005.
Third Quarter 2006 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $56.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006, down from $68.9 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in revenues resulting from the growth in production volumes was more than offset by increased operating costs and lower natural gas prices.  
E&P Segment
Southwestern's natural gas and crude oil production totaled 19.3 Bcfe for the three months ended September 30, 2006, up 19% from 16.2 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2005. The increase resulted primarily from increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play. Net production from the Fayetteville Shale was 3.8 Bcf in the third quarter of 2006, compared to 1.8 Bcf in the second quarter of 2006 and 0.7 Bcf in the third quarter of 2005.  With 14 rigs currently drilling in the Fayetteville Shale play, at October 19, 2006, the company has built its inventory of wells waiting on completion to 27 compared to 12 at July 31, 2006. Southwestern currently has two completion crews operating in the area and has entered into supply arrangements with strategic partners to have up to five crews in the area by the end of the first quarter of 2007.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.23 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $6.98 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2005. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price $0.19 per Mcf during the third quarter of 2006, compared to a decrease of $0.91 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2005. For the fourth quarter, the company has hedged approximately 60% to 65% of its expected gas production.
Assuming current NYMEX natural gas futures prices for the remainder of 2006, the company expects the average price received for its gas production for the fourth quarter of 2006 to be approximately $0.45 to $0.55 per Mcf below the NYMEX Henry Hub price.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $62.78 per barrel, including the effect of hedges, during the third quarter of 2006, compared to $47.23 per barrel in the third quarter of 2005. The company's hedging activities decreased its average oil price $5.53 per barrel during the third quarter of 2006 and $13.84 per barrel during the same period in 2005. For the fourth quarter, the company has hedged approximately 15% to 20% of its expected crude oil production.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment increased to $0.68 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $0.51 per Mcfe in the same period in 2005, primarily as a result of increases in gathering and compression costs. The majority of the increases primarily relate to the company's operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment were $0.54 per Mcfe during the third quarter of 2006, up from $0.42 per Mcfe for the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and other costs associated with increased staffing levels required to meet the demands of the company's expanding E&P operations, primarily related to developing the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern added 145 new employees during the third quarter of 2006, most of whom were hired in the company's E&P segment.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.32 per Mcfe during the third quarter of 2006, compared to $0.40 per Mcfe for the same period in 2005. The company's full cost pool amortization rate increased to $1.97 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $1.44 per Mcfe for the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased finding and development costs. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to the company's Fayetteville Shale play could materially impact the company's per unit costs going forward.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas marketing and gathering activities, was $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006, compared to $1.5 million in the same period in 2005.
Midstream Services
-The company's utility segment recorded a seasonal operating loss of $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2006, compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million for the same period in 2005. The decrease in operating income for this segment was primarily due to increased operating costs and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the effects of a $4.6 million annual rate increase effective October 31, 2005.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
On September 25, 2006, Arkansas Western Gas Company (AWG) filed with the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) a request for a change in its general rates and tariffs that would increase AWG's annual operating revenue by $13.1 million. The APSC has 10 months to review the filing, audit AWG's records, hold hearings and make a decision on the request. If the increase is approved, the rates are expected to take effect in July, 2007.
First Nine Months of 2006 Financial Results
 
- Operating income for the E&P segment was $186.6 million during the first nine months of 2006, compared to $165.2 million during the first nine months of 2005. The increase was primarily due to a 14% increase in production volumes combined with higher realized oil and gas prices.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production increased to 51.6 Bcfe for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, as compared to 45.2 Bcfe for the same period in 2005. The increase resulted primarily from increased production from the company's Fayetteville Shale play. Net production from the Fayetteville Shale was 6.3 Bcf in the first nine months of 2006, compared to 1.3 Bcfe for the same period in 2005. The company has lowered its production guidance for the fourth quarter of 2006 to a range of 20.4 Bcfe to 21.4 Bcfe and its full year guidance to a range of 72.0 to 73.0 Bcfe to reflect the current shortage of pressure pumping equipment and crews in the Arkoma Basin and the pending sale of the company's South Louisiana properties. The revised guidance represents an increase of 18% to 20% compared to 2005. Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.73 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first nine months of 20 06 compared to $6.16 per Mcf during the same period in 2005. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized during the first nine months of 2006 by $0.17 per Mcf, compared to a decrease of $0.58 per Mcf during the same period in 2005. Southwestern's average realized oil price was $60.24 per barrel for the first nine months of 2006, compared to $42.29 per barrel during the same period in 2005. The average realized oil
prices for the first nine months of 2006 and 2005 were reduced by $5.07 per barrel and $11.07 per barrel, respectively, due to the effects of the company's hedging activities.
Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first nine months of 2006 was approximately $0.89 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to the average for the prior year period of approximately $0.42 per Mcf. The change between periods was due to widening of the locational differences in the company's market prices for natural gas.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment were $0.62 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2006, up from $0.46 per Mcfe during the same period in 2005 as a result of increases in gathering and compression costs primarily related to the company's operations in the Fayetteville Shale play. Based on projected production, the company currently expects its unit operating costs for 2006 to range between $0.65 and $0.70 per Mcfe.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were $0.56 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2006, compared to $0.40 per Mcfe in the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased compensation and other costs associated with increased staffing levels to meet the demands of the company's expanding E&P operations, primarily related to developing the Fayetteville Shale play.  Southwestern added 389 new employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2006, most of which were hired in the company's E&P segment. Approximately 300 to 325 of the total new hires during 2006 are expected to be employed by Southwestern's new drilling company. Southwestern currently expects its per unit G&A expense for 2006 to range between $0.50 and $0.55 per Mcfe.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.34 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2006, compared to $0.35 per Mcfe during the same period in 2005. The company's full cost pool amortization rate increased to $1.79 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2006, compared to $1.37 per Mcfe for the same period in 2005, primarily due to increased finding and development costs. The company's amortization rate can vary from this estimate due to changes in the level of oil and gas reserves, production rates, costs associated with developing reserves, services costs and changes in the levels of unevaluated costs. Additionally, Southwestern's finding and development costs during 2006 are expected to be impacted by the timing and amount of the company's reserve bookings related to the Fayetteville Shale play.  
- Operating income for the company's natural gas marketing activities was $3.1 million during the first nine months of 2006, compared to $3.5 million in the same period in 2005. The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of increased staffing and operating costs associated with the company's gathering activities related to the Fayetteville Shale play.
Midstream Services
Operating income for Southwestern's utility was $1.3 million during the first nine months of 2006, down from $1.9 million during the first nine months of 2005. The decrease in operating income for this segment resulted primarily from warmer weather, increased operating costs and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the effects of a rate increase implemented in October 2005. Weather during the first nine months of 2006 was 21% warmer than normal and 11% warmer than the same period in 2005.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment -
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
 
Southwestern will host a teleconference call on Tuesday, October 24, 2006, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern to discuss the company's third quarter 2006 financial and operating results. The toll-free number to call is 800-289-0496 and the reservation number is 1068984. The teleconference can also be heard "live" on the Internet at
