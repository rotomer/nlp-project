NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  April 30, 2007...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2007. Highlights include:
Record oil and gas production of 22.9 Bcfe, up 44% over the first quarter of 2006
Earnings of $51.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted share
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $142.4 million
For the first quarter of 2007, Southwestern reported net income of $51.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $58.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below) was $142.4 million, up from $125.4 million in the first quarter of 2006. Results in the first quarter of 2007 were driven primarily by the positive effect on the company's earnings of a 44% increase in production which was offset by a 15% decline in realized natural gas prices and increased operating costs.
"We're very encouraged by our first quarter results," remarked Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "We set a new quarterly record for production, as our gross volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play increased to approximately 155 MMcf per day, up from approximately 20 MMcf per day this same time a year ago. With our significant land position and our increasing knowledge and technical skills in drilling and completing these wells, we believe we are well positioned for substantial multi-year growth in our production and reserves."
First Quarter of 2007 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $74.3 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared to $80.8 million for the first quarter of 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a 15% decline in realized natural gas prices and increased operating costs and expenses, which more than offset the effects of an increase in production.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 22.9 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2007, up from 15.9 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2006. The increase in production was due to production growth from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, which produced 8.2 Bcf during the first quarter of 2007 compared to 0.7 Bcf during the same period in 2006. Southwestern has revised its production guidance for the remainder of 2007 as follows:
 
 
Southwestern revised its total oil and gas production guidance for 2007 to 107.0 to 110.0 Bcfe, an increase of 48% to 52% over its 2006 production, of which approximately 47.0 to 50.0 Bcf is expected to come from the Fayetteville Shale.
For the first quarter of 2007, Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.71 per Mcf, including the positive effect of hedges, down 15% from $7.86 per Mcf in the first quarter of 2006. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $0.52 per Mcf during the first quarter of 2007 and increased its average gas price by $0.26 per Mcf during the same period in 2006. Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the first quarter of 2007 was approximately $0.58 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $1.35 per Mcf lower during the first quarter of 2006.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $55.17 per barrel in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $56.80 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006, including the effect of hedges. The company had no oil hedges in place during the first quarter of 2007. The company's hedging activities decreased its average oil price by $3.83 per barrel in the first quarter of 2006.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production were $0.74 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $0.53 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in lease operating expenses per unit of production was primarily a result of increased gathering and compression costs related to the company's operations in the Fayetteville Shale play. The company expects its average per unit lease operating cost to range between $0.82 and $0.87 per Mcfe during 2007.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were $0.47 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $0.53 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in general and administrative costs per unit of production was primarily due to the effect of increased production volumes. During the first quarter, Southwestern added 97 new employees and expects to hire approximately 75 additional employees during the remainder of the year. Southwestern expects its average general and administrative expense per unit of production to range between $0.41 and $0.46 per Mcfe in 2007.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.27 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $0.33 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2006, due primarily to the effects of lower gas and oil prices and the changing mix of production. Assuming average NYMEX prices of $7.00 per Mcf of gas and $60.00 per barrel of oil, the company expects taxes other than income taxes to range between $0.21 to $0.26 per unit of production.
 
The company's full cost pool amortization rate per unit of production increased to $2.24 per Mcfe in the first quarter of 2007 and is expected to range between $2.20 and $2.40 per
 
 
Mcfe for the year. The company's amortization rate can vary due to changes in the level of oil and gas reserves, production rates, costs associated with developing reserves, services costs and changes in the levels of unevaluated costs. The timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to the company's Fayetteville Shale play could materially impact the company's per unit costs going forward.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas marketing and gathering activities, was at approximately breakeven in the first quarter of 2007, compared to operating income of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in operating income was due to increased operating costs and expenses for the company's gas gathering activities due in part to timing differences, and a decrease in the margin generated by its gas marketing activities.
Midstream Services
- Operating income for the company's natural gas distribution segment was $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. The increase in operating income was due primarily to the increase in volumes delivered as weather during the first quarter of 2007 in the utility's service territory was 7% colder than the prior year but still 11% warmer than normal.
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
E&P Operations Review
Southwestern invested a total of $301.2 million in its E&P program during the first quarter of 2007, compared to $154.9 million in the first quarter of 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, the company participated in drilling 129 wells, 53 of which were producers, 3 were dry and 73 were in progress at March 31, 2007. Of the 73 wells in progress, 50 were in the company's Fayetteville Shale play.
- - As of April 30, 2007, Southwestern had drilled and completed a total of 263 wells in the Fayetteville Shale play, of which 208 were horizontal. Of the 208 horizontal wells, 181 wells were fracture stimulated using slickwater or crosslinked gel fluids. The wells are located in 33 separate pilot areas in eight counties in Arkansas. The map below identifies the company's current pilot areas. At April 30, 2007, the company was producing gas over an area which encompasses approximately 47% of its net acreage in the play area.
Fayetteville Shale Play
 
 
 
At April 30, 2007, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play area was approximately 155 MMcf per day, including approximately 9 MMcf per day from conventional production in four pilot areas. The company currently has 20 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 15 of which are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 5 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical section of the wells. Southwestern added a third completion crew during the first quarter which allowed the company to reduce its inventory of wells waiting on completion and the three crews are currently keeping pace with the company's drilling operations. The graph below provides gross production data from the Fayetteville Shale play.
In the first quarter of 2007, the company drilled and completed 68 wells in the Fayetteville Shale. The wells drilled ranged in total vertical depth from approximately 1,900 to 5,500 feet with horizontal sections that averaged approximately 2,100 feet. During the first quarter, the time to drill to total depth averaged 20 days from re-entry to re-entry, compared to a target of approximately 15 days. As a result, the company drilled fewer wells than planned during the first quarter. Average completed well costs during the quarter were $2.6 million, with costs ranging from an average of approximately $2.0 million to $3.3 million per well depending upon the pilot area and depth of the Fayetteville Shale. The company is currently drilling longer laterals in some of its pilot areas, which is expected to increase its drilling days and well costs for these wells.
Based on activity in the first quarter, the company may drill fewer wells than originally planned in 2007, but with longer average lateral lengths. The total number of wells drilled will also depend on other factors including the number of wells operated by others, the company's drilling time performance on individual wells, and total vertical depths related to the areas in which the company is drilling.
 
The company continues to utilize a mix of completion types across the area including conventional cemented liners and open-hole packers systems, along with combinations of
 
 
slickwater, crosslinked gel and hybrid frac fluid systems. Production tests during the first quarter have varied from 200 Mcf per day to 3.4 MMcf per day.
In its East Cutthroat pilot area, the company has experienced lower than average well performance. Initial wells were completed with crosslinked gel fracs and further testing with slickwater and longer laterals is planned. This pilot is located within the area where the Moorefield Shale and conventional reservoirs are believed to be prospective. The company plans to drill up to seven test wells in the Moorefield Shale during 2007. Further east of this area, the company has completed average and above average wells at its Bull and Sharkey pilot areas using slickwater systems. The Reaper #1-12H in the Bull pilot area, located in the southeastern part of the company's acreage, tested at 3.3 MMcf per day with a lateral length of 1,950 feet. In the company's Sharkey pilot area located in the eastern end of its acreage, the Wood Lumber #1-10H well was recently completed with an initial potential of 3.0 MMcf per day with a lateral length of 2,800 feet.
Gross daily production data for all of the company's wells that have been fracture-stimulated using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids through April 22, 2007, are as follows:
 
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through April 22, 2007, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "light blue" curve includes all wells, and the "dark blue" curve excludes 11 wells which had significant mechanical issues that are negatively impacting the wells' production performance. The normalized production curves provide a qualitative measure of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 1.3 and 1.5 Bcf typecurves shown on the graph reflect the range of the company's current estimates of the expected performance of an average horizontal well completed in the Fayetteville Shale with either a slickwater or crosslinked gel fracture stimulation and are based on the limited production history currently available.
 
 
 
During 2005 and 2006, the company acquired approximately 50 square miles of 3-D seismic data in the Fayetteville Shale play area. Results to date indicate that 3-D seismic data has the potential to optimize well performance, minimize geologic risk, better guide lateral length drilling and help find conventional targets. The company plans to acquire up to 350 additional square miles of 3-D seismic data during 2007.
At April 30, 2007, the company held approximately 896,000 net acres in the Fayetteville Shale play area (703,000 net undeveloped acres, 68,000 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale production and approximately 125,000 net acres held by conventional production).
- Southwestern participated in drilling 30 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first quarter of 2007, including 20 wells at its Ranger Anticline area. Several wells were placed on production during the first quarter at the company's Ranger Anticline and Midway prospect areas, resulting in production of 5.5 Bcf from the company's conventional assets in the Arkoma Basin up from 4.8 Bcf during the same period in 2006.
Conventional Arkoma Program
- During the first quarter of 2007, Southwestern participated in drilling 17 wells in East Texas, 14 of which were located in its Overton Field in Smith County, Texas. All of these wells were either productive or in progress at March 31, 2007. Production from the company's drilling activities in East Texas decreased to 7.6 Bcfe during the first quarter of 2007 compared to 8.1 Bcfe during the same period in 2006 primarily due to the reduction in the company's drilling activity at the Overton Field.
East Texas
At March 31, 2007, Southwestern held approximately 77,200 gross acres in its Angelina River Trend area located primarily in Angelina and Nacogdoches Counties, Texas. The company drilled three wells during the quarter at Angelina, all of which were productive.
 
 
During 2007, Southwestern plans to drill approximately 39 wells at Overton and approximately 29 wells in the Angelina River Trend area.
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
 
Southwestern will host a teleconference call on Tuesday, May 1, 2007, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern to discuss the company's first quarter financial and operating results. The toll-free number to call is 800-289-0572 and the reservation number is 8768451. The teleconference can also be heard "live" on the Internet at http://www.swn.com.
