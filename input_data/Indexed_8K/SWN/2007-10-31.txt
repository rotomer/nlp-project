NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  October 31, 2007Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2007. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 30.0 Bcfe, up 56% over the same period in 2006
Earnings of $51.0 million, up 52% from the same period in 2006
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $157.7 million, up 66% from the same period in 2006
For the third quarter of 2007, Southwestern reported net income of $51.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, up from $33.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), was $157.7 million for the third quarter of 2007, up from $95.2 million for the same period in 2006. The company's third quarter comparative financial results were driven primarily by the positive effect on earnings of the significant growth in production volumes from Southwestern's Fayetteville Shale play and higher realized natural gas prices which were primarily the result of the positive effects of the company's commodity hedging program.
"We continue to see improving results across our organization," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern. "In our Fayetteville Shale play, we are drilling better wells than we were a few months ago. Production volumes have followed suit, with our gross operated daily production from the Fayetteville Shale rising to approximately 260 MMcf per day at October 22, up from approximately 200 MMcf per day at the end of July. In addition, we continue to see strong results from our conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program and we remain very active in East Texas."
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 was $149.5 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, up from $128.9 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for the same period in 2006. Net income for the first nine months of 2006 included an after-tax gain of $6.7 million ($0.04 per share) related to the disposition of the company's 25% interest in the NOARK Pipeline System, Limited Partnership. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below) was $446.9 million for the first nine months of 2007, up from $304.8 million for the same period
in 2006.
Third Quarter 2007 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $88.9 million for the third quarter of 2007, up 58% from $56.3 million for the third quarter of 2006. The increase in revenues resulting from the growth in production volumes was partially offset by increased operating costs.  
E&P Segment
Southwestern's natural gas and crude oil production totaled 30.0 Bcfe for the third quarter of 2007, up 56% from 19.3 Bcfe for the third quarter of 2006. The increase resulted from increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play which totaled 14.7 Bcf for the third quarter of 2007, compared to 3.8 Bcf for the third quarter of 2006.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.66 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2007, including the effect of hedges, compared to $6.23 per Mcf for the third quarter of 2006. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $1.17 per Mcf during the third quarter of 2007, compared to an increase of $0.19 per Mcf during the third quarter of 2006. For the fourth quarter of 2007, the company has hedged approximately 70% to 75% of its expected gas production (11.5 Bcf hedged with fixed price swaps at an average price of $8.09 per Mcf and 10.5 Bcf hedged through price collars with an average floor price of $7.10 per Mcf and an average ceiling price of $11.21 per Mcf). Assuming current NYMEX natural gas futures prices for the remainder of 2007, the company expects the basis differential for its gas production for the fourth quarter of 2007 to be approximately $0.60 to $0.70 per Mc f below the NYMEX Henry Hub price.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $72.52 per barrel for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $62.78 per barrel, including the effect of hedges, for the third quarter of 2006. For calendar year 2007, the company has not hedged any of its expected crude oil production.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.67 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2007, down from $0.68 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006. The decrease was due to a decrease in the cost of fuel gas for compression-related expenses, partially offset by increases in gathering costs, both primarily related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play.
General and administrative expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.46 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $0.54 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006. The decrease was due to increased production volumes which more than offset increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play.
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.11 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $0.32 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006, primarily due to the changing mix of production. The company's full cost pool amortization rate was $2.56 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2007, compared to $1.97 per Mcfe for the third quarter of 2006. The higher
rate was due to increased capital investments and future development costs relative to the timing of reserve additions, including revisions.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2007, up from $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased gathering revenues from the company's operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.
Midstream Services
- The company's natural gas distribution business recorded a seasonal operating loss of $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2007, compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2006. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses and the effects of a $5.8 million annual rate increase which became effective August 1, 2007.

First Nine Months of 2007 Financial Results
 
- Operating income for the E&P segment was $244.5 million for the first nine months of 2007, up from $186.6 million for the first nine months of 2006. The increase was primarily due to a 53% increase in production volumes.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 78.7 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2007, compared to 51.6 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2006. The increase was due to increased production from the company's Fayetteville Shale play. Net production from the company's Fayetteville Shale play was 33.6 Bcf for the first nine months of 2007, compared to 6.3 Bcf for the first nine months of 2006.
The company's previous production guidance range for the full year 2007 was 107 to 110 Bcfe. The company currently expects its 2007 production to be approximately 111 Bcfe, up approximately 54% from 2006 production levels. Of the total, approximately 51 Bcf is expected to come from the Fayetteville Shale.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $6.75 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, for the first nine months of 2007 compared to $6.73 per Mcf for the first nine months of 2006. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized for the first nine months of 2007 by $0.62 per Mcf, compared to an increase of $0.17 per Mcf for the first nine months of 2006. Southwestern's average realized oil price was $62.58 per barrel for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $60.24 per barrel, including the effect of hedges, for the first nine months of 2006.
Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production for the first nine months of 2007 was approximately $0.70 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to the average for the prior year period of approximately $0.89 per Mcf. The change between periods was due to decreased basis differentials across the company's production areas.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.71 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $0.62 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2006. The increase was due to increases in gathering and compression costs, the majority of
which relate to the company's operations in the Fayetteville Shale play. Based on projected production, the company currently expects per unit operating costs for 2007 to be approximately $0.75 per Mcfe.
General and administrative expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.47 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $0.56 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2006. The decrease was due to increased production volumes which more than offset increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern added approximately 200 new employees during the first nine months of 2007, most of whom were hired in the company's E&P segment. Southwestern currently expects per unit G&A expenses for 2007 to be approximately $0.47 per Mcfe.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.19 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $0.34 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2006. The company's full cost pool amortization rate was $2.41 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2007, up from $1.79 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2006, due to increased capital investments and future development costs relative to reserve additions, including revisions.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment was $6.4 million for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $3.1 million for the first nine months of 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increases in gathering revenues from the Fayetteville Shale play.
Midstream Services
Operating income for Southwestern's natural gas distribution business was $4.1 million for the first nine months of 2007, compared to $1.3 million for the first nine months of 2006. The increase in operating income resulted primarily from increased volumes delivered due to colder weather, the effects of a $5.8 million annual rate increase which became effective August 1, 2007, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses. Weather during the first nine months of 2007 was 8% warmer than normal but 13% colder than the first nine months of 2006.

First Nine Months of 2007 Operating Results
Southwestern invested a total of $1.1 billion in its E&P program during the first nine months of 2007, compared to $578 million in the first nine months of 2006. During the first nine months of 2007, the company participated in drilling 476 wells, 287 of which were successful, 179 were still in progress and 10 were dry at September 30, 2007, for a 97% success rate through the first nine months of 2007. The company is currently projecting capital investments for 2007 of $1,455 million, including approximately $1,335 million related to the company's E&P segment.
- In the first nine months of 2007, Southwestern's E&P segment invested approximately $731 million in its Fayetteville Shale play and placed 187 wells on production. Through September 30, 2007, Southwestern has now drilled and completed a total of 392 operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play, of which 334 are horizontal wells. The wells are located in 35 separate pilot areas located in eight counties in Arkansas. Of the 334 horizontal wells, 290 wells have been fracture stimulated using slickwater or
Fayetteville Shale Play
crosslinked gel fluids. In addition, 92 wells were in the drilling or completion phase at September 30, 2007. The company currently has 19 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 15 that are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 4 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical section of the wells.
At October 22, 2007, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately 260 MMcf per day, including approximately 16 MMcf per day from eight wells producing from conventional reservoirs in six pilot areas located in four counties. At October 22, 2007, the company's net production from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately 194 MMcf per day. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area.
Approximately 10% of the production at October 22, 2007, was from three of the company's easternmost pilot areas (Sharkey, Hammerhead, and Mako) located in White County. Production increases in these three pilot areas alone account for approximately 28% of the 60 MMcf per day increase in gross operated production since the end of July. Within the last 35 days, the company has placed two wells on production with initial production rates of over 5 MMcf per day. The Poole #1-15H well, located in the company's Sharkey pilot area, was fracture stimulated using a slickwater fluid system along a 2,949 feet horizontal lateral section and placed on production at a rate of 5.2 MMcf per day. The Featherston #1-22 well, also located in the Sharkey pilot area, was fracture stimulated using an open-hole packer slickwater system along a 2,946 feet long horizontal lateral section and was placed on production at a rate of 5 .4 MMcf per day, which is the highest initial rate of any Fayetteville Shale well the company has put on production to date.
During the third quarter of 2007, the company focused the majority of its Fayetteville Shale drilling activity in the areas that have been identified as better performing to date and, where possible, in areas with 3-D seismic coverage. As of September 30, 2007, the
company had acquired or purchased a total of approximately 320 square miles of 3-D data in the Fayetteville Shale area and currently expects to have acquired or purchased approximately 450 square miles of 3-D seismic data by year-end. During the second quarter, the company also shifted to completing the majority of its wells using slickwater stimulations. Results from the company's 2007 drilling activities are as follows:
 
SW  Slickwater fluids
XL  Crosslinked gel fluids
Hy-RHy  Hybrid or Reverse Hybrid method (combination slickwater/crosslinked gel fluid system)
During the third quarter, the company's typical horizontal well had an average completed well cost of $3.0 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 2,613 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 16 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to average completed well costs during the second quarter of 2007 of $2.9 million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 2,497 feet and an average time to drill to total depth of 18 days from re-entry to re-entry. As the company continues to drill wells with longer laterals in some of its pilot areas, the number of drilling days and well costs may increase.
Southwestern has drilled and completed 24 slickwater wells with lateral lengths over 3,000 feet through September 30, 2007. Southwestern forecasts that the average gross ultimate recovery from wells with greater than 3,000 feet horizontal laterals to range from 2.0 to 2.5 Bcf per well. Below are the results from these wells:
 
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through September 30, 2007, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue" curve is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid systems and excludes 18 wells which had significant mechanical issues that are negatively impacting the wells' production performance. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's slickwater wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet. The normalized production curves provide a qualitative measure of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf typecurves are shown for reference purposes.
The company currently expects that it will invest approximately $1.0 billion (including capital investments related to gathering) in the Fayetteville Shale project area during 2007 and participate in approximately 400 horizontal wells, of which approximately 70% are expected to be operated by Southwestern. The total number of wells in which the company will participate will depend on several factors including the number of wells operated by others, the company's drilling time performance on individual wells, total vertical depths related to the areas in which the company is drilling as well as average horizontal lateral lengths.
At September 30, 2007, the company held approximately 902,000 net acres in the Fayetteville Shale play area (667,000 net undeveloped acres, 110,000 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale production and approximately 125,000 net acres held by conventional production).
- (Outside the Fayetteville Shale play area) Southwestern participated in drilling 85 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first nine months of 2007, including 44 wells at its Ranger Anticline area and 21 wells at its Midway area, resulting in production of 17.8 Bcf for the first nine months of 2007, compared to 14.6 Bcf for the first nine months of 2006.  
Conventional Arkoma Program
- Southwestern participated in drilling 64 wells in East Texas during the first nine months of 2007, 35 of which were located in its Overton Field in Smith County, Texas. All of these wells were either productive or in progress at September 30, 2007. Production from the company's East Texas properties was 22.7 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2007, compared to 24.1 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2006.
East Texas
At September 30, 2007, Southwestern held approximately 80,000 gross acres in its Angelina River Trend area located primarily in Angelina, Nacogdoches and San Augustine Counties, Texas. The company drilled 25 wells in the Angelina River Trend area during the first nine months of 2007, all of which were either productive or in progress at September 30. For calendar year 2007, Southwestern plans to drill approximately 43 wells at Overton, approximately 33 wells in its Angelina River Trend area and 4 wells in other areas.
- Southwestern also announced that it has acquired approximately 70,000 net acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective. The company plans to begin drilling on this acreage in early 2008.
