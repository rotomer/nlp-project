Satisfaction of Claims; Unclaimed Benefits
9.6
.  To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects under and by the laws of the State of Texas.  If any provision is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof; instead, each provision shall be fully severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.
Governing Law and Severability
9.7
.  The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract between the Employer and any person or to be consideration for the employment of any person.  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Employer or to restrict the right of the Employer to discharge any person at any time, with or without cause, nor shall the Plan be deemed to give the Employee the right to require any person to remain in the employ of the Employer or to restrict any person's right to terminate his employment at any time.
