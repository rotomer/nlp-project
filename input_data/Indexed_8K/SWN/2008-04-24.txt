NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  April 24, 2008Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced record financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2008. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 39.1 Bcfe, up 71% over the same period in 2007
Earnings of $109.0 million, up 114% from the same period in 2007
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $283.7 million, up 99% from the same period in 2007
For the first quarter of 2008, Southwestern reported net income of $109.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, up from $51.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period in 2007 (restated for the company's two-for-one stock split effected on March 25, 2008). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), was $283.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, up from $142.4 million for the same period in 2007. The increase in the company's first quarter comparative financial results was driven primarily by the significant growth in production volumes from the Fayetteville Shale play and higher realized natural gas prices.
"We had a very active and productive first quarter," stated Harold M. Korell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern. "Our results in the Fayetteville Shale continue to improve, resulting in strong growth in our production volumes. Gross operated production from the Fayetteville Shale reached approximately 400 MMcf per day at April 14, up from approximately 155 MMcf per day a year ago. We have also begun to see the impact of our James Lime activity in East Texas. Overall, I am very pleased with our results and progress in our drilling programs and our strong financial position."
First Quarter 2008 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $165.7 million for the first quarter of 2008, up from $74.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher production and realized natural gas prices.
E&P Segment
Southwestern's natural gas and crude oil production totaled 39.1 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2008, up 71% from 22.9 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2007. The increase primarily resulted from increased production from the Fayetteville Shale play, which totaled 23.6 Bcf for the first quarter of 2008, up from 8.2 Bcf for the first quarter of 2007. Southwestern has revised its production guidance for the second quarter of 2008 to 41.5 to 42.5 Bcfe (up
 
from 36.0 to 37.0 Bcfe).
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $7.70 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2008, including the effect of hedges, compared to $6.71 per Mcf for the first quarter of 2007. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $0.24 per Mcf during the first quarter of 2008, compared to an increase of $0.52 per Mcf during the first quarter of 2007. Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the first quarter of 2008 was approximately $0.57 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.58 per Mcf lower during the first quarter of 2007.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $96.55 per barrel for the first quarter of 2008, up from $55.17 per barrel for the first quarter of 2007. For calendar year 2008, the company has not hedged any of its expected crude oil production.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.77 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $0.74 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to increased production from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, which has higher per unit operating costs than the company's other focus areas.
General and administrative expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.42 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $0.47 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of increased production volumes which more than offset increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern added 46 new employees during the first quarter of 2008, most of which were hired in its E&P segment.
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.16 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $0.27 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2007, due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that primarily result from the mix of the company's production volumes and the accrual of severance tax refunds related to the company's East Texas production.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate was $2.30 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $2.24 per Mcfe for the first quarter of 2007. The amortization rate is impacted by timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment was $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2008, up from approximately breakeven for the first quarter of 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher gathering revenues, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Midstream Services is currently gathering approximately 470 MMcf per day through 634 miles of gathering lines in the Fayetteville Shale play area, up from approximately 150 MMcf per day a year ago. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases.
Midstream Services
- Operating income for the company's natural gas
Natural Gas Distribution Business
 
distribution segment was $11.6 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2007. The increase in operating income was due to colder weather and the implementation of a rate increase which became effective August 1, 2007. Weather during the first quarter of 2008 in the utility's service territory was normal and 11% colder than the prior year.
E&P Operations Review
Southwestern invested a total of $376.5 million in its E&P program during the first quarter of 2008, compared to $301.2 million during the first quarter of 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, the company participated in drilling 169 wells, 52 of which were successful, 115 were still in progress and 2 were dry at March 31, 2008, for a 96% success rate. The company is currently projecting total capital investments for 2008 of approximately $1.46 billion, of which approximately $1.33 billion is related to the company's E&P segment.
- In the first quarter of 2008, Southwestern's E&P segment invested approximately $285 million in its Fayetteville Shale play and placed 76 operated horizontal wells on production. Through March 31, 2008, Southwestern has drilled and completed a total of 557 operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play, of which 493 are horizontal wells. Of the 493 horizontal wells, 446 wells were fractured stimulated using either slickwater or crosslinked gel stimulation treatments, or a combination thereof.
Fayetteville Shale Play
At April 14, 2008, the company's gross operated production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately 400 MMcf per day, including approximately 11 MMcf per day from 12 wells producing from conventional reservoirs and the company's net production was approximately 295 MMcf per day. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area.
During the first quarter of 2008, the company focused the majority of its Fayetteville Shale drilling activity in areas with 3-D seismic coverage. Results from the company's drilling activities in the first quarter of 2008, plus the previous four quarters, are as follows:
 
SW  Slickwater fluids
XL  Crosslinked gel fluids
Hy-RHy  Hybrid or Reverse Hybrid method (combination slickwater/crosslinked gel fluid system)
During the first quarter of 2008, the company's typical horizontal well had an average completed well cost of $2.9 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 3,285 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 15 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average horizontal lateral length of 3,120 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 15 days from re-entry to re-entry during the fourth quarter of 2007. As the company continues to drill wells with longer laterals in some of its pilot areas, the number of drilling days and well costs may increase.
In late 2007, Southwestern began a project to demonstrate the benefits of a full-scale development strategy in a 4-square mile area of its Southeast Rainbow pilot area in Conway County, Arkansas. At April 15, 2008, the company had spud 22 wells in the area, 21 of which have been drilled to total depth and all of which were drilled on multi-well pads. Of the 21 wells drilled to total depth, the average well spacing was 100 acres and the average completed lateral length was 3,100 feet. At this time, 14 wells have been fracture stimulated. Of these 14 wells, 10 wells have been production tested at an average rate of 2.6 MMcf per day and 4 are shut-in waiting on additional compression capacity that is currently being installed. The cost to drill and complete these 10 wells is approximately $2.6 million per well. By comparison, offset wells within a two-mile radius of this area had an average initial production rate of 2.4 MM cf per day and an average completed well cost of $2.8 million per well. The company expects that the remainder of the 22 wells will be fracture stimulated and placed on production by the end of the second quarter of 2008. Results from the pilot area will provide key information regarding expected finding and development costs on a full-scale development basis, optimal well spacing and recoveries, benefits of longer laterals, benefits of simul-fracing, optimal infrastructure designs and other improvements and efficiencies.
At March 31, 2008, Southwestern had drilled and completed 142 wells with lateral lengths over 3,000 feet. The company forecasts that the average gross ultimate recovery from wells with greater than 3,000 feet horizontal laterals to range from 2.0 to 2.5 Bcf per well with an average completed well cost of approximately $3.0 million per well. Below are the results from these wells:
 
 
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through March 31,
 
2008, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue" curve is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid systems and excludes 29 wells which had significant mechanical issues that are negatively impacting the wells' production performance. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's slickwater wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 Bcf typecurves are shown solely for reference purposes and are not intended to be projections of the performance of the company's wells.
 
At March 31, 2008, Southwestern held approximately 907,000 net acres in the play area (including approximately 125,400 net acres held by conventional production in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin and approximately 55,631 net acres that are to be sold pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement executed in April 2008).
- (Outside the Fayetteville Shale play area) Southwestern participated in drilling 26 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first quarter of 2008, including 15 wells at its Ranger Anticline area and five wells at its Midway area. Production from the conventional Arkoma was 5.9 Bcf for the first quarter of 2008, compared to 5.5 Bcf for the first quarter of 2007.
Conventional Arkoma Program
- Southwestern participated in drilling 14 wells in East Texas during the first quarter of 2008. Production from the company's East Texas properties was 8.1 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2008, compared to 7.6 Bcfe for the first quarter of 2007.
East Texas
At March 31, 2008, Southwestern held approximately 95,000 gross acres in its Angelina River Trend area, which consists of several separate development areas located primarily
 
in four different counties in East Texas where the company is targeting both the Travis Peak and James Lime formations. The company drilled 12 wells in the Angelina River Trend area during the first quarter of 2008, all of which were either productive or in progress at March 31, 2008. Southwestern is currently focusing its drilling activity in this area on the James Lime where it has four operated wells on production which had gross initial production rates ranging from 5.0 to 14.4 MMcf per day. The company is currently testing its fifth operated well targeting the James Lime. Southwestern's current net production from the James Lime is approximately 12 MMcf per day including production from five outside-operated wells. Due to the company's recent success in the James Lime, Southwestern now plans to participate in approximately 21 net wells in its Angelina River Trend area in calendar year 2008.
- Southwestern currently has approximately 100,000 net undeveloped acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective. The company has drilled and is currently completing its first vertical well on the acreage. Southwestern plans to drill at least two additional test wells on its acreage during the remainder of the year.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
