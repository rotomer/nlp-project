NEWS RELEASE
Houston, Texas  July 30, 2008...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2008. Highlights include:
Record production of 45.1 Bcfe, up 74% over the same period in 2007
Record earnings of $136.6 million, up 187% from the same period in 2007
Record net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) of $288.2 million, up 96% from the same period in 2007
For the second quarter of 2008, Southwestern reported net income of $136.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, up from $47.6 million, or $0.14* per diluted share, for the same period in 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) was $288.2 million in the second quarter of 2008, up from $146.8 million for the same period in 2007.
"We achieved record results in the second quarter, driven primarily by our production growth in the Fayetteville Shale and higher gas prices," stated Harold M. Korell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "Our knowledge of how to drill and complete wells in the shale is consistently improving. These improvements are clearly visible in our production rates which, as of July 1, reflected gross daily operated production volumes from the Fayetteville of approximately 500 MMcf, up from about 200 MMcf per day a year ago. We are also seeing good results from our activities in the James Lime play in East Texas and our conventional Arkoma Basin properties."  
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2008, was $245.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, up from $98.6 million, or $0.29* per diluted share, for the same period in 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) was $571.9 million for the first six months of 2008, up 98% from $289.2 million for the same period in 2007.
 
* Adjusted to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split effected in March 2008.
 
 
As of July 1, 2008, the company has completed the sale of, or has agreements to sell, assets resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion. In the second quarter, the company sold certain oil and gas leases, wells and gathering equipment in its Fayetteville Shale play for $518.3 million. Additionally, the company has sold or has agreements to sell all of its oil and gas properties in the Gulf Coast and the Permian Basin for approximately $250 million in the aggregate. Approximately $179 million of these proceeds will be received in the third quarter of 2008. Finally, the company announced that it had closed the previously announced sale of its utility, Arkansas Western Gas Company, to SourceGas, LLC for approximately $230 million, subject to post-closing adjustments.  
These sales impacted the company's second quarter results in several ways. First, the proceeds from the sales of the company's oil and gas assets were credited to the full cost pool, thus reducing its full cost pool amortization rate. Also, as a result of the tax gains related to the sales of its oil and gas properties that closed during the second quarter, the company recorded a current tax liability of approximately $47 million (all of which is related to alternative minimum tax). Southwestern also expects to record a gain on the sale of its utility assets of approximately $55 million during the third quarter of 2008.
Second Quarter 2008 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $215.1 million for the second quarter of 2008, up from $81.4 million for the same period in 2007. The increase was primarily due to a 74% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas prices.
E&P Segment
Southwestern's natural gas and crude oil production totaled 45.1 Bcfe for the second quarter of 2008, up from 25.8 Bcfe for the second quarter of 2007. The increase was primarily due to growth from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, which produced 29.6 Bcf in the second quarter of 2008, up from 23.6 Bcf in the first quarter of 2008 and 10.7 Bcf in the second quarter of 2007.
Southwestern has increased its production guidance for the remainder of 2008 as follows:
 
 
Southwestern revised its total oil and gas production guidance for 2008 to 181.0 to 185.0 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 60% over its 2007 oil and gas production. Of the 181.0 to 185.0 Bcfe of expected production in 2008, approximately 119.0 to 124.0 Bcf is expected to come from the Fayetteville Shale.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $8.17 per Mcf for the second quarter of 2008, including the effect of hedges, compared to $6.90 per Mcf for the second quarter of 2007. The company's commodity hedging activities decreased its average gas price by $1.83 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2008, compared to an increase of $0.07 per
 
 
 
Mcf during the second quarter of 2007. Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the second quarter of 2008 was approximately $0.92 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices.
Southwestern's average realized oil price was $122.26 per barrel for the second quarter of 2008, up from $61.72 per barrel for the second quarter of 2007. For calendar year 2008, the company has not hedged any of its expected crude oil production.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.95 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $0.73 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2007. The increase was driven by higher per unit costs associated with the company's Fayetteville Shale operations, including the impact of higher natural gas prices on the cost of compression fuel. Due to the rise in natural gas prices and the resulting higher expected compressor fuel costs, Southwestern now expects its per unit operating cost for this segment to range between $0.92 and $0.97 per Mcfe for 2008.
General and administrative expenses were $0.41 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $0.48 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of increased production volumes which more than offset increased incentive compensation, payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern added 69 new employees during the second quarter of 2008, most of which were hired in its E&P segment. Southwestern expects its cost per unit for general and administrative expenses in 2008 to range between $0.42 and $0.47 per Mcfe.
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.16 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $0.21 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2007, primarily due to the change in the mix of the company's production volumes and the accrual of severance tax refunds related to the company's East Texas production. Southwestern now expects taxes other than income taxes to range between $0.15 and $0.20 per Mcfe in 2008.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $2.01 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $2.41 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2007. The declines in the average amortization rates were the result of sales of oil and gas properties in the second quarter of 2008, the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool. The amortization rate is impacted by timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. The future full cost pool amortization rate cannot be predicted with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas marketing and gathering activities, was $15.0 million in the second quarter of 2008, up from $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Midstream Services is currently gathering approximately 600 MMcf
Midstream Services
 
 
per day through 736 miles of gathering lines in the Fayetteville Shale play area, up from approximately 224 MMcf per day a year ago. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases.
- The company's utility segment recorded a seasonal operating loss of $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2007. The decrease in operating loss was due to colder weather and the implementation of a rate increase which became effective in August 2007. Effective July 1, 2008, the company sold its utility, Arkansas Western Gas Company, to SourceGas, LLC for approximately $230 million, which amount is subject to post-closing adjustments. As a result of the sale of the utility, the company is no longer engaged in any natural gas distribution operations.  
Natural Gas Distribution Segment
 
First Six Months of 2008 Financial Results
 
- Operating income for the E&P segment was $380.8 million in the first six months of 2008, compared to $155.7 million in the first six months of 2007. The increase was primarily due to a 73% increase in production volumes and higher realized natural gas prices.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production was 84.1 Bcfe in the first six months of 2008, compared to 48.7 Bcfe in the first six months of 2007. The increase resulted primarily from increased production from the company's Fayetteville Shale play. Net production from the Fayetteville Shale was 53.2 Bcf in the first six months of 2008, compared to 18.9 Bcfe in the first six months of 2007.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $7.95 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first six months of 2008 compared to $6.81 per Mcf in the first six months of 2007. The company's hedging activities decreased the average gas price realized during the first six months of 2008 by $0.87 per Mcf, compared to an increase of $0.28 per Mcf during the first six months of 2007. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first six months of 2008 was approximately $0.66 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.63 per Mcf lower than NYMEX spot prices during the first six months of 2007. Southwestern's average realized oil price was $108.69 per barrel during the first six months of 2008, compared to $58.42 per barrel during the first six months of 2007.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.87 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008, compared to $0.73 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2007. The increase was due to increased gathering and compression costs, the majority of which relate to the company's Fayetteville Shale play.
General and administrative expenses were $0.42 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008, compared to $0.47 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2007. The decrease was primarily due to growth in the company's production volumes. Southwestern added 115 new employees in the first six months of 2008.
 
 
 
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.16 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2008, compared to $0.23 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2007, primarily due to the effects of a changing mix of production and the accrual of severance tax refunds related to the company's East Texas production.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $2.15 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008, compared to $2.33 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2007, primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of properties during the second quarter of 2008 that reduced the full cost pool.
- Operating income for the company's midstream activities was $25.2 million in the first six months of 2008, compared to $2.3 million in the first six months of 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities related to the Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
Midstream Services
Operating income for Southwestern's utility was $10.7 million in the first six months of 2008, compared to $7.7 million in the first six months of 2007. The increase in operating income resulted primarily from increases in volumes delivered due to colder weather and the implementation of a rate increase which became effective August 1, 2007. Weather during the first six months of 2008 was 4% colder than normal and 12% colder than the same period in 2007.

E&P Operations Review
Southwestern invested a total of $739.3 million in its E&P program during the first six months of 2008, compared to $670.3 million in the first half of 2007. During the first six months of 2008, the company participated in drilling 343 wells, of which 198 were producers, 3 were dry and 142 were in progress at June 30, 2008. Of the 142 wells in progress, 125 were in the company's Fayetteville Shale play.
- As of June 30, 2008, Southwestern had drilled and completed a total of 619 operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play, of which 554 were horizontal. Of the 554 horizontal wells, 507 wells have been fracture stimulated using slickwater or crosslinked gel fluids. The wells are located in 33 separate pilot areas in eight counties in Arkansas.
Fayetteville Shale
At July 1, 2008, the company's gross operated production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play area was approximately 500 MMcf per day, including approximately 12 MMcf per day from 14 wells producing from conventional reservoirs. The company currently has 22 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 15 that are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 7 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical section of the wells. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area.
 
 
 
 
For the remainder of 2008, the company plans to focus the majority of its Fayetteville Shale drilling activity where possible in areas with 3-D seismic coverage. Results from the company's drilling activities in the second quarter of 2008, plus the previous five quarters, are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SW  Slickwater fluids
XL  Crosslinked gel fluids
Hy-RHy  Hybrid or Reverse Hybrid method (combination slickwater/crosslinked gel fluid system)
Note: Data excludes wells which were sold in May 2008.
During the second quarter, the company's horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 3,562 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 14 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average completed well cost of $2.9 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 3,301 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 15 days from re-entry to re-entry during the first quarter of 2008. As the company continues to drill wells with longer laterals in some of its pilot areas, the number of drilling days and well costs may increase.
During the first half of 2008, the company began to test closer perforation cluster spacing in its horizontal wells with positive results. Southwestern has tested this technique on 38 of its wells and has seen a 15% to 20% improvement in early production over average initial
 
 
 
production of wells on which the company did not utilize this technique. Southwestern estimates that ultimate recovery on these wells could be improved by 15% to 20% and is currently planning to utilize this technique on all of its wells it plans to drill for the remainder of the year. Associated with this new completion technique and longer laterals, the company expects completed well costs to average approximately $3.0 million per well for the rest of 2008. Additionally in the second half of 2008, Southwestern plans to test the downspacing of wells at and below 80-acre spacing.
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through June 30, 2008, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue" curve is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid systems and excludes 28 wells which had significant mechanical issues that are negatively impacting the wells' production performance. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 Bcf typecurves are shown solely for reference purposes and are not intended to be projections of the performance of the company's wells.
 
 
 
At June 30, 2008, Southwestern held approximately 857,000 net acres in the play area, including approximately 125,400 net acres held by conventional production in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin.
- Southwestern participated in drilling 46 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first six months of 2008, including 21 wells at its
Conventional Arkoma
 
 
 
Ranger Anticline area, resulting in production of 11.9 Bcf during the first six months of 2008, compared to 11.5 Bcf for the first six months of 2007.
- During the first half of 2008, Southwestern participated in drilling 23 wells in East Texas, 12 of which were James Lime horizontal wells. Production from the company's East Texas properties was 16.0 Bcfe for the first six months of 2008, compared to 15.1 Bcfe for the same period last year.
East Texas
At June 30, 2008, Southwestern held approximately 102,000 gross acres in its Angelina River Trend area, which consists of several separate development areas located primarily in four different counties in East Texas where the company is targeting the Pettet, Travis Peak and James Lime formations. The company drilled 18 wells in the Angelina River Trend area during the first six months of 2008, all of which were either productive or in progress at June 30, 2008. Southwestern is currently focusing its drilling activity in this area on the James Lime formation where it has 9 operated wells on production which had average gross initial production rates of 8.0 MMcf per day. Southwestern's current net production from the James Lime is approximately 23 MMcf per day, including production from 5 outside-operated wells.
The company also announced the signing of a 50/50 joint venture agreement with a private company to drill two wells targeting the Haynesville/Bossier Shale intervals in Shelby and San Augustine Counties, Texas. A portion of the company's acreage in its Angelina River Trend area (approximately 41,500 gross acres) in Shelby, San Augustine and Nacogdoches Counties is included in the joint venture.
- Southwestern currently has approximately 105,000 net undeveloped acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective. The company has drilled its first two vertical wells on its acreage located in Bradford and Susquehanna Counties. The company expects to complete the wells during the third quarter. Southwestern plans to drill at least two additional test wells, one of which will be a horizontal well, on its acreage during the remainder of the year.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. The company has also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the company's financial information.
