Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)  On December 11, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Southwestern Energy Company (the "Company") approved the annual base salaries, cash incentive compensation award levels and long-term incentive compensation awards for fiscal year 2009 of the Company's executive officers after consideration and a review of a number of factors, including but not limited to performance, competitive market data and the recommendations of the Company's outside compensation consultants. The annual base salaries of the Company's Named Executive Officers as of January 1, 2008 and 2009 are set forth in the table below. The restricted stock and stock option awards under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan were granted to the Named Executive Officers on December 11, 2008.  Each of the restricted stock awards included a tax gross-up which was calculated based on $30.68, the closing price of the Company's common stock on December 10, 2008 and each of the restricted stock awards vests ratably over a period of four years.  The exercise price of the stock options is $30.68, the closing price of the Company's common stock on December 10, 2008, and each of the option awards vests ratably over a period of three years.  The table also sets forth the grants of performance units under the Company's 2002 Performance Unit Plan to the Named Executive Officers.  Each performance unit vests in three years and has a target value of $1,000.  The table also sets forth the target annual incentive award and the maximum total annual cash incentive award (i.e., assuming attainment of the maximum performance objectives and the maximum discretionary amount) as a percentage of base salary for 2009 for each Named Executive Officer under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan:
 
 
1  Any executive officer who elects to currently recognize income for federal tax purposes with respect to such shares will also receive a cash "tax" bonus, calculated using such officer's estimated tax rate, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the additional taxable income resulting from the tax bonus.
2  Includes a special award of 10,000 options granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
 
On December 11, 2008, based upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, and with the approval of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors granted each of the Company's non-employee directors (i) 5,270 non-qualified stock options, in accordance with the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and (ii) 1,600 shares of restricted stock in accordance with the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, accompanied by a grant of a cash "tax" bonus.  
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
