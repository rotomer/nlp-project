SECTION 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations
Item 1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 16, 2009, SEECO, Inc. ("SEECO"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southwestern Energy Company ("Southwestern"), amended and restated its Project Services Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Project Services Agreement") with Schlumberger Technology Corporation ("SLB") pursuant to which SEECO has agreed to utilize SLB for a specified percentage of its oilfield service requirements relating to Southwestern's Fayetteville Shale Play in Arkansas (the "Project"). The effective date of the Amended and Restated Project Services Agreement is January 1, 2009 and the agreement will expire two years from such date.
Subject to certain exceptions, during the term of the Amended and Restated Project Services Agreement, SEECO has agreed to utilize SLB for not less than fifty percent (50%) and, in SEECO' s sole discretion, up to sixty percent (60%) (as modified from time to time as contemplated in the Project Services Agreement, the "Utilization Percentages") of SEECO's total Project expenditures for each of the following: Cased Hole Logging services, Open Hole Logging services, Cementing services, Stimulation services, Coiled Tubing services, Data and Consulting services and Tubing Conveyed Perforating services.
In return for the foregoing contractual commitments from SEECO, SLB has agreed, among other things, to provide the Committed SLB Resources to SEECO as required to perform the services under the Amended and Restated Project Services Agreement on a priority basis and that all Oilfield Services provided to SEECO under the Amended and Restated Project Services Agreement shall receive competitive pricing based on the rates charged for such services to Midcontinent Basin customers. The priority of services to SEECO shall be determined based on the level of SEECO's commitment and expenditures as compared with the level of commitments and expenditures of other customers in the Midcontinent Basin, and SEECO shall receive priority treatment over all customers whose year-to-date commitment and expenditures are lower than those of SEECO. "Committed SLB Resources" means the personnel and/or equipment, including technical support, to be committed by SLB to the Project, which at a minimum shall be those reso urces which are reasonable and necessary to meet SEECO's requirements.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
