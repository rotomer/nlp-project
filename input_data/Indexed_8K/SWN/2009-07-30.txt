NEWS RELEASE  
Houston, Texas  July 30, 2009...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced its financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2009. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 74.3 Bcfe, up 65% over the same period in 2008
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $325.3 million (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below), up 13% from the same period in 2008
Net earnings of $121.1 million, compared to $136.6 million in the same period in 2008
For the second quarter of 2009, Southwestern reported net income of $121.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $136.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) was $325.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, up from $288.2 million for the same period in 2008.
"We continue to make significant progress in the development of our Fayetteville Shale play every quarter, and the second quarter was no exception," remarked Harold M. Korell, Executive Chairman of Southwestern Energy. "Our gross operated production from the Fayetteville Shale reached a significant milestone of 1 Bcf per day in July, compared to approximately 500 MMcf per day this time a year ago. The productivity of our wells also continues to improve as we learn more. While current gas prices remain low, we believe lower industry drilling activity will result in higher prices over the next 18 months. With our focus on value creation and a world-class resource to develop in the Fayetteville Shale, we are well-positioned not only to weather the current low commodity price environment with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, but also to benefit greatly when prices return to more normalized levels."
For the first six months of 2009, Southwestern reported a net loss of $311.7 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, which included a first quarter $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment ($558.3 million net of taxes) of the company's natural gas and oil properties resulting from lower natural gas prices. Excluding the non-cash impairment, Southwestern's net income for the first six months of 2009 was $246.6 million (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to net income of $245.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, in the same period in 2008.
 
 
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), was $697.9 million for the first six months of 2009, up 22% from $571.9 million for the same period in 2008. Excluding the non-cash impairment, the company's financial results have been impacted primarily by the significant growth in production volumes during the first six months of 2009, partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices.
Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $174.4 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to $215.1 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 39% decrease in realized natural gas prices and a 22% increase in operating costs and expenses, which was partially offset by a 65% increase in production volumes.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 74.3 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2009, up from 45.1 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2008, and included 60.6 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 29.6 Bcf in the second quarter of 2008. As a result of recent inspections, repairs and maintenance on the Fayetteville Lateral of the Texas Gas Transmission Pipeline (Boardwalk Pipeline), the company has experienced curtailments that have impacted its ability to transport its production from the Fayetteville Shale. Beginning in April 2009, Texas Gas reduced the capacity on, or shut down, the Fayetteville Lateral on several occasions due to various activities, including maintenance and pipeline inspection. These activities, as well as similar repairs to the Greenville Lateral, are expected to continue, resulting in future curtailments. Texas Gas has estimated that it will begin repairs and maintenance on the pipeline in September and that the repairs will be completed in one to five months.
Currently, the company's transportation capacity for its Fayetteville Shale production is sufficient for its wells at a gross operated rate of approximately 1,050 MMcf per day. Southwestern's net share of its gross operated capacity, together with production which is operated by other companies, is approximately 750 MMcf per day. Southwestern estimates that its total gross operated production will be curtailed to approximately 650 MMcf per day, or approximately 450 MMcf per day net, once the repairs to the Fayetteville Lateral Phase 1 facilities begin. In anticipation of these continued pipeline curtailments, Southwestern has revised its previous gas and oil production guidance range for 2009 from 289 to 292 Bcfe to 278 to 288 Bcfe, or approximately 45% over 2008 levels (using midpoints). Of the total 2009 targeted annual production, approximately 227 to 236 Bcf is expected to come from the Fayetteville Shale. This revised production guidance assumes curtailment of portions of the Fayetteville Lateral Phase 1 facilities for 45 to 60 days starting in September and total curtailed volumes for the remainder of the year of approximately 15 Bcf net to Southwestern. Southwestern's production guidance for the remainder of 2009 is shown below:
 
 
 
 
Including the effect of hedges, Southwestern's average realized gas price in the second quarter of 2009 was $5.01 per Mcf, down from $8.17 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2008. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $2.11 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2009, compared to a decrease of $1.83 per Mcf during the same period in 2008.
Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the second quarter of 2009 was approximately $0.60 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.92 per Mcf lower during the second quarter of 2008. The company believes that average basis differentials going forward will generally approximate those experienced in the second quarter of 2009, but will be volatile due to the Boardwalk Pipeline repairs discussed above. As of July 30, 2009, the company had protected approximately 50 Bcf of its third quarter 2009 expected gas production from the potential of widening basis differentials through hedging activities and sales arrangements at an average basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.35 per Mcf, excluding transportation charges and fuel charges. As of that same date for the fourth quarter of 2009, the company had protected approximately 30 Bcf at an average basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.35 per Mcf, excluding transportation and fuel charges. The company typically sells its natural gas at a discount to NYMEX spot prices due to locational basis differentials, transportation charges and fuel charges.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment were $0.73 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009, down from $0.95 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease primarily resulted from the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in the second quarter of 2009.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were $0.34 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009, down from $0.41 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the company's increased production volumes which more than offset increased compensation and related costs primarily associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.08 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $0.16 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of the company's production volumes combined with lower commodity prices.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $1.46 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009, compared to $2.01 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2008. The decline in the average amortization rate was primarily the result of the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The amortization rate is impacted by timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions,
 
 
 
 
 
revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, impairments that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. The future full cost pool amortization rate cannot be predicted with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas gathering and marketing activities, was $27.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, up from $15.0 million in the same period in 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gathering revenues from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. At June 30, 2009, the company's midstream segment was gathering approximately 1,060 MMcf per day through 960 miles of gathering lines in the Fayetteville Shale play area, up from approximately 600 MMcf per day a year ago. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases.
Midstream Services
First Six Months of 2009 Financial Results
 
Excluding the non-cash ceiling test impairment, operating income from the company's E&P segment was $354.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), compared to $380.8 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized natural gas prices and increased operating costs and expenses which were partially offset by higher production.
-
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production was 138.2 Bcfe in the first six months of 2009, compared to 84.1 Bcfe in the first six months of 2008, and included 110.8 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 53.2 Bcfe in the first six months of 2008.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $5.44 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first six months of 2009 compared to $7.95 per Mcf in the first six months of 2008. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized during the first six months of 2009 by $2.12 per Mcf, compared to a decrease of $0.87 per Mcf during the first six months of 2008. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first six months of 2009 was approximately $0.87 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.66 per Mcf lower than NYMEX spot prices during the first six months of 2008.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.76 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009, down from $0.87 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in the first six months of 2009.
General and administrative expenses were $0.32 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009, compared to $0.42 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the company's increased production volumes which more than offset increased compensation and related costs primarily associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play.
 
 
 
 
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.10 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2009, compared to $0.16 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2008, primarily due to the change in the mix of the company's production volumes combined with lower commodity prices.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $1.63 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009, compared to $2.15 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2008, primarily due to the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and the sale of natural gas and oil properties in 2008, as the proceeds were credited to the full cost pool.
- Operating income for the company's midstream activities was $55.2 million in the first six months of 2009, compared to $25.2 million in the first six months of 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities related to the Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
Midstream Services
- For the first six months of 2009, Southwestern invested a total of $959.4 million, compared to $825.4 million during the first six months of 2008, which included $852.5 million invested in its E&P business and $102.5 million invested in its Midstream Services activities. Of the $852.5 million invested in its E&P business, approximately $700.7 million was invested in its Fayetteville Shale play, $74.0 million in East Texas, $32.4 million in its conventional Arkoma Basin program and $31.8 million in New Ventures. The company expects that its total capital investments for the full year of 2009 to be approximately $1.8 billion.
Capital Investments
E&P Operations Review
- For the first six months of 2009, Southwestern placed a total of 231 operated wells on production in the Fayetteville Shale play, all of which were horizontal wells fracture stimulated using slickwater.
Fayetteville Shale Play
At June 30, 2009, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately 990 MMcf per day, up from approximately 500 MMcf per day a year ago. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area through June 30, 2009.
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the company's horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $2.9 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,123 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 11 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average completed well cost of $3.1 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 3,874 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry in the first quarter of 2009. The company currently has 17 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 13 that are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 4 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical portion of the wells. The company currently expects its gross well count in the play during 2009 to be approximately 575 wells (75% operated).
Since 2007, the continuous improvement of the company's completion practices have resulted in quarter-over-quarter improvements in average initial production rates of operated wells placed on production. Results from the company's drilling activities from 2007 through 2009, by quarter, are shown below.
 
 
 
 
Note: Results as of June 30, 2009.  
SW  Slickwater fluids
XL  Crosslinked gel fluids
Hy-RHy  Hybrid or Reverse Hybrid method (combination slickwater/crosslinked gel fluid system)
(1) The significant increase in the average initial production rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the subsequent decrease for the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflected the impact of the delay in the Boardwalk Pipeline.  Wells that were placed on production in January and February of 2009 had average initial production rates of 2,806 Mcf per day and 2,749 Mcf per day, respectively, while wells placed on production during March 2009 had average initial production rates of 3,353 Mcf per day.
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through June 30, 2009, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue curve" is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet, while the "purple curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 4,000 feet. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 Bcf typecurves are shown solely for reference purposes and are not intended to be projections of the performance of the company's wells.
 
 
 
 
 
 
At June 30, 2009, Southwestern held approximately 879,000 net acres in the play area (including 125,372 net acres in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin).
-In the second quarter of 2008, Southwestern signed a 50/50 joint venture agreement with a private company targeting the Haynesville/Bossier Shale intervals in Shelby and San Augustine Counties, Texas. The first horizontal well, the Red River 877 #1 located in Shelby County, reached total depth in the fourth quarter of 2008, was production tested at 7.2 MMcf per day in the first quarter of 2009 and is currently producing approximately 1.8 MMcf per day. The second horizontal well, the Red River 164 #1, was production tested at 13.4 MMcf per day in the second quarter of 2009 and is currently producing approximately 7.8 MMcf per day. The company has completed drilling a third well, the Red River 619 #1 well located in San Augustine County, and recently spud its fourth well, the Burrows Gas Unit #1-H.  Pending further results from these wells, the company may invest more capital in the Haynesville/Bossier Shale play than previously planned.  In total, Southwestern has approximately 32,800 net acres it believes is prospective for the Haynesville/Bossier Shale.
East Texas
Southwestern participated in drilling 23 wells in East Texas during the first six months of 2009, 21 of which were James Lime horizontal wells. The company currently has 28 operated James Lime horizontal wells on production which had average gross initial production rates of 10.1 MMcf per day. Southwestern's current net production from the James Lime is approximately 38.6 MMcf per day. Production from the company's East Texas properties was 15.6 Bcfe for the first six months of 2009, compared to 16.0 Bcfe for the first six months of 2008.
 
 
 
 
(Outside the Fayetteville Shale play area) Southwestern participated in drilling 13 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first six months of 2009. Production from the company's conventional Arkoma Basin was 11.6 Bcf for the first six months of 2009, compared to 11.9 Bcf for the first six months of 2008.  
Conventional Arkoma Program
-
- At June 30, 2009, Southwestern held approximately 160,500 net undeveloped acres in the United States outside of its core operating areas in connection with New Ventures, including approximately 138,300 net acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective.
New Ventures
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of our peers and of prior periods.  
One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.
Additional non-GAAP financial measures we may present from time to time are net income attributable to Southwestern Energy, diluted earnings per share attributable to Southwestern Energy stockholders and our E&P segment operating income, all which exclude certain charges or amounts.  Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
See the reconciliations below of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
