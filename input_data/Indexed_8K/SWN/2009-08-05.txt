(Slide 2) Forward-Looking Statements
All statements, other than historical financial information, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for Southwestern Energy Company's (the company) future operations, are forward-looking statements. Although the company believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The company has no obligation and makes no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect the company's operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause its actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward-looking statements, risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil (including regional basis differentials); the company's ability to transport its production to the most favorable markets or at all; the timing and extent of the company's success in discovering, developing, producing and estimating reserves; the economic viability of, and the company's success in drilling, the company's large acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale play, overall as well as relative to other productive shale gas plays; the company's ability to fund the company's planned capital investments; the company's ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the Fayetteville Shale formation; the impact of federal, state and local government regulation, including any increase in severance taxes; the costs and availability of oil field personnel services and drilling supplies, raw materials, and equipment and services; the company's future property acquisition or divestiture activities; increased competition; the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies; the comparative cost of alternative fuels; conditions in capital markets, changes in interest rates and the ability of the company's lenders to provide it with funds as agreed; credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by the company's counterparties and any other factors listed in the reports the company has filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For additional information with respect to certain of these and other factors, see the reports filed by the company with the SEC. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
The SEC has generally permitted oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved reserves that a company has demonstrated by actual production or conclusive formation tests to be economically and legally producible under existing economic and operating conditions. We use the terms "estimated ultimate recovery," "EUR," "probable," "possible," and "non-proven" reserves, reserve "potential" or "upside" or other descriptions of volumes of reserves potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that the SEC's guidelines may prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Net Cash Flow
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of our peers and of prior periods.  One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash flow.  Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.  These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
Note that the information contained on this slide constitutes a "Forward-Looking Statement".
(Slide 28) Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Adjusted Net Income
Additional non-GAAP financial measures we may present from time to time are net income attributable to Southwestern Energy and diluted earnings per share attributable to Southwestern Energy stockholders, both of which exclude certain charges or amounts.  Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items.  These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
The table below reconciles forecasted adjusted net income with GAAP net income for 2009, assuming various NYMEX price scenarios and the corresponding estimated impact on the company's results for 2009, including current hedges in place:

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: EBITDA
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Southwestern has included information concerning EBITDA because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure commonly used in the energy industry.  EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of the company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net income is a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles historical EBITDA with historical net income.
 
(1)Net income for the Midstream Services segment was $35,145, depreciation, depletion and amortization was $11,402, net interest expense was $6,059 and provision for income taxes was $21,278.
   
(2)    Net income (loss) includes the after-tax $558.3 million full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded in Q1 2009.
(3)    Provision (benefit) for income taxes includes the ($349.5) million income tax benefit related to the full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded in Q1 2009.
(4)    Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes the $907.8 million full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded in Q1 2009.
(5)    Provision for income taxes for 2003 includes the tax benefit associated with the cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle.
(6)2000 amounts exclude unusual items of $109.3 million for the Hales judgment and $2.0 million for other litigation.
   
 
The table below reconciles forecasted EBITDA with forecasted net income for 2009, assuming various NYMEX price scenarios and the corresponding estimated impact on the company's results for 2009, including current hedges in place:
 
(1)Midstream Services segment 2009 results assumes NYMEX commodity prices of $4.00 per Mcf for natural gas and $65.00 per barrel for crude oil.
   
(2)    Net income (loss) includes the after-tax full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties in Q1 2009.
(3)    Provision (benefit) for income taxes includes the income tax benefit related to the full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded in Q1 2009.
(4)    Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes the $907.8 million full cost ceiling impairment of our natural gas and oil properties recorded in Q1 2009.
