NEWS RELEASE  
Houston, Texas  October 29, 2009...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2009. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 73.2 Bcfe, up 38% over the same period in 2008
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $331.8 million (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below), up from $312.1 million in the same period in 2008
Net earnings of $118.3 million, compared to $218.2 million in the same period in 2008
Revised fourth quarter 2009 production guidance range to 86-89 Bcfe, up 12% from midpoints of previous guidance
For the third quarter of 2009, Southwestern reported net income of $118.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $218.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the same period in 2008. Net income for the third quarter of 2009 declined due to significantly lower natural gas prices, which were only partially offset by higher production volumes. Results for the third quarter of 2008 also included an after-tax gain on the sale of the company's utility assets of $35.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below) was $331.8 million in the third quarter of 2009, up from $312.1 million for the same period in 2008.
"We had a solid quarter despite depressed natural gas prices which were at a seven-year low and the various curtailment issues we experienced related to maintenance and repairs of the Boardwalk Pipeline," remarked Harold M. Korell, Executive Chairman of Southwestern Energy. "We do not expect these factors to weigh as heavily in the fourth quarter of 2009, as the Boardwalk Pipeline was placed on-line sooner than we had expected and as gas prices appear to be moving higher than they have been over the past nine months. As a result of the Boardwalk Pipeline being back on-line, we were able to reach another milestone last week when we surpassed 1 Bcfe of net production per day as a company. As we look ahead, we see continued profitable growth in our production and reserves which, coupled with our low cost structure, will create tremendous value for Southwestern Energy and its shareholders."
 
Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $172.0 million for the third quarter of 2009, down from $280.6 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a 41% decrease in realized natural gas prices and a 12% increase in operating costs and expenses, which were partially offset by a 38% increase in production volumes.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 73.2 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2009, up from 52.8 Bcfe in the third quarter of 2008, and included 58.8 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 37.2 Bcf in the third quarter of 2008. Beginning on October 8, 2009, the Fayetteville Lateral of the Texas Gas Transmission Pipeline (Boardwalk Pipeline) was placed back into service after being shut down since September 1, 2009 due to maintenance and pipeline inspection. The Greenville Lateral of the Boardwalk Pipeline was also placed back into service in October after this shut down.
As a result of the repairs, the company is now able to transport all of its current production from the Fayetteville Shale and, at October 24, 2009, was producing at a gross operated rate of approximately 1,230 MMcf per day. Southwestern has revised its previous gas and oil production guidance range for 2009 from 278 to 288 Bcfe to 297 to 300 Bcfe, up approximately 53% over 2008 levels (using midpoints), due to the company's significant production growth from the Fayetteville Shale play and as a result of the pipeline repairs being completed faster than the company had anticipated. Of this total for 2009, approximately 243 to 245 Bcf is expected to come from the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern's production guidance for the remainder of 2009 is shown below:
Including the effect of hedges, Southwestern's average realized gas price in the third quarter of 2009 was $5.06 per Mcf, down 41% from $8.56 per Mcf in the third quarter of 2008. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $2.21 per Mcf during the third quarter of 2009, compared to a decrease of $0.26 per Mcf during the same period in 2008. Southwestern has approximately 33 Bcf of its remaining 2009 projected natural gas production hedged through fixed price swaps and collars at a weighted average floor price of $8.41 per Mcf.
Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the third quarter of 2009 was approximately $0.54 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $1.42 per Mcf lower during the third quarter of 2008. As of October 27, 2009, the company had protected approximately 50 Bcf of its fourth quarter 2009 expected gas production from the potential of widening basis differentials through hedging activities and sales arrangements at an average basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.25 per Mcf, excluding transportation charges and fuel charges. As of that same date for the first quarter of 2010, the company had protected approximately 45 Bcf at an average basis differential to
 
NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.20 per Mcf, excluding transportation and fuel charges. The company typically sells its natural gas at a discount to NYMEX spot prices due to locational basis differentials, transportation charges and fuel charges. The company pays third-party transportation charges which typically range from $0.15 to $0.32 per MMBtu and fuel charges which range from 0.25 to 2.25%.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment were $0.76 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009, down from $0.96 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease primarily resulted from the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in the third quarter of 2009.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were $0.38 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $0.33 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily due to the increased payroll and other employee-related costs primarily associated with the expansion of the company's operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play, including a $5.4 million increase in incentive compensation that was accrued during the quarter, which were partially offset by the effects of the company's increased production volumes.
Taxes other than income taxes per unit of production were $0.10 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $0.15 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower commodity prices and changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of the company's production volumes.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $1.43 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $1.86 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2008. The decline in the average amortization rate was primarily the result of the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, impairments that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. The future full cost pool amortization rate cannot be predicted with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas gathering and marketing activities, was $25.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2009, up from $18.3 million in the same period in 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gathering revenues from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. At October 26, 2009, the company's midstream segment was gathering approximately 1,304 MMcf per day through 1,091 miles of gathering lines in the Fayetteville Shale play area, up from approximately 675 MMcf per day a year ago. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases.

First Nine Months of 2009 Financial Results
For the first nine months of 2009, Southwestern reported a net loss of $193.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, which included a first quarter $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment ($558.3 million net of taxes) of the company's natural gas and oil properties resulting from lower natural gas prices. Excluding the non-cash impairment, Southwestern's net income for the first nine months of 2009 was $364.8 million (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $463.7 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in the same period in 2008. Excluding the non-cash impairment, the company's financial results have been impacted primarily by lower realized natural gas prices during the first nine months of 2009, partially offset by significant growth in production volumes.
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), was $1.03 billion for the first nine months of 2009, up 16% from $884.1 million for the same period in 2008.
 
Excluding the non-cash ceiling test impairment, operating income from the company's E&P segment was $526.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), compared to $661.4 million for the same period in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized natural gas prices and increased operating costs and expenses which were partially offset by higher production.
-
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production was 211.4 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2009, compared to 137.0 Bcfe in the first nine months of 2008, and included 169.6 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 90.4 Bcf in the first nine months of 2008.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $5.31 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $8.19 per Mcf in the first nine months of 2008. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized during the first nine months of 2009 by $2.15 per Mcf, compared to a decrease of $0.64 per Mcf during the first nine months of 2008. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first nine months of 2009 was approximately $0.77 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX spot prices, compared to approximately $0.90 per Mcf lower than NYMEX spot prices during the first nine months of 2008.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.76 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2009, down from $0.90 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in the first nine months of 2009.
General and administrative expenses were $0.34 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $0.38 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the company's increased production volumes which more than offset the effects of increased payroll, incentive compensation and other employee-related costs
 
primarily associated with the expansion of the company's operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play. Southwestern added 227 new employees during the first nine months of 2009.
 
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.10 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2009, compared to $0.15 per Mcfe during the first nine months of 2008, primarily due to lower commodity prices and the change in the mix of the company's production volumes.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $1.56 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $2.03 per Mcfe in the first nine months of 2008, primarily due to the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and the sale of natural gas and oil properties in 2008, as the proceeds were credited to the full cost pool.
- Operating income for the company's midstream activities was $80.3 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $43.4 million in the first nine months of 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities related to the Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
Midstream Services
- In the first nine months of 2009, Southwestern invested approximately $1.4 billion, compared to approximately $1.3 billion during the first nine months of 2008, which included $1.2 billion invested in its E&P business and $167 million invested in its Midstream Services activities. Of the approximately $1.2 billion invested in its E&P business, $1.0 billion was invested in its Fayetteville Shale play, $123 million in East Texas, $35 million in its conventional Arkoma Basin program and $35 million in New Ventures. The company expects that its total capital investments for the full year of 2009 to be approximately $1.8 billion.
Capital Investments
E&P Operations Review
- For the first nine months of 2009, Southwestern placed a total of 324 operated wells on production in the Fayetteville Shale play, all of which were horizontal wells fracture stimulated using slickwater.
Fayetteville Shale Play
At October 24, 2009, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately 1,230 MMcf per day, up from approximately 600 MMcf per day a year ago. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area through October 24, 2009.
 
 
 
During the third quarter of 2009, the company's horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $2.9 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,100 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average completed well cost of $2.9 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,123 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 11 days from re-entry to re-entry in the second quarter of 2009. The company currently has 17 drilling rigs running in its Fayetteville Shale play area, 13 that are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 4 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical portion of the wells. The company currently expects its gross well count in the play during 2009 to be approximately 550 wells (80% operated).
Since 2007, improvements in the company's completion practices and longer lateral lengths have resulted in quarter-over-quarter improvements in average initial production rates of operated wells placed on production. During the third quarter of 2009, Southwestern placed three wells on production with initial production rates over 6.0 MMcf per day. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter and through October 23, 2009, the company placed two wells on production with initial production rates over 6.0 MMcf per day, including its highest rate well, the Linda Linn 08-12 1-23H located in Faulkner County, with an initial production rate of approximately 6.7 MMcf per day. Results from the company's drilling activities from 2007 through 2009, by quarter, are shown below.
 
 
Note: Results as of September 30, 2009.  
SW  Slickwater fluids
XL  Crosslinked gel fluids
Hy-RHy  Hybrid or Reverse Hybrid method (combination slickwater/crosslinked gel fluid system)
(1) The significant increase in the average initial production rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the subsequent decrease for the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflected the impact of the delay in the Boardwalk Pipeline.  Wells that were placed on production in January and February of 2009 had average initial production rates of 2,806 Mcf per day and 2,749 Mcf per day, respectively, while wells placed on production during March 2009 had average initial production rates of 3,353 Mcf per day.
In 2008, the company developed a 4-square mile area of its Fayetteville Shale acreage in a pilot program with horizontal wells spaced at approximately 1,000 feet apart, representing approximately 110-acre spacing. Beginning in late 2008, Southwestern began drilling wells to test tighter well spacing. Through September 30, 2009, the company had placed over 200 wells on production that have well spacing of 700 feet or less, representing approximately 65-acre spacing or less. Results to date have been encouraging. In the areas the company has currently drilled, it now expects to drill between 10 and 12 wells per section in the Fayetteville Shale, pending additional well data and analyses. Additionally, the company is currently testing eight different pilot areas with well spacings that will range from 300 to 600 feet apart.
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through September 30, 2009, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue curve" is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet, while the "purple curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 4,000 feet. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 Bcf typecurves are shown solely for reference purposes and are not intended to be projections of the performance of the company's wells.
 
At September 30, 2009, Southwestern held approximately 879,000 net acres in the play area (including 125,372 net acres in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin).
-In the second quarter of 2008, Southwestern signed a 50/50 joint venture agreement with a private company targeting the Haynesville/Bossier Shale intervals in Shelby and San Augustine Counties, Texas. The first horizontal well, the Red River 877 #1 located in Shelby County, reached total depth in the fourth quarter of 2008, was production tested at 7.2 MMcf per day in the first quarter of 2009. The second horizontal well, the Red River 164 #1 located in San Augustine County, was production tested at 13.4 MMcf per day in the second quarter of 2009. The company completed a third well, the Red River 619 #1 located in San Augustine County, which was production tested in the third quarter of 2009 at 16.7 MMcf per day. A fourth well, the Burrows Gas Unit #1-H, is currently being tested. A fifth well, the Red River 257 #1 is waiting on completion. The company is currently drilling a sixth well, the Red River 257 #2 located in San Augustine County. Southwestern plans to participate in at least one additional well during 2009. In total, Southwestern has approximately 32,800 net acres it believes is prospective for the Haynesville/Bossier Shale.
East Texas
Southwestern participated in drilling 33 wells in East Texas during the first nine months of 2009, 28 of which were James Lime horizontal wells. The company currently has 37 operated James Lime horizontal wells on production which had average gross initial production rates of 9.5 MMcf per day. Southwestern's current net production from the James Lime is approximately 48 MMcf per day. Production from the company's East Texas properties was 24.6 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 24.1 Bcfe for the first nine months of 2008.
 
(Outside the Fayetteville Shale play area) Southwestern participated in drilling 14 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the first nine months of 2009. Production from the company's conventional Arkoma Basin was 16.9 Bcf for the first nine months of 2009, compared to 18.6 Bcf for the first nine months of 2008.  
Conventional Arkoma Program
-
- At September 30, 2009, Southwestern held approximately 161,900 net undeveloped acres in the United States outside of its core operating areas in connection with New Ventures, including approximately 139,700 net acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective.
New Ventures
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of our peers and of prior periods.  
One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.
Additional non-GAAP financial measures we may present from time to time are net income attributable to Southwestern Energy, diluted earnings per share attributable to Southwestern Energy stockholders and our E&P segment operating income, all which exclude certain charges or amounts.  Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
See the reconciliations below of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
