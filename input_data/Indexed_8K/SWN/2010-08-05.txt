< p style="FONT-SIZE:12pt; MARGIN:0px; LINE-HEIGHT:14pt; FONT-FAMILY:Arial" align=justify>Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the second quarter of 2010 was approximately $0.40 per Mcf lower than average monthly NYMEX settlement prices, compared to approximately $0.60 per Mcf lower during the second quarter of 2009. As of June 30, 2010, the company had basis protected on approximately 60.0 Bcf of its third quarter 2010 expected gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately $0.10 per Mcf, excluding transportation and fuel charges related to gas sales. The company typically sells its natural gas at a discount to average monthly NYMEX settlement prices due to locational basis differentials, transportation charges and fuel charges. For the remainder of 2010, the company expects to pay average third-party transportation charges in the ran ge of $0.25 to $0.32 per Mcf and average fuel charges in the range of 0.25% to 1.00% of transported volumes.
 
NEWS RELEASE  
Houston, Texas  August 5, 2010...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2010. Highlights include:
Natural gas and crude oil production of 98.3 Bcfe, up 32% over the same period in 2009
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $345.7 million (a non-GAAP measure reconciled below), up 6% from the same period in 2009
Net income of $122.1 million, compared to $121.1 million in the same period in 2009
For the second quarter of 2010, Southwestern reported net income of $122.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $121.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the prior year period. N et cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below) was $345.7 million for the second quarter of 2010, up 6% from $325.3 million for the same period in 2009.
"We saw meaningful progress on many fronts during the second quarter," stated Steve Mueller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "Our production grew by 32% compared to last year and grew 9% sequentially, as our operations in the Fayetteville Shale are back on track after a slowdown in the first quarter. We also closed the transaction we previously announced for the sale of a portion of our Haynesville and Middle Bossier properties in East Texas for approximately $355 million. We are keeping our production guidance unchanged for the third and fourth quarters of 2010, as our improving results i n the Fayetteville are currently expected to fully offset the expected production associated with the sold properties. Our capital investment program also remains unchanged at approximately $2.1 billion."
For the first six months of 2010, Southwestern reported net income of $293.9 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $311.7 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2009.  Net income for the first six months of 2009 included a $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment ($558.3 million net of taxes) of the company's natural gas and oil properties resulting from lower natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the non-cash impairment, Southwestern's net income for the first six months of 2009 was $246.6 million (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below), or $0.71 per diluted share.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities
 
 
 
(a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below) was $763.5 million for the first six months of 2010, up 9% compared to $697.9 million for the same period in 2009.
Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results
- Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $162.5 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $174.4 million for the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized gas prices combined with increased operating costs and expenses, which were only partially offset by higher production volumes.
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production totaled 98.3 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2010, up 32% from 74.3 Bcfe in the second quarter of 2009, and included 83.6 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 60.6 Bcf in the second quarter of 2009.
Including the effect of hedges, Southwestern's average realized gas price in the second quarter of 2010 was $4.27 per Mcf, compared to $5.01 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2009. The company's commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $0.58 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2010, compared to an increase of $2.11 per Mcf during the same period in 2009. At August 2, 2010, Southwestern had approximately 87 Bcf of its remaining 2010 projected natural gas production, or approximately 41%, hedged through fixed price swaps and collars at a weighted average floor price of $6.26 per Mcf. The company also had approximately 92 Bcf of its 2011 forecasted gas production hedged at an average floor price of $5.61 per Mcf and approximately 80 Bcf of its 2012 forecasted gas production hedged at an average floor price of $5.50 per Mcf.
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for the company's E&P segment were $0.85 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $0.73 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased gathering costs and increased costs associated with higher water disposal volumes related to its Fayetteville Shale operations.
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were $0.31 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $0.34 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the company's increased production volumes which mo re than offset increased payroll, incentive compensation and other employee-
 
 
 
 
related costs primarily associated with the expansion of the company's operations due to the Fayetteville Shale play.
Taxes other than income taxes per uni t of production were $0.09 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $0.08 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009. Taxes other than income taxes vary due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of the company's volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate was $1.33 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010, down from $1.46 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2009. The decrease in the average amortization rate was primarily due to lower finding and development costs. The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, impairments that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization. The future full cost pool amortization rate cannot be predicted with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors.
- Operating income for the company's midstream services segment, which is comprised of natural gas gathering and marketing activities, was $43.8 million for the second quarter of 2010, up from $27.8 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. At August 2, 2010, the company's midstream segment was gathering approximately 1,620 MMcf per day through 1,367 miles of gathering lines in the Fayetteville Shale play area, up from approximately 1,060 MMcf per day through 960 miles of gathering lines a year ago. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow as reserves related to the company's Fayetteville Shale play are developed and production increases.
Midstream Services
First Six Months of 2010 Financial Results
 
Operating income from the company's E&P segment was $412.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, up 17% compared to $354.4 million for the same period in 2009, excluding the non-cash impairment (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below). Th e increase was primarily due to higher production volumes, partially offset by lower realized gas prices and increased operating costs and expenses.
-
E&P Segment
Gas and oil production was 188.3 Bcfe in the first six months of 2010, up 36% compared to 138.2 Bcfe in the first six months of 2009, and included 159.1 Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from 110.8 Bcfe in the first six months of 2009.
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $4.82 per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first six months of 2010 compared to $5.44 per Mcf in the first six months of 2009. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized during the first six months of 2010 by $0.57 per Mcf, compared to an increa se of $2.12 per Mcf during the first six months of 2009. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the company's gas production during the first six months of 2010 was approximately
 
 
 
$0.45 per Mcf lower than average monthly NYMEX settlement prices, compared to approximately $0.87 per Mcf lower than NYMEX gas prices during the first six months of 2009.
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $0.81 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2010, compared to $0.76 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased gathering costs and increased costs associated with higher water disposal volumes in the company's Fayetteville Shale operations.
General and administrative expenses were $0.30 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2010, compared to $0.32 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to the effects of the company's increased production volumes which more than offset increased compensation and employee-related costs primarily associated with the expansion of the company's E&P operations in the Fayetteville Shale play.
Taxes other than income taxes were $0.11 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2010, compared to $0.10 per Mcfe during the first six months of 2009.
The company's full cost pool amortization rate decreased to $1.37 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2010, compared to $1.63 per Mcfe in the first six months of 2009, primarily due to the $907.8 million non-cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and the result of lower finding and development costs.
- Operating income for the company's midstream activities was $81.4 million in the first six months of 2010, compared to $55.2 million in the first six months of 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues and an increase in the margin from gas marketing activities related to the Fayetteville Shale play, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
Midstream Services
- For the first six months of 2010, Southwestern invested a total of approximately $1.0 billion, compared to $959.4 million during the first six months of 2009, which included $852.7 million invested in its E&P business and $139.0 million invested in its Midstream Services activities. Of the $852.7 million invested in its E&P business, approximately $666.3 million was invested in its Fayetteville Shale play, $86.8 million in East Texas, $34.3 million in Appalachia, $52.7 million in New Ventures and $6.6 million in its conventional Arkoma Basin program.
Capital Investments
E&P Operations Review
 During the second quarter of 2010, Southwestern placed a total of 143 operated wells on production in the Fayetteville Shale play, all of which were horizontal wells fracture stimulated using slickwater. At July 30, 2010, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was 1,447 MMcf per day, up from approximately 990 MMcf per day a year ago. The company is currently utilizing 24 drilling rigs in its Fayetteville Shale play, including 16 that are capable of drilling horizontal wells and 8 smaller rigs that are used to drill the vertical portion of the wells. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area through July 30, 2010.
Fayetteville Shale Play
 
 
During the second quarter of 2010, the company's horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $3.1 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,532 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 13 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average completed well cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,348 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 12 days from re-entry to re-entry in the first quarter of 2010. In the second quarter, the company had 22 wells with drill times of over 20 days, most of which were first wells in sections that were in the deeper southern areas of the play. During the second quarter of 2010, the company also placed 3 wells on production which had average times to drill to total depth of 5 days or less from re-entry to re-entry. In July of 2010, the company's average time to drill to total depth improved to 10 days from re-entry to re-entry, and the company also set a new record by drilling a well with total footage of approximately 6,600 feet in 4.0 days. The company's horizontal rig count will drop to 15 rigs in mid-August as a result of the lower drilling days.
The company's wells placed on production during the second quarter of 2010 averaged initial production rates of 3,449 Mcf per day, up 8% from average initial production rates of 3,197 Mcf per day in the first quarter of 2010. Results for the second quarter of 2010 include 75 wells placed on production which were the first well in a new section. The company also placed 9 wells on production at initial production rates over 6.0 MMcf per day. Results from the company's drilling activities from 2007 by quarter are shown below.
Note: Results as of June 3 0, 2010.  
(1)
The significant increase in the average initial production rate for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the subsequent decrease for the first quarter of 2009 primarily reflected the impact of the delay in the Boardwalk Pipeline.  
(2)
In the first quarter of 2010, the company's results were impacted by the shift of all wells to "green completions" and the mix of wells, as a large percentage of wells were placed on production in the shallower northern a nd far eastern borders of the company's acreage.
The company continues to test tighter well spacing and, at June 30, had placed 434 wells on production that have well spacing of 700 feet or less, representing approximately 65-acre spacing or less. The company had previously concluded that 10 to 12 wells per section is the minimum number of wells needed to efficiently drain the reserves, however, recent information from this larger group of wells indicates interference of 5% to 8% compared to earlier estimates of 10% to 15% from a smaller well set. The company continues to focus on optimizing the well spacing for the play and plans to test over 44 different pilots with well spacing that will range from 200 to 450 feet apart as part of its 2010 drilling program. Within those pilots, approximately 67% of the wells have been spud and 23% of those wells have been placed on p roduction.
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through June 30, 2010, for the company's horizontal wells using slickwater and crosslinked gel fluids. The "dark blue curve" is for horizontal wells fracture stimulated with either slickwater or crosslinked gel fluid. The "red curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 3,000 feet, while the "purple curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 4,000 feet and the new "light blue curve" indicates results for the company's wells with lateral lengths greater than 5,000 feet. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's Fayetteville Shale wells' performance and should not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 Bcf typecurves are shown solely for reference purposes and are not intended to be projections of the performance of the company's wells.
At June 30, 2010, Southwestern held approximately 889,000 net acres in the play area (including approximately 125,000 net acres in the traditional Fairway portion of the Arkoma Basin).
 On June 30, 2010, Southwestern closed the previously announced sale of certain oil and gas leases, wells and gathering equipment held by the company in East Texas. Total net proceeds from the sale were $355.8 million. The sale included only theproducing rights to the Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale intervals in approximately 20,063 net acres. The company has retained the drilling and producing rights covering all other depths in the acreage, including the company's current James Lime and Pettet drilling programs.
East Texas
Southwestern still has approximately 10,500 net acres with Haynesville and Middle Bossier Shale potential. The company drilled two wells on this acreage (Hawthorne prospect) in the second quarter, the Timberstar Blackstone A-1H well targeting the Haynesville Shale formation and the Harris B-1H well targeting the Middle Bos sier Shale formation. The Blackstone well is currently being completed and the Harris well will be completed in the fourth quarter. A third well, the Crest C-1H, is currently drilling and will be completed in the fourth quarter.
Production from the company's East Texas properties was 19.2 Bcfe during the first six months of 2010, compared to 15.6 Bcfe during the same period last year. Approximately 2.1 Bcfe of company's 2010 production was related to its Haynesville and Middle Bossier properties which were sold in June. Southwestern participated in drilling 26 wells in East Texas during the first six months of 2010, 9 of which were James Lime horizontal wells, 13 of which were Haynesville horizontal wells and 4 of which were Pettet horizontal oil wells. Initial production rates from James Lime wells that were placed on production during the
 
 
 
 
second quarter averaged 7.2 MMcfe per day and initial production rates from Pettet oil wells that were placed on production during the quarter averaged 505 barrels of oil per day, with 0.7 MMcf per day of associated gas.
(Outside the Fayetteville Shale play area) Southwestern participated in drilling 3 wells in its conventional Arkoma Basin drilling program during the second quarter of 2010. Production from the company's conventional Arkoma Basin was 10.0 Bcf for the first six months of 2010, compared to 11.6 Bcf for the first six months of 2009.  
Conventional Arkoma Program
 At June 30, 2010, Southwestern held approximately 150,800 net undeveloped acres in Pennsylvania under which it believes the Marcellus Shale is prospective. In July, the company placed the Greenzweig #1-H well, its first horizontal well which was drilled in 2008, on production and it is currently producing approximately 3.3 MMcf per day without compression into the pipeline with just over 3,000 psi of flowing tubing pressure. The Greenzweig #1-H well was dri lled in late-2008 and had a 2,945-foot horizontal lateral and was fractured stimulated with slickwater in 7 stages. In 2010, the company has drilled 4 horizontal wells, all of which are currently being scheduled to be completed in September. Approximately 20 wells are expected to be drilled by Southwestern in 2010.

Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of our peers and of prior periods.  
One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii) changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.
Additional non-GAAP financial measures we may present from time to time are net income attrib utable to Southwestern Energy, diluted earnings per share attributable to Southwestern Energy stockholders and our E&P segment operating income, all which exclude certain charges or amounts.  Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the Company's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the Company excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
 
See the reconciliations below of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures
 
 
 
 
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
