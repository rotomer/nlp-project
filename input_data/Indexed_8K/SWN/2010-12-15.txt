The following table sets forth the annual base salaries of the Company's Named Executive Officers as of January 1, 2010 and 2011, the long-term incentives granted to the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2011 and the target annual incentive award and the maximum total annual cash incentive award (i.e., assuming attainment of the maximum performance objectives and the maximum discretionary amount) as a percentage of base salary for 2011 for each Named Executive Officer under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan.  The restricted stock and stock option awards were granted to the Named Executive Officers under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan on December 9, 2010.  Each of the restricted stock awards vests ratably over a period of four years.  The exercise price of the stock options is $36.22, the closing price of the Company's common stock on December 8, 2010, and each of the option awards vests ratably over a period of three years.  The performance units were granted under the Company's 2002 Performance Unit Plan, with each unit vesting in three years and having a target value of $1,000.
