The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also ask to see the Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

February 14, 2011
The Administrative Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement described below.
Gentlemen/Ladies:
I am counsel for Southwestern Energy Company (the ""), and have represented the Borrower and the Subsidiaries of the Borrower listed on (the "") in connection with its execution and delivery of a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 14, 2011 (the "") among the Borrower, the Lenders named therein, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and providing for Advances  and Letters of Credit in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $1,500,000,000 (or $2,000,000,000 if the option under thereof has been exercised and become effective) at any one time outstanding.  All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement.
Borrower
Schedule 1
Guarantors
Agreement
Section 2.6.3
I have examined the Borrower's and each Guarantor's **[describe constitutive documents of Borrower and Guarantors and appropriate evidence of authority to enter into the transaction]**, the Loan Documents and such other matters of fact and law which we deem necessary in order to render this opinion.  Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
l.
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
2.
The execution and delivery by the Borrower and each Guarantor of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance by the Borrower and each Guarantor of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate or limited liability company proceedings on the part of the Borrower and each Guarantor and will not:
(a)
require any consent of the Borrower's or any Guarantor's shareholders or members (other than any such consent as has already been given and remains in full force and effect);
(b)
violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of incorporation, articles or certificate of organization, bylaws, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder; or
(c)
result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
3.
The Loan Documents to which the Borrower or any Guarantor is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower or such Guarantor, as the case may be, in accordance with their terms except to the extent the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject also to the availability of equitable remedies if equitable remedies are sought.
4.
Except for the litigation disclosed in Borrower's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and updated in the Borrower's most recent Form 10-Q, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, threatened against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5.
No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the Obligations, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.
This opinion may be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their participants, assignees and other transferees.
Very truly yours,

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
SECTION 1.  .  Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in (or defined by reference in) the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement Definitions
SECTION 2.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants (which representations and warranties shall be deemed to have been renewed on each date on which a Lender makes a Loan to the Company) that:
Representations and Warranties
(a)
It is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
(b)
It has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder.  The execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been duly authorized by proper organizational proceedings, and this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.
(c)
Neither the execution and delivery by it of this Guaranty, nor the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on it or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) its articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, bylaws, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of such Subsidiary Guarantor or a Subsidiary thereof pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement.  No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by it or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by it or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Guaranty or the performance by it of its obligations hereunder or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Guaranty.
SECTION 3.  .  Subject to Section 9 hereof, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, as primary obligor and not as merely surety, the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or early termination or otherwise, and at all times thereafter) and performance of the unpaid principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans to the Company, all accrued and unpaid fees and all expenses, reimbursements, indemnities and other obligations of the Company to the Lender or any other indemnified party arising under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any such obligations incurred or accrued during the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable in such proceeding (collectively, subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof, the "Guaranteed Obligations").  Upon failure by the
The Guaranty
Company to pay punctually any such amount, each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall forthwith on written demand pay to the Agent the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in the Credit Agreement. This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.  Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any right to require the Agent or any Lender to sue the Company, any other guarantor, or any other person obligated for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything else in this Subsidiary Guaranty, this Subsidiary Guaranty shall in no event constitute a guarantee of the Loans to the Additional Borrower or any other obligations of any Additional Borrower arising under the Loan Documents.
SECTION 4.  .  Subject to Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:
Guaranty Unconditional
(i)
any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise, or any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii)
any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Credit Agreement or the Notes;
(iii)
 any release, nonperfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Company under the Credit Agreement or the Notes or any obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iv)
any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Company or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Company or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or the assets of any of the foregoing, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Company or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(v)
the existence of any claim, setoff or other right which such Subsidiary Guarantor may have at any time against the Company, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transaction;
(vi)
any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Company, or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason related to the Credit Agreement or the Notes, or any provision of applicable law or regulation
purporting to prohibit the payment by the Company, or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, of the principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement or the Notes; or
(vii)
any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Company, any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder.
SECTION 5.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitment shall have terminated or expired.  If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on the Notes or any other amount payable by the Company under the Credit Agreement, or by any Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise, each Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
Discharge Only Upon Payment In Full: Reinstatement In Certain Circumstances
SECTION 6.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Company, any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Person.
Waivers
SECTION 7.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim for subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or otherwise, against the Company arising out of or by reason of this Guaranty or the obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the payment or securing or purchasing of any of the Guaranteed Obligations by any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, unless and until the Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitment has terminated.
Subrogation
SECTION 8.  .  If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement or the Notes shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Agent.
Stay of Acceleration
SECTION 9.  .
Limitation on Obligations
(a) The provisions of this Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Subsidiary
Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by any Subsidiary Guarantor, the Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor's "Maximum Liability"). This Section 9(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability of the Subsidiary Guarantors is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and neither a Subsidiary Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right or claim under this Section 9(a) with respect to the Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law.
(b)
Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of such Subsidiary Guarantor, and may exceed the aggregate Maximum Liability of all other Subsidiary Guarantors, without impairing this Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Agent hereunder. Nothing in this Section 9(b) shall be construed to increase any Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
(c)
If any Subsidiary Guarantor (a "Paying Subsidiary Guarantor") shall make any payment or payments under this Guaranty, each other Subsidiary Guarantor (each a "Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor") shall contribute to such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's "Pro Rata Share" of such payment or payments made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor.  For the purposes hereof, each Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's "Pro Rata Share" with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Subsidiary Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio of (i) such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor from the Company after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (ii) the sum of the Maximum Liabilities (which may be greater than the amount of Guaranteed Obligations) of all Subsidiary Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Subsidiary Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for any Subsidiary Guarantor, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Subsidiary Guarantor from the Company after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means).  Nothing in this Section 9(c) shall affect any Subsidiary Guarantor's several liability for the entire amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Subsidiary Guarantor's Maximum Liability).  Each Subsidiary Guarantor covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Guaranty from a Non-Paying Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the Guaranteed Obligations.  The provisions of this Section 9(c) are for the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and the
Subsidiary Guarantors and may be enforced by any of them in accordance with the terms hereof.
SECTION 10.  .  All payments received by the Agent hereunder shall be applied by the Agent to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations in the following order unless a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise direct:
Application of Payments
(a)
FIRST, to payment of all costs and expenses of the Agent incurred in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(b)
SECOND, to payment of that portion of the Guaranteed Obligations constituting accrued and unpaid interest and fees; and
(c)
THIRD, to payment of any other Guaranteed Obligations.
SECTION 11.  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Subsidiary Guarantor will be unconditionally and absolutely released and discharged from its obligations under this Guaranty upon the effectiveness of any release request under Section 8.4 of the Credit Agreement.  
Release of Guarantor
SECTION 12.  .  All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be given or made by facsimile or other writing and faxed, mailed or delivered to the intended recipient at its address or facsimile number set forth under its name on Schedule I hereto or such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII of the Credit Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided in this Guaranty, all such communications shall be deemed to have been duly given when transmitted by facsimile, or personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice sent by certified mail return-receipt requested, on the date set forth on the receipt (provided that any refusal to accept any such notice shall be deemed to be notice thereof as of the time of any such refusal), in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.
Notices
SECTION 13.  .  No failure or delay by the Agent in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  The rights and remedies provided in this Guaranty, the Credit Agreement and the Notes shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.
No Waivers
SECTION 14.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Company's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Subsidiary Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Guaranty, and agrees that the Agent does not have any duty to advise such Subsidiary Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
No Duty to Advise
SECTION 15.  .  This Guaranty is for the benefit of the Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and permitted assigns and in the event of an assignment of any amounts payable under the Credit Agreement or the Notes of the Borrower, the rights hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, shall be transferred

SECTION 16.  .  Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only in writing signed by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Agent.

SECTION 17.  .  Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, all court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses, paid or incurred by the Agent in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, the Company, such Subsidiary Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Costs of Enforcement
SECTION 18.  .  THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  EACH SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR HEREBY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
