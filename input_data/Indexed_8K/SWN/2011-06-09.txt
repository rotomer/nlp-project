Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On June 6, 2011, Southwestern Energy Company's subsidiary, Southwestern Energy Production Company ("SEPCO") received by mail a letter dated June 2, 2011 from the judge in the matter of Tovah Energy, LLC and Toby Berry-Helfand v. David Michael Grimes, et, al., in which he made certain rulings with respect to the post-verdict motions and responses filed by the parties which do not constitute the entry of a judgment at this time. SEPCO believes that a judgment will not be entered until the ordered accounting, discussed in more detail below, has been completed and a calculation of disgorgement damages has been made.
 
. 
 In his rulings, the judge denied SEPCO's motion for judgment, judgment notwithstanding the verdict and to disregard certain findings.  Plaintiff's and intervenor's claim for a constructive trust was denied but the judge ruled that plaintiff and intervenor shall recover from SEPCO $11,445,000 and a reasonable attorney's fee of 40% of the total damages awarded and are entitled to recover on their claim for disgorgement.  The judge ruled that, to assist in calculating an appropriate sum to award in disgorgement damages, plaintiff and intervenor are entitled to an accounting of the amount of profit of each of 143 designated wells up to the time of trial and the amount of profit of each of 13 designated wells during a specified one year period.  For the calculation of disgorgement damages, the judge stated that profit means revenues less expenditures of SEPCO.   The rulings further contemplate the payment of court costs and pre- and post-judgment interest
