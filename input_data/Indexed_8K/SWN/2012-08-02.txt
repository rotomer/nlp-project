FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS
 
 
Houston, Texas 
August 2
, 20

...Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE: SWN) today announced its financial and operating results for the
second
quarter of 20
1
2
. Highlights include:
 
 
For the
second
quarter of 2012, Southwestern
reported
a  
net
loss
of $
488.1
million
, or $
1.40
per
diluted
share
.
 
The n
et
loss
 
for the three months ended
June 30
, 20
12
include
d
a $
935.9
million non-cash ceiling test impairment
($
57
8
.9
million net of taxes)
of
the company's
natural gas and oil properties resultin
g from lower natural gas prices. Excluding the non-cash impairment, Southwestern reported net income for the
second
quarter of 2012 of $
90
.
8
million
(
reconciled below
), or $
0.
2
6
per diluted share, compared to net income of
$
167.5
million
, or $
0.
48
per
diluted
share
, for the prior year period.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities
 
(
reconciled below
) was $
354.5
 
million
for
the
second
 
quarter of 20
1
2
,  
down
compared to
 $
448.2
 
million
for the same period in
20
1
1
primarily due to lower realized gas prices
.
 
"
The second quarter was challenging for any company drilling for natural gas. Southwestern Energy has embraced those challenges and our results show we had a very strong quarter," remarked Steve Mueller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy. "Our costs continue to be low, with all-in cash operating costs of $1.20 per Mcfe for the second quarter of 2012 and our Fayetteville and Marcellus drilling programs continue to provide a meaningful drilling inventory at the prices we see going forward. Finally, our New Ventures activities in the Brown Dense play are providing encouraging results and we are excited about the other ideas we are pursuing. We see many challenges as we look toward the second half of 2012, but those challenges also bring opportunities that have the potential to make 2012 one of the most exciting years in our history."

Financial Results
 
E&P Segment
 
 
Excluding
the non-cash impairment
, o
perating income from
the company's
E&P segment
(reconciled below)
was $
76.0
 
million for the three months ended
June 30
, 20
1
2
,  
compared to
 
$
222.5
 
million for the same period in 20
1
1
. The decrease was primarily due to
 
 
 
lower realized natural gas prices and increased operating costs and expenses
from higher activity levels
, partially offset by higher production
.
 
Southwestern
account
s
for
its
natural gas and oil properties using the full-cost method of accounting, which requires the
c
ompany to perform a ceiling test that limits the amount of
its capitalized gas and oil properties less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes
to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves
, net of taxes,
discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties
.
 
The company's non-cash ceiling test impairment used
the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub
 
natural gas of $3.15 per MMBtu and $92.17 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market
 
differentials,
compared to
$4.
12
per MMBtu and $
92.71
per barrel for West Texas Intermediate oil, adjusted for market differentials
, at December 31, 2011.
 
Gas and oil production totaled
137.4
Bcfe in the
second
quarter of
20
1
2
,  
up
12
%  
from
 
122.8
 
Bcfe in the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
, and included
121.0
Bcf
from
the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from
107.4
Bcf in the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
.  
Production from the Marcellus Shale was
9.9
Bcf in the
second
quarter
of 201
2
, compared to
5.1
Bcf in the
second
quarter of 201
1
.
 
Including the effect of hedges, Southwestern's average realized gas price in the
second
quarter of 20
1
2
was $
3.12
per Mcf, down
27
%  
from $
4.
30
per Mcf in the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
. T
he company's
commodity hedging activities increased its average gas price by $
1.3
6
per Mcf during the
second
quarter of 20
1
2
, compared to a
n
 
in
crease of $
0.
4
6
per Mcf during the same period in 20
1
1
.  
As of
June
 
30
, 201
2
, Southwestern had
NYMEX price hedges in place on notional volumes of
approximately
134
Bcf of its
remaining
2012 forecasted gas production hedged at an average floor price of $5.16 per Mcf and approximately 185 Bcf of its 2013 forecasted gas production hedged at an avera
ge floor price of $5.06 per Mcf
.
As of June 30, 2012, the company had protected approximately 131 Bcf of its remaining 2012 expected gas production from the potential of widening basis differentials through hedging activities and sales arrangements at an average basis differential to NYMEX gas prices of approximately ($0.03) per Mcf.
 
The company typically sells its natural gas at a discount to NYMEX settlement prices. This discount includes a basis differential, third-party transportation charges and fuel charges. Disregarding the impact of commodity price hedges, the company's average price received for its gas production during the
second
quarter of 201
2
was approximately
$0.
46
per Mcf lower than average NYMEX settlement prices, compared to approximately $0.4
7
per Mcf lower during the
second
quarter of 201
1
.  
 
In 201
2
, the company expects its total gas sales discount to NYMEX to be $0.45 to $0.
55
per Mcf.
 
Lease operating expenses per unit of production for
the company's
E&P segment were
$0.
79
per
Mcfe
in
 
the
second
quarter of 20
1
2
, compared to $0.
80
per Mcfe in the
second
quarter of 201
1
.  
The
de
crease was primarily due to
decreased compression
 
costs
, offset slightly by an increase in salt water disposal costs
.
 
General and administrative expenses per unit of production were
$0.
27
per
Mcfe in the
second
quarter of 201
2
,  
flat
compared to the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
.  
 
 
 
Taxes
other than income taxes per unit of production were
$0.
08
per Mcfe in the
second
 
quarter of 20
1
2
, compared to $
0.1
1
per Mcfe in the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
. Taxes other than income taxes vary due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of the company's volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices.
 
The company's full cost pool amortization rate
was
 $
1.
3
8
per Mcfe in the
second
 
quarter of 20
1
2
, compared to $
1.
28
per Mcfe
in the
second
quarter of 20
1
1
.
 
The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from full cost ceiling tests, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization.
 
The
company
cannot predict
its
future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors.
 
Midstream Services
 
Operating income for the company's
M
idstream
S
ervices
segment, which is comprised of natural gas gathering and marketing activities, was
$
71.8
million
for the three months ended
June 30
, 201
2
, up
20%
from $
59.6
million in the same period in 20
1
1
.  
The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues related to the
company's
Fayetteville
and Marcellus
Shale
properties
, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. At
June 30
, 20
12
, the company's midstream segment was gathering
approximately 2.
1
Bcf per day through
1,
829
miles of gathering lines
in the Fayetteville Shale play, compared to gathering approximately
2.0
Bcf per day a year ago
. Gathering volumes, revenues and expenses for this segment
are expected to grow over the next few years largely as a result of increased development of
the company's
acreage in the Fayetteville Shale and Marcellus Shale and the increased development activity undertaken by other operators in those areas.
 
First Six Months of 20
12
Financial Results
 
For the first six months of 2012, Southwestern
reported
a  
net
loss
of $
380.4
million
, or $
1.09
per
diluted
share
.
 
Excluding the non-cash
ceiling test
impairment,
the company
reported
adjusted net income f
or the first six months of 20
12
 
of
 $
19
8
.
5
million
(reconciled below)
, or $
0.
5
7
per diluted share, compared to
$304.1
million, or $0.
87
per diluted share,
for the first six months of 2011.
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (
reconciled
below) was $
725.3
million for the first six months of 20
12
,  
compared to
 $
839.7
million for the same period in 20
11
.  
 
 
E&P Segment
 
 
Excluding
the non-cash impairment
, o
perating income from
the company's
E&P segment
(reconciled below)
was $
19
2.3
million for the six months ended June 30, 20
12,
compared to
$400.8 million
for the same period in 20
11.
The
de
crease was primarily due to
lower average realized gas prices and
increased operating costs and expenses
 
from higher activity levels
which were partially offset by higher
 
production volumes
.
 
Gas and oil production was
270.8
 
Bcfe in the first six months of 20
12
,  
up
14
%  
compared to
237.8
Bcfe in the first six months of 20
11
, and included
236.8
 
Bcf from the company's Fayetteville Shale play, up from
208.5
Bcf in the first six months of 20
11
.  
Production from the Marcellus Shale was
19.2
Bcf in the
first six months
of 201
2
, compared to
7.9
Bcf in the
first six months of
201
1
.
The company expects that its full-year production for 2012 should range
 
 
between approximately 560 and 570 Bcfe, an increase of approximately 13% compared to 2011.
 
Southwestern's average realized gas price was $
3.30
 
per Mcf, including the effect of hedges, in the first six months of 20
1
2
compared to $
4.21
per Mcf in the first six months of 20
1
1
. The company's hedging activities increased the average gas price realized during the first six months of 20
1
2
by $
1.30
 
per Mcf, compared to a
n increase
of $
0.
45
per Mcf during the first six months of 20
1
1
. Disregarding the impact of hedges, the average price received for the
company's gas production during
 
the first six months of 20
1
2
was approximately $
0.
48
 
per Mcf lower than average
monthly
NYMEX
settlement
prices
, compared to
approximately $
0.45
per Mcf
during the first six months of 2011
.  
 
Lease operating expenses for the company's E&P segment were $
0.
81
 
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
2
,  
compared to
$0.
83
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
1
.  
The decrease was primarily due to decreased compression costs
in the Fayetteville Shale
.
 
General and administrative expenses were $
0.
29
 
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
2
, compared to $0.
27
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
1
.  
The increase in general and administrative expenses was
primarily a result of
personnel
and information system costs associated with the expansion of
the company's
E&P operations due to the continued development of the Fayetteville Shale play and Marcellus Shale play
.
 
Taxes
other than income taxes were $
0.
11
 
per Mcfe during the first six months of 20
1
2
,  
flat
compared to the first six months of 20
1
1
.  
In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed the Unconventional Gas Well Impact Fee Act
which
imposes an annual impact fee for a period of up to fifteen years on each natural gas well drilled. The impact fee adjusts annually based on the age of the well, the average NYMEX natural gas price for th
e year and an inflation index.
As a result of
this
legislation, Southwestern recorded a one
-
time expense in the first quarter of 2012 of $3.2 million
, or approximately $0.024 per Mcfe,
based on the required retroactive application of this legislation to all wells drilled in 2011 and previous years
.
 
The company's full cost pool amortization rate
in
creased to $
1.
36
 
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
2
, compared to $1.
3
0
per Mcfe in the first six months of 20
1
1
.
 
 
Midstream Services
-
Operating income for the company's midstream activities was $
141.1
 
million in the first six months of 20
1
2
,  
up
24
%  
compared to $
113.6
 
million in the first six months of 20
11
. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased gathering revenues related to the
company's
Fayetteville
and Marcellus
Shale
properties
, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses.
 
Capital
Structure and
Investments
At
June 30
, 201
2
, the company had approximately
$1.
7
billion in long-term debt and its
total
debt-to-total capitalization was
32.2
%,
 
compared to
 
25.3
% at December 31, 201
1
.  
Excluding the non-cash impairment,
the company's
total
debt-to-total capitalization was
29.0
%.
 
The company also had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $41 million and restricted cash of approximately $144 million at June 30, 2012.
For the first six months of 20
1
2
, Southwestern invested a total of
approximately
$
1.
2
 b
illion, compared to $
1.
1
billion
during the first six months of 20
1
1
, which included
$
1,065
 
million invested in its E&P business and
$
74
 
million invested in its Midstream Services activities.
 
 
Southwestern's total capital investments program for 201
2
is expected to be approximately $2.

E&P Operations
Review
 
Southwestern
invested
approximately
 
$
1,065
 
million in its E&P business during the first
six months
of 2012,
of which approximately
$
635
 
million was invested in its Fayetteville Shale play,
$
272
 
million in the Marcellus Shale,
$
145
 
million in New Ventures,
$
7
 
million in
Ark-La-Tex
and $6 million in E&P Services
.
 
 
Fayetteville Shale Play
 
 
For the
second quarter
of 201
2
, Southwestern placed a total of
1
31
 
operated wells on production in the Fayetteville Shale play, all of which were horizontal wells fracture stimulated using slickwater. At
June 30
, 201
2
, the company's gross production rate from the Fayetteville Shale play was approximately
1,877
MMcf per day, up from approximately
1,
775
MMcf
per day a year ago.
The company's production from the Fayetteville Shale has been affected by the recent extremely high temperatures in central Arkansas and, year-to-date, the company estimates that its production from the field has been reduced by approximately 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf due to the extreme heat. Since June 30, the company's gross producing rate has returned to approximately 2 Bcf per day.
The company is currently utilizing
11
 
drilling rigs in its Fayetteville Shale play, including
7  
that are capable of drilling horizontal wells
. The graph below provides gross production data from the company's operated wells in the Fayetteville Shale play area through
June 30
, 2012.
 
 
 
During the
second
quarter of 20
12
, the company's horizontal wells had an average completed well cost
of $2.
8
million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,
840
feet and average time to drill to total depth of
6.9
 
days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average
completed well cost of $
2.
8
million per well, average horizontal lateral length of
4,7
43
 
feet and average time to drill to total depth of
7.3
days from re-entry to re-entry in the
first
 
quarter of
 
 
20
1
2
.  
In the
second
quarter of 2012, the company
had
30
 
operated wells placed on production which had average times to drill to total depth of 5 days or less from re-entry to re-entry. In total, the company has had a total of
160
 
wells
drilled to total depth of 5 days or less from re-entry to re-entry.
 
The company's
wells placed on production during
the
second
quarter of
20
12
averaged initial production
rates of 3,
500
 
Mcf per
day
. R
esults from the company's drilling activities from 2007 by quarter are shown below.
 
 
Note: Results as of

Marcellus Shale
 
 
As of June 30, 2012
,  
Southwestern
 
has
participated in
a total of
120
 
operated horizontal wells in northeast Pennsylvania, of which
4
1
 
were producing
.  
Net production from the area was
9.9
Bcf in the
second
quarter of 2012, compared to
5.1
Bcf in the
second
quarter of 2011.
At
June 30
,
2012, the company's g
ross operated production from the area
was
 
approximately
166
 
MMcf per
day
and was limited by high line pressures
and
gathering
constraints
.
 
Recent
gross produc
tion
from the area has
exceeded 200
MMcf per day.
 
The graph below provides normalized average daily production data through
June 30
, 20
12
, for the company's horizontal wells
in the Marcellus Shale
. The "
purple
curve" indicates results for
20
wells
with
more than 12 fracture stimulation stages
,  
the "orange curve"
indicates results for
20
wells
with
9 to 12 fracture stimulation stages and the "green curve"
indicates results for
1 well
with
less than 9 fracture stimulation stages
. The normalized production curves are intended to provide a qualitative indication of the company's
Marcellus
Shale wells' performance and should
 
 
not be used to estimate an individual well's estimated ultimate recovery. The

Ark-La-Tex
 
 
Total n
et production from
the company's
East Texas
and conventional Arkoma Basin properties
was
6.4
Bcfe in
the
second
quarter of
201
2
, compared
to
10.3
Bcfe in
the
second
quarter of
20

On May
 
1,
201
2
,  
Southwestern
 
sold its
oil and
natural
gas leases, wells and
gathering
equipment in
its Overton Field in
East Texas for approximately $
1
68
million
, excluding typical
purchase price adjustments
.  
The sale
includes
approximately
19,800 net acres in Smith County, Texas. N
et production from the
field
was approximately
2
4
MMcf
e
per day
as of the closing date
and proved net reserves were approximately
143
Bcfe as of year-end 2011.
 
New Ventures
 
 
As of
June 30
, 201
2
,  
Southwestern
held
3,
756
,
870
net undeveloped acres in connection with
its
New Ventures prospects, of which 2,518,518 net acres were located in New Brunswick, Canada.
 
Southwestern has approximately 5
63
,000
net acres
targeting
the
Lower Smackover Brown Dense formation
in
southern
Arkansas and
northern
Louisiana
.  
The company has drilled
four
wells in the play area to date
and is currently drilling two wells
. The company's first two wells, which were completed earlier this year, are currently shut-in for testing.
The company's third well, the
BML #31-22 #1-1H located in Union Parish, Louisiana
,  
was drilled to a vertical depth of approximately
10,400
feet with a
4,300
-foot horizontal lateral and was completed with
19 successful
fracture stimulation stages
in June
.  
After
41
days of flowing up casing, this well's highest 24-hour producing rate to date was
421
 
barrels of
50
o
API oil per day,
3,900
Mcf
of high Btu gas
per day and
836
barrels of water per day (
43
% of load recovered to date)
with a
 
 
calculated
flowing
bottom
 
hole pressur
e
of
5,700
psi
on a
24/
64-inch choke
.  
The
well was shut-in on July
27
in order to
perform a pressure build-up test
. The company believes that it will begin selling
both
oil and gas from the BML well in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The oil pricing
the company is
receiving from this area is at a premium
to
 
WTI
due to the geographic location of the play
, and analysis of the gas shows
a
Btu content of
approximately
1,220
per cubic foot
, so
it
 
is expected to
receive a premium to
NYMEX gas prices
due to the richer gas liquids.
The company's fourth well, the Johnson #21
-22-1 #
1
located in Union Parish, Louisiana
, was drilled to a vertical depth of
10,507
feet in July.
Like in the BML well, t
his well also encountered unusually
high
pressure within the target formation.
The company plans
to
complete this well vertically
in August, but the well will be able to be
re-enter
ed as a horizontal well in the future.
 
The company has also commenced drilling on the
Dean
31-22-1E #1
, located in
Union
Parish, Louisiana, which is currently drilling at approximately

feet and
be completed vertically.
The company is also drilling the Doles
30-22-1H #1
, located in Union Parish, Louisiana, which is currently drilling at approximately
6,375
feet. This well is planned to be drilled to
a measured depth of
approximately
17,300
feet and is currently designed to be completed with a
6,000
-foot horizontal lateral.
 
The company has also leased approximately 2
90
,000
net acres in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in eastern Colorado where
the company
 
has begun
testing a new unconventional oil play targeting
m
iddle and
l
ate Pennsylvanian to Permian age
carbonates and shales. In
July
,  
the company
 
completed
its
first well
, the Ewertz Farms 1-58 #1-26, located in Adams County, Colorado,
which was drilled to a
total vertical depth of
8,550
feet with a
2,000
-foot
horizontal
lateral targeting the Marmaton formation. This well
began flowback
i
n  
mid-
July
and
 
only
24
%
of flowback has been recovered to date
, however oil production began 3 days after flowback commenced.
The highest 24-hour producing rate to date for the Ewertz Farms well was 65 barrels of oil per day, 40 Mcf of gas per day and 740 barrels of water per day on pump.
The company has also drilled
the Staner 5-58 #1-8 well located in Arapahoe County
to a total vertical depth of
9,650
 f
eet

.
The company will evaluate the production from these two wells over the next 90 days.
 
In New Brunswick, Canada, the company has deferred its
planned 2012 exploration program until 2013 to provide additional time for public engagement and completion of the permitting process
in the Province
.  
The
New Brunswick Department of Natural Resources and other key government officials support this decision and
the company will
continue to work together with the appropriate parties to deliver on
its
commitments to the Province
in 2013
.  
 
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The company
report
s
 
its
financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). However, management believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide users of this financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and the results of
its
peers and of prior periods. 
 
One such non-GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management presents this measure because (i) it is accepted as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt, (ii)
 
 
changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and (iii) changes in operating assets and liabilities may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred.
 
Additional non-GAAP financial measures
the company
may present from time to time are net income, diluted earnings per share and
its
E&P segment operating income, all which exclude certain charges or amounts. Management presents these measures because (i) they are consistent with the manner in which the
c
ompany's performance is measured relative to the performance of its peers, (ii) these measures are more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts, and (iii) charges or amounts excluded cannot be reasonably estimated and guidance provided by the
c
ompany excludes information regarding these types of items. These adjusted amounts are not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.
 
See the reconciliations below of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the three
and six
months ended
June 30
, 20
1
2
and
June 30
, 20
11
. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolat
ion or as a substitute for the c
ompany's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP
.
