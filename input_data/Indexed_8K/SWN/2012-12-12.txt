(e)  On December 6, 2012, after consideration and a review of a number of factors, including but not limited to performance, competitive market data and the recommendations of the Company's outside compensation consultants, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Southwestern Energy Company (the "Company") approved the annual base salaries, cash incentive compensation award levels and long-term incentive compensation awards for fiscal year 2013 of the Company's 2012 Named Executive Officers who are current employees of the Company.  
The following table sets forth the annual base salaries of the Company's current Named Executive Officers as of January 1, 2012 and 2013, the long-term incentives granted to the current Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2013 and the target annual cash incentive award and the maximum total annual cash incentive award (i.e., assuming attainment of the maximum performance objectives and the maximum discretionary amount) as a percentage of base salary for 2013 for each current Named Executive Officer under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan.  The restricted stock and stock option awards were granted to the Named Executive Officers under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan on December 6, 2012.  Each of the restricted stock awards vests ratably over a period of four years.  The exercise price of the stock options is $34.50, the closing price of the Company's common stock on December 5, 2012, and each of the option awards vests ratably over a period of three years.  The performance units were granted under the Company's 2002 Performance Unit Plan, with each unit vesting in three years and having a target value of $1,000.
