...Southwestern Energy Compa
ny (NYSE: SWN) today announced its
 
total
capital investment program
in
20
1
3
is planned to be approximately $
2.
0
billion,
compared to
approximately $2.
1
billion in 201
2, consisting of
approximately $
1.8
billion for its exploration and production segment, $
160
million for its
m
idstream segment
and
 
$
40
 
million for corporate purposes.
 
Southwestern is targeting total
net
gas and oil production of 62
8
to
6
40
Bcfe
in 2013
, up approximately 1
1
to 1
3
%
over the company's expected 2012 level.
Gross operated production
is expected to grow
approximately
4
%
in the Fayetteville Shale
in 2013
,  
however
the company's net revenue interest is expected to change from
approximately
64
% in 2012 to
61
%
in 2013
.  
As a result, total net production from the Fayetteville Shale in 2013 is expected to be 475 to 480 Bcf
,
compared to 484 to 486 Bcf in 2012. The change in net revenue interest in 2013 reflects the move to increased drilling on the eastern side of the field however, longer term, the company's average net rev
enue interest is expected to be approximat
ely 64
%.
In the Marcellus Shale,
the company expects its average net revenue interest to remain the same in 2013, resulting in both gross and net production more than doubling from 63 to 65 gross Bcf (53 to 55 net Bcf) in 2012 to 160 to 165 gross Bcf (
134 to 139 net Bcf) in 2013
.
 
"
2013 will be an exciting year for
 
Southwestern Energy
," stated Steve Mueller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Energy
.  
"
In the Fayetteville Shale,
we will continue to drive our costs and drilling time down as our newly acquired frac fleets become operational
and
our target is to
 
invest within cash flow
. In the
Marcellus
Shale,
the infrastructure build over the past two years will
enable
a significant ramp in production from all of our acreage
holdings
in this highly economic project
.  
In our New Ventures,
we will continue to
pursue
the
commerciality of
our
Brown Dense
project, plus
you will see us drill
additional wells
in our Colorado and Montana projects and
in
at least one more new
project
in 2013. Finally,
our focus remains on delivering strong r
eturns through both building on our
 operational strengths and developing a portfolio of projects that provide an ongoing platform for growth
.

.
 
 
 
Southwestern expects to participate in approximately
48
0 to 490
 
total gross wells (
100% will be
 
operated)
in 201

, compared to an estimated
55
3
 
total gross wells in 20
1
2
(approximately
538
 
operated). The company's 201

net well count
is expected to
 
be approximately
315-325
 
wells compared to approximately
36
7
 
net wells in
20
1
2
.  
 
In
 
the Fayetteville Shale
,  
Southwestern
 
plans to
drill
approximately
385 to 390
gross wells
in 2013
,  
all
of which will be operated.
Southwestern
expects that the
average time to drill
its operated horizontal wells
to total depth from re-entry to re-entry
will
continue to
decrease in 201
3
to approximately
6.5
days from approximately
6.8
days projected for 201
2. The company's average
2013
completed well cost is estimated to be $2.7 million per well with a 5,100 average horizontal lateral, compared to an estimated $2.8 million well
cost with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,600 feet in 2012.
 
 
In the Marcellus Shale
,  
Southwestern
plans to
manage its production increase to available capacity
and
drill
a total of
86 to 88
 
gross
wells,
all
 
of which will be operated
.  
Of these, approximately
3
5
 
wells will be located in Bradford County,
40

days
, compared to
approximately
13.1
days projected for 201
2. Southwestern's average 2013 completed well cost is estimated to be $7.1 million per well with a 4,700 average horizontal lateral with 15

completed stages, compared to an estimated $6.3 million well cost with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,100 feet and 1
2.7
completed stages in 2012.
 
 
 
In the company's

its
201

projected natural gas production
 
hedged through fixed price swaps and collars at a weighted average floor price of $
5.06
per Mcf
.  
 
Assuming a NYMEX commodity price of $
3.50
per Mcf of gas for 20

, the company is targeting net income of
$525 to $535
million and net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure; see "Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) of
$1,750 to $1,760
million in 20
1

. The company expects net income plus interest, income tax
 
 
expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (also known as EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure; see "Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below) to be approximately
$1,780 to $1,790
 
million in 20

. The company has also provided additional price scenarios and their corresponding estimated financial results for 20

Current Update on
Operations
 
In
the Fayetteville Shale, Southwestern expects to place approximately 100 wells
on production
during the fourth quarter of 2012. Current estimates of completed well costs
for wells placed on production during
the fourth quarter
of 2012
are approximately $2.5 million per well
with average lateral lengths of approximately 4,300 feet. A
verage initial production
rates
for these wells
are currently
estimated at
approximately 3.
8
 
to 4.0
M
Mcf per
day
.  
 
In the Marcellus Shale,
the Bluestone Pipeline
was placed into service
into
the
TGP 300
Pipeline on
November
28
.  
Since that point, approximately
9
of the company's operated wells have been placed on production from its Range Trust area in Susquehanna County. The company expects that an additional
5
wells will be placed on production from Susquehanna County by the end of the year. On November 20, the company placed 4 wells on production in Lycoming County and expects to place
2
more wells on production by year-end. On December
17
,  
201
2
,  
the company's gross operated production rate from the Marcellus Shale
reached
approximately
290 MMcf
per day.
 
In the company's
Lower Smackover Brown Dense project
, Southwestern
tied
two
wells into a
new
gas pipeline
o
n
 
November 29.
Daily
production of both
oil and gas from t
he company's
third and
sixth well
s, the
BML #31-22 #1-1H
and the
 
Doles 30-22-1H #1
, respectively
, continues to increase as
flowback
fluids are
recovered
.  
The company's fifth well, the
vertical
Dean
31-22-1E #1
, is
also
currently producing
oil at relatively stable rates after
70
days.
 
Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities
(net cash flow)
is presented because of its acceptance as an indicator of an oil and gas exploration and production company's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur a
dditional debt. The company has
also included this information because changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which the company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
. The table below reconciles
 
201
3
forecasted
net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities with
201
3
forecasted
net cash provided by operating activities.
 
 
 
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest
expense
, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Southwestern has included information concerning EBITDA because it is used by certain investors as a measure of the ability of a company to service or incur indebtedness and because it is a financial measure commonly used in the energy industry. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of the company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA as defined above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net income is a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The table below reconciles 20

forecasted EBITDA with 20
