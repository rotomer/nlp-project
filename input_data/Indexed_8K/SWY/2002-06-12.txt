EXHIBIT 99 [Safeway Inc. Logo] Safeway, Inc. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contacts: Julie Hong (925) 467-3832 Melissa Plaisance (925) 467-3136 SAFEWAY INC. PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR SECOND QUARTER 2002 Pleasanton, CA -- June 12, 2002 -- Safeway Inc. expects to report diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.71-$0.73 for the second quarter ending June 15, 2002, before one-time charges. This is 5 - 8% below the existing First Call consensus estimate of $0.77 per share for the second quarter of 2002. In addition, the Company is revising its full year 2002 guidance to $2.86 - $2.90 per share before one-time charges, which is 8 - 9% below the current First Call consensus estimate of $3.15 for 2002. The sales and income shortfall is a result of the continued softness in the economy, an increase in competitive activity, an overly aggressive shrink effort and disruptions associated with the centralization of buying and merchandising. "While we are disappointed with our results, we firmly believe we can reverse current trends," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "We have just completed a mid-year business review and are very encouraged by the plans that will be implemented in the remainder of this year. The Company plans to invest 75 - 100% of its gross margin improvements to drive sales, slow down its shrink reduction efforts to allow more time for training store employees, and make adjustments in its marketing centralization initiative to ensure a smooth transition." Safeway also plans to reduce its capital spending plans for 2002 by approximately 10% to $1.9 billion from $2.1 billion. Based on the Company's new profit and capital forecast, it expects to generate more than $500 million in free cash flow this year, which it plans to use to buy back stock or pay down debt, depending on market conditions and strategic alternatives. The Company also expects to record one-time charges in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the second quarter of 2002, for severance costs related to the restructuring of a 29-store labor contract, for severance and transition costs related to the centralization of marketing functions, and for costs associated with 11 - 14 store closures.
