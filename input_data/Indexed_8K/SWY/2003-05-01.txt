Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. The following exhibit is furnished with this Form 8-K: 99. Press Release dated May 1, 2003. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information provided under Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition). Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216 dated March 27, 2003, the following information is being furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K. The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. On May 1, 2003, Safeway issued its first quarter 2003 earnings press release. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. In the press release, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA from continuing operations and free cash flow. Management of the Company believes that EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it assists investors in evaluating the Company's ability to service its debt. It also facilitates comparisons of the Company's results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. A reconciliation of EBITDA from continuing operations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the press release. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful indicator of the Company's ability to repay debt, fund share repurchases, and fund incremental capital expenditures that management believes will enhance stockholder value. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis and, as a result, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. - ------- 99. Press Release dated May 1, 2003, of Safeway Inc.

Safeway Inc. Announces First-Quarter 2003 Earnings PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 1, 2003--Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY) Results From Continuing Operations Safeway Inc. today reported income from continuing operations of $196.2 million ($0.44 per share) for the first quarter ended March 22, 2003. These results include the effect of adopting EITF 02-16, on accounting for vendor allowances, which reduced first-quarter 2003 earnings by approximately $10 million pre-tax ($0.014 per share). Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2002 was $325.0 million ($0.66 per share). Sales First-quarter 2003 comparable store sales were flat while identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) fell 0.5%. Excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales fell 1.8% and identical store sales fell 2.3%. Sales were impacted by continued softness in the economy. Total sales increased to $7.5 billion from $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to new store openings. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 163 basis points to 29.78% of sales in the first quarter of 2003 from gross profit of 31.41% in the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher fuel sales, transitional issues related to centralizing the company's marketing and procurement functions and higher shrink. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense increased 95 basis points to 24.40% of sales in the first quarter of 2003 compared to operating and administrative expense of 23.45% of sales in the first quarter of 2002 primarily due to increases in health and pension expense, as well as soft sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $90.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 compared to $80.1 million in the first quarter of 2002 as lower interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings resulting from the repurchase of Safeway stock in 2002. The interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) was 6.7 times for the quarter. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 8.08% for the quarter. Results from Discontinued Operations As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2002 management decided to sell Dominick's and exit the Chicago market. Accordingly, Dominick's results are presented as a discontinued operation. Loss from discontinued operations was $33.6 million ($0.08 per share) in the first quarter of 2003, consisting of $4.4 million loss from operations, $302.7 million adjustment to the estimated loss on disposal and $273.5 million income tax benefit. The adjustment of Dominick's net assets to a lower estimated fair value gives rise to a current tax benefit of $508.0 million. This benefit has been reduced to $273.5 million by a reserve of $234.5 million. The final determination as to fair value of Dominick's and amount of tax benefit is dependent on a number of factors, including completion of the transaction, terms of sale, review by taxing authorities and changes in tax law. Income from discontinued operations was $7.1 million ($0.01 per share) in the first quarter of 2002. Loss from discontinued store operations includes all direct charges to operations at Dominick's as well as allocated interest expense. Net Results Net income for the first quarter of 2003, including discontinued operations, was $162.6 million ($0.36 per share). Net loss for the first quarter of 2002, including discontinued operations and a $700.0 million ($1.41 per share) charge for the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 142, was $367.9 million ($0.74 per share). Capital Expenditures During the first quarter of 2003, Safeway invested approximately $140 million in cash capital expenditures. The company opened 9 new stores and closed 10 stores. For the year, the company expects to spend between $1.1 and 1.3 billion in cash capital expenditures while opening 50 to 55 new stores and completing between 100 and 125 remodels. Earnings Guidance Safeway expects its second-quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.49 per share and between $2.20 and $2.25 per share for the full year 2003. Additionally, Safeway expects to generate free cash flow from continuing operations (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow used by investing activities) of between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion for the year.
