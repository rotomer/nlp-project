UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D. C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): July 24, 2003 SAFEWAY INC. ------------ (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 1-00041 94-3019135 -------- ------- ---------- (State or other jurisdiction (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer of Incorporation) Identification Number) 5918 Stoneridge Mall Road, Pleasanton, California 94588-3229 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (925) 467-3000 -------------------------------------------------- (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) N/A -------------------------------------------------- (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)
Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. The following exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K: 99. Press Release dated July 24, 2003. Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information provided under Item 12 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition). Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216 dated March 27, 2003, the following information is being furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K. The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. On July 24, 2003, Safeway issued its second quarter 2003 earnings press release. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. In the press release, the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (defined as EBITDA from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change), adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of sales, interest coverage ratio and free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow used by investing activities). Management of the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and interest coverage ratio are important measures of operating performance because they assist investors in evaluating the Company's ability to service its debt. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of sales and interest coverage ratio also facilitate comparisons of the Company's results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the press release. Management believes that free cash flow is a useful indicator of the Company's ability to repay debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. A portion of the free cash flow the Company generates in 2003 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not accessible on a forward-looking basis and, as a result, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99 Contacts: Julie Hong (925) 467-3832 Safeway Inc. Announces Second-Quarter 2003 Earnings Company Reduces Debt by $651 Million During First 24 Weeks of 2003 PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 24, 2003--Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY) Results From Continuing Operations Safeway Inc. today reported income from continuing operations of $199.6 million ($0.45 per share) for the second quarter ended June 14, 2003. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2002 was $305.0 million ($0.62 per share). Included in results from continuing operations are pre-tax restructuring and other expenses totaling $15.8 million ($0.02 per share after-tax) in 2003. These expenses consist of severance costs related to the previously announced restructuring of the company's administrative offices, write-offs of software and employee buyouts. Included in results from continuing operations for 2002 were pre-tax expenses of $65.9 million ($0.08 per share after-tax) consisting of severance costs related to the restructuring of a labor contract, severance and transition costs associated with the centralization of marketing functions and charges associated with 10 store closures. Sales Second-quarter 2003 comparable store sales were flat while identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) declined 0.5%. Excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales declined 1.7% and identical store sales declined 2.2%. Sales were impacted by continued softness in the economy. Total sales increased to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion in the second quarter of 2002, primarily due to new store openings and additional fuel sales. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 144 basis points to 30.17% of sales in the second quarter of 2003 from gross profit of 31.61% in the second quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher shrink, higher fuel sales, transitional marketing issues and selected investments in pricing. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense increased 77 basis points to 24.85% of sales in the second quarter of 2003 compared to operating and administrative expense of 24.08% of sales in the second quarter of 2002. Increased expenses, primarily from health care and pension, combined with soft sales resulted in a 143 basis points increase in operating and administrative expense as a percent of sales. This increase was partially offset by a 66 basis-point decline in the previously discussed severance and asset write-offs in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $92.0 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $81.0 million in the second quarter of 2002 as lower interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings resulting from the repurchase of Safeway stock in 2002. The company used cash flow from operating activities to reduce total debt outstanding by $651 million to $7.7 billion from $8.3 billion at the beginning of 2003. Results from Discontinued Operations As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2002 management decided to sell Dominick's and exit the Chicago market. Accordingly, Dominick's results are presented as discontinued operations. Loss from discontinued operations was $38.6 million ($0.09 per share) in the second quarter of 2003, consisting of $4.7 million income from operations, $69.8 million adjustment to the estimated loss on disposal and $26.5 million income tax benefit. The final determination as to fair value of Dominick's and amount of tax benefit is dependent on a number of factors, including completion of the transaction, terms of sale, review by taxing authorities and changes in tax law. Income from discontinued operations was $4.3 million ($0.01 per share) in the second quarter of 2002. Income from discontinued operations includes all direct charges to operations at Dominick's as well as allocated interest expense. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, no depreciation was charged to discontinued operations after year-end 2002. Net Quarterly Results Net income for the second quarter of 2003 was $161.0 million ($0.36 per share). Net income for the second quarter of 2002 was $309.3 million ($0.63 per share). 24-Week Results For the first 24 weeks of 2003, sales increased 3% to $15.3 billion from $14.9 billion in 2002. The gross profit margin decreased 153 basis points to 29.98% in 2003 from 31.51% in 2002. Operating and administrative expense increased 86 basis points to 24.63% of sales from 23.77% in 2002. Capital Expenditures During the first 24 weeks of 2003, Safeway invested $370.0 million in cash capital expenditures, opened 22 new stores and closed 15 stores. For the year, the company expects to spend approximately $1.1 billion in cash capital expenditures while opening 35 to 40 new stores and completing approximately 100 remodels. Earnings Guidance Safeway expects its third-quarter earnings will be in a range of $0.47 to $0.50 per share and is comfortable with the consensus earnings estimate of $2.13 for full-year 2003 as published by First Call/Thomson Financial. Additionally, Safeway expects to generate free cash flow from continuing operations (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow used by investing activities) of between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion for the year.
