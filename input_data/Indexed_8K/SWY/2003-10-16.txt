Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. (c) Exhibits. The following exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K: 99. Press Release dated October 16, 2003. Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216 dated March 27, 2003, the following information is being furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K. The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. On October 16, 2003, we issued our third quarter 2003 earnings press release. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99. In the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures): - -- "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" which is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) excluding the following: -- LIFO expense; -- equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates, net; -- cumulative effect of accounting change; and -- loss (income) on discontinued operations, net of tax. - -- "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of sales" which is calculated by dividing "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" by sales. - -- "interest coverage ratio" which is calculated by dividing "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" by interest expense. - -- "free cash flow" which is calculated as net cash flow from operating activities less net cash flow used by investing activities. Reconciliations of "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures - net income (loss) and net cash flow from operating activities - are provided in the press release. These four measures provide information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business. 2
Management believes that "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes, the enumerated non-cash items and items related to discontinued operations from net income (loss) provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow. Management believes that "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that that store makes to operating performance. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry. "Free cash flow," "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" and the related ratios are useful indicators of our ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2003 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of performance, nor as alternatives to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" and "free cash flow" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Additional limitations include: - -- "Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures; - -- "Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and - -- Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and "adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations" does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. 3
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally. 4

EXHIBIT 99 Contacts: Julie Hong (925) 467-3832 Melissa Plaisance (925) 467-3136 Safeway Inc. Announces Third-Quarter 2003 Results; Company Reduces Debt by $871 Million During First 36 Weeks of 2003 PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2003--Safeway Inc. (NYSE:SWY) Results from Continuing Operations Safeway Inc. today reported income from continuing operations of $203.3 million ($0.46 per share) for the third quarter ended September 6, 2003. Included in results from continuing operations are employee buyout and severance costs, primarily in Alberta, Canada, totaling $9.7 million ($0.013 per share). Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2002 was $280.9 million ($0.60 per share). Sales Third-quarter 2003 comparable store sales increased 0.8% while identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) rose 0.2%. Excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales declined 0.9% and identical store sales declined 1.5%. Sales were impacted by continued softness in the economy. Total sales increased to $7.8 billion from $7.5 billion in the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to new store openings and additional fuel sales. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased 78 basis points to 29.98% of sales in the third quarter of 2003 from gross profit of 30.76% in the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher fuel sales, moderately higher shrink and increases in advertising expense. Operating and Administrative Expense Operating and administrative expense increased 91 basis points to 24.60% of sales in the third quarter of 2003 compared to operating and administrative expense of 23.69% of sales in the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to higher health care, pension and workers' compensation costs and the employee buyout discussed above, combined with soft sales. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $92.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 compared to $87.2 million in the third quarter of 2002 primarily due to less interest allocated to discontinued operations in 2003. In accordance with EITF 87-24, interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of Dominick's net assets to total Safeway net assets. Allocated interest decreased in the third quarter of 2003 because Dominick's net assets have decreased relative to total Safeway net assets. The company reduced total debt outstanding by $871 million to $7.46 billion from $8.33 billion at the beginning of 2003. Results from Discontinued Operations Since management's decision during the fourth quarter of 2002 to sell Dominick's and exit the Chicago market, Dominick's results have been presented as discontinued operations. Loss from discontinued operations was $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2003, consisting of $3.8 million income from operations, $4.8 million adjustment to the estimated loss on disposal and $0.2 million income tax benefit. The final determination as to fair value of Dominick's and amount of tax benefit is dependent on a number of factors, including completion of the transaction, terms of sale, review by taxing authorities and changes in tax law. Income from discontinued operations was $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2002. Income from discontinued operations includes all direct charges to operations at Dominick's as well as allocated interest expense. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, no depreciation was charged to discontinued operations after year-end 2002. Net Quarterly Results Net income for the third quarter of 2003 was $202.5 million ($0.45 per share). Net income for the third quarter of 2002 was $281.3 million ($0.60 per share). 36-Week Results For the first 36 weeks of 2003, sales increased 3% to $23.1 billion from $22.4 billion in 2002. The gross profit margin decreased 128 basis points to 29.98% in 2003 from 31.26% in 2002. Operating and administrative expense increased 87 basis points to 24.62% of sales from 23.75% in 2002. Through 36 weeks the company has also generated $927.6 million in free cash flow from continuing operations (net cash flow from operating activities less net cash flow used by investing activities). Capital Expenditures During the first 36 weeks of 2003, Safeway invested $566.7 million in cash capital expenditures, opened 31 new stores and closed 24 stores. For the year, the company expects to spend approximately $1.1 billion in cash capital expenditures while opening 35 to 40 new stores and completing approximately 100 remodels. Earnings Guidance Safeway expects its fourth-quarter earnings will be in the range of $0.66 to $0.69 per share, excluding the effect of the ongoing strike in Southern California.
