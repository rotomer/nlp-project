(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Underwriter, if a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Underwriter to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or 12
supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto. (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Banc of America Securities LLC and Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, 13
effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the aggregate net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint. (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages 14
that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities. 8. TERMINATION. This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by you to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, either of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) there has occurred a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services, (iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York or California shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State or California authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets or any calamity or crisis, that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus. 9. EFFECTIVENESS; DEFAULTING UNDERWRITERS. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bear to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any 15
Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder; provided, however, that no such reimbursement shall be required with respect to a termination of this Agreement by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 9. 10. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. 11. APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York. 12. HEADINGS. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement. [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS] 16

Attached hereto as Annex A is a true and correct copy of a specimen note (the "Form of 2-Year Note") representing the Company's 2.50% Notes Due 2005 (the "2-Year Notes"); attached hereto as Annex B is a true and correct copy of a specimen note (the "Form of 5-Year Note") representing the Company's 4.125% Notes Due 2008 (the "5-Year Notes"); and attached hereto as Annex C is a true and correct copy of a specimen note (the "Form of 2-Year Floating Rate Note") representing the Company's Floating Rate Notes Due 2005 (the "2-Year Floating Rate Notes"). The Form of 2-Year Note, the Form of 5-Year Note and the Form of 2-Year Floating Rate Note are herein collectively referred to as the "Forms of Notes." The 2-Year Notes, the 5-Year Notes and the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes are each a separate series of Securities under the Indenture and are referred to herein collectively as the "Notes." The Company is issuing initially $200 million aggregate principal amount of the 2-Year Notes, $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 5-Year Notes and $150 million aggregate principal amount of the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes. The Company may issue additional 2-Year Notes, 5-Year Notes and/or 2-Year Floating Rate Notes from time to time after the date hereof, and such Notes will be treated as part of the respective series of Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No additional 2-Year Notes, 5-Year Notes or 2-Year Floating Rate Notes may be issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to such 2-Year Notes, 5-Year Notes or 2-Year Floating Rate Notes . 2. The Forms of Notes set forth certain of the terms required to be set forth in this certificate pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Indenture, and said terms are incorporated herein by reference.

Lien, except: (i) Liens existing as of October 29, 2003 (the "Closing Date"); (ii) Liens granted after the Closing Date on any assets or properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing Indebtedness of the Company created in favor of the Holders of the Notes of such series; (iii) Liens securing Indebtedness of the Company which is incurred to extend, renew or refinance Indebtedness which is secured by Liens permitted to be incurred under the Indenture; provided that such Liens do not extend to or cover any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the property or assets securing the Indebtedness being refinanced and that the principal amount of such Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced; (iv) Permitted Liens; and (v) Liens created in substitution of or as replacements for any Liens permitted by the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), provided that, based on a good faith determination of an officer of the Company, the property or asset encumbered under any such substitute or replacement Lien is substantially similar in nature to the property or asset encumbered by the otherwise permitted Lien which is being replaced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company may, without securing any series of Notes, create, incur or permit to exist Liens which would otherwise be subject to the restrictions set forth in the preceding paragraph, if after giving effect thereto and at the time of determination, Exempted Debt does not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets or (ii) $350,000,000. Section 4.8 Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.

In addition to the covenants set forth in Article IV of the Indenture, each of the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes shall include the following additional covenant: "Section 4.9. Calculation Agent. The Company covenants and agrees that, so long as any of the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes remain outstanding, there shall at all times be a Calculation Agent for the purpose of the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes.

In addition to the definitions set forth in Article I of the Indenture, each of the 2-Year Notes, the 5-Year Notes and the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes shall include the following additional definitions, which, in the event of a conflict with the definition of terms in the Indenture, shall control: "Attributable Liens" means in connection with a sale and lease-back transaction the lesser of (a) the fair market value of the assets subject to such transaction and (b) the present value (discounted at a rate per annum equal to the average interest borne by all outstanding Securities issued under the Indenture determined on a weighted average basis and compounded semi-annually) of the obligations of the lessee for rental payments during the term of the related lease.

to the Trustee and the Holders not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner.

If this Security is a Global Security, the interest payable on this Security will be paid to Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, or its registered assigns as the registered owner of this Security, by wire transfer of immediately available funds on each of the applicable interest payment dates. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

Gordon Executive Vice President and Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer Secretary TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION This is one of the Floating Rate Notes Due 2005 described in the within-mentioned Indenture. THE BANK OF NEW YORK BY ______________________________ AUTHORIZED SIGNATORY
SAFEWAY INC. Floating Rate Note Due 2005 1. General. This Security is one of a duly authorized series of securities of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 10, 1997, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, originally issued in $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount, subject to increase in accordance with the Indenture (herein called the "Securities"). All terms used but not defined in this Security shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 2. Indenture. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by the Officers' Certificate dated October 29, 2003 delivered pursuant thereto and the TIA. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and the Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. 3. Sinking Fund. The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund. 4. Redemption. The Securities are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. 5. Interest Calculation. Interest on this Security will accrue from, and including, October 29, 2003, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period"). The amount of accrued interest for any Interest Period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from October 29, 2003, or from the last date the Company paid interest, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360. If the Stated Maturity of this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company shall pay principal and interest on the next succeeding Business Day, but will deem that payment was made on the date that the payment was due. No interest will accrue for the period beginning on the Stated Maturity to the payment date on such next Business Day. The interest rate on this Security will be reset quarterly, will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be equal to LIBOR plus 0.470%, except that the interest rate will not exceed the rate permitted by applicable law. The Interest Determination Date for an Interest Period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such Interest Period. Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee of the interest rate for the next Interest Period. Absent manifest
error, the determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holder hereof. "Business Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in the City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close; provided that the day is also a "London business day." "London business day" means any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market. "LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions: (i) With respect to any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period that appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears, then LIBOR, in respect to that Interest Determination Date, will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (ii) below. (ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (i) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in the City of New York, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in the City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by this sentence, LIBOR determined as of that Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on that Interest Determination Date. "Moneyline Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars. "Calculation Agency Agreement" means the Calculation Agency Agreement dated as of October 29, 2003 by and between The Bank of New York and the Company, as such agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time. "Calculation Agent" means The Bank of New York, or such other Person as the Company shall from time to time designate in accordance with the Calculation Agency Agreement. 6. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer, or the exchange for an equal principal amount, of this Security is registrable with the Registrar upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Registrar.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may, subject to certain exceptions, require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 7. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 8. Unclaimed Money. The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal and interest that remains unclaimed for two years. After that, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. 9. Defeasance Prior to Maturity. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Securities or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Securities, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein. 10. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into a supplemental indenture with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities), for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Securityholders. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities) may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of the Indenture or the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. 11. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the Company's and its Subsidiaries' ability to create or incur certain Liens on any of their respective properties or assets and to enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and on the Company's ability to engage in mergers or consolidations or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its properties and assets. These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and reference is made to the Indenture for a description thereof. 12. Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared (or, in certain cases, shall ipso facto become) due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 13. Proceedings. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or for the
appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy under the Indenture, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities and unless also the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities at the time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute such proceeding, within 60 days. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of the principal hereof or any interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. 14. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 15. No Recourse Against Others. A past, present or future director, officer, employee, shareholder or incorporator, as such, of the Company or any successor corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Security or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration of issuance of the Securities. 16. Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and the Securities.

This Security is one of a duly authorized series of securities of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 10, 1997, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, originally issued in $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount, subject to increase in accordance with the Indenture (herein called the "Securities"). All terms used but not defined in this Security shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. 2. Indenture. The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by the Officers' Certificate dated October 29, 2003 delivered pursuant thereto and the TIA. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and the Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them. 3. Sinking Fund. The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund and the Securities are not subject to redemption or repurchase by the Company at the option of the Holders. 4. Redemption. The Securities are redeemable in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Securities to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points. In each case the Company will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Securities. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Banc of America Securities LLC and Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. and their respective successors, and two other firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer") which the Company specifies from time to time; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. 5. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer, or the exchange for an equal principal amount, of this Security is registrable with the Registrar upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Registrar. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may, subject to certain exceptions, require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 6. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 7. Unclaimed Money. The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal and interest that remains unclaimed for two years. After that, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. 8. Defeasance Prior to Maturity. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Securities or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Securities, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein. 9. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into a supplemental indenture with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities (including consents obtained in connection with
a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities), for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Securityholders. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities) may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of the Indenture or the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. 10. Restrictive Covenants. The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the Company's and its Subsidiaries' ability to create or incur certain Liens on any of their respective properties or assets and to enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and on the Company's ability to engage in mergers or consolidations or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its properties and assets. These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and reference is made to the Indenture for a description thereof. 11. Defaults and Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared (or, in certain cases, shall ipso facto become) due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. 12. Proceedings. As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy under the Indenture, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities and unless also the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities at the time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute such proceeding, within 60 days. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of the principal hereof or any interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein. 13. Trustee Dealings with Company. The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 14. No Recourse Against Others. A past, present or future director, officer, employee, shareholder or incorporator, as such, of the Company or any successor corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Security or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration of issuance of the Securities. 15. Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and the Securities.
