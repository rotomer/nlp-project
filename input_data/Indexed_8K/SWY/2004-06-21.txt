Directors and executive officers are prohibited from directly or indirectly purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any shares of Safeway Common Stock during the Upgrade Blackout Period, if the shares were acquired or would be acquired in connection with services provided to, or employment with, Safeway. To ensure compliance with this requirement, you are instructed not to engage in any transaction in Safeway Common Stock during the Upgrade Blackout Period.
