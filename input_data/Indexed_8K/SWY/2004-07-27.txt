(c) Exhibits.
 
The following exhibit is furnished pursuant to Item 12 of Form 8-K:
 
 
Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8216 dated March 27, 2003, the following information is being furnished under Item 12 of Form 8-K. The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
On July 27, 2004, we issued our second quarter 2004 earnings press release. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "adjusted earnings per share" to GAAP earnings per share and "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of "Adjusted EBITDA" to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income (loss) and net cash flow from operating activities  also are provided in the press release. These five measures provide information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that that store makes to operating performance.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
 
The non-cash charges included in "adjusted earnings per share" relate to (i) restructuring and other expenses, and (ii) Dominick's long-lived asset impairment charges. The adjustments are described in the press release. Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such expenses are incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the non-cash charges or strike effects that we have experienced.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "adjusted earnings per share" as an indicator of our ongoing operating performance.
 
"Free cash flow", Adjusted EBITDA and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2004 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
 
Our estimate of earnings per share for 2004 (without giving effect to the impact of the Southern California strike, store closures at Dominick's and a contribution to two Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plans) is used by management as a baseline for estimating our 2004 net income per share (EPS). The previously announced closure of 12 Dominick's stores reduced earnings in the first quarter of 2004 by $0.06 per share. Management is unable to estimate the effect that the Southern California strike will have on EPS for 2004, and therefore is not able to provide any reconciliation of any amounts set forth herein with respect to the effect of the Southern California strike. The expected $30 million contribution to two Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plans would impact 2004 EPS by $0.07 per share, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding on July 23, 2004.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP earnings per share as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "adjusted earnings per share", "free cash flow" and "Adjusted EBITDA" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Results From Operation
 
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $155.2 million ($0.35 per diluted share) for the second quarter ended June 19, 2004. This result includes the estimated impact of approximately $50 million, after tax ($0.11 per share) as the Company recovers from the strike in Southern California. Excluding the impact of the strike recovery, second quarter 2004 earnings were $0.46 per share.
 
Net income was $161.0 million ($0.36 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2003. Included in these results were an impairment charge for Dominick's of $41.6 million, after tax ($0.10 per share) and restructuring and other expenses totaling $9.9 million, after tax ($0.02 per share). Excluding these items, second quarter 2003 earnings were $0.48 per share.
 
"Despite the strike, Safeway generated over $1.0 billion in cash from operations in the first two quarters of the year, up slightly from last year," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "Going forward, we will continue to focus on recovering from the effects of the strike and differentiating our offerings to provide superior value to our customers."
 
Strike Recovery
 
On October 11, 2003 seven UFCW local unions struck the company's 289 stores in Southern California. An agreement ending the strike was reached on February 26, 2004. As expected, promotional pricing, direct marketing and the introduction of new proprietary products, such as Ranchers Reserve Beef, have improved sales in Southern California, but not yet to pre-strike levels.
 
Sales
 
Total sales increased to $8.4 billion in the second quarter of 2004 from $8.2 billion in 2003, primarily due to additional fuel sales and new store openings. Excluding sales at strike-affected stores, comparable store sales increased 2.3% and identical store (which exclude replacement stores) sales increased 1.9%. Further, excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales were flat and identical store sales declined 0.4%.
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit decreased 136 basis points to 28.75% of sales in the second quarter of 2004 from 30.11% in the second quarter of 2003. The estimated impact of the strike reduced gross profit by 63 basis points. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 80 basis points. Higher advertising expense reduced gross profit by 23 basis points. The remaining 30 basis point increase in non-fuel gross profit was primarily attributable to improved shrink and lower cost of goods.
 
Operating and Administrative Expense
 
Operating and administrative expense declined 82 basis points to 24.96% of sales in the second quarter of 2004 from 25.78% in the second quarter of 2003. The Dominick's impairment charge, restructuring charges and other expenses in 2003 increased operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by 104 basis points. The strike in 2004 increased operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by an estimated 23 basis points. Excluding these items, operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was essentially flat compared to last year.
 
For most of the 2003 fiscal year, Dominick's was classified as an asset held for sale. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Safeway announced that Dominick's was no longer held for sale. As a result, the second quarter 2003 estimated loss on disposal has been reclassified as a 2003 operating and administrative expense.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense declined to $95.5 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to $102.0 million in the second quarter of 2003 primarily because the company reduced debt by $584 million from $7.8 billion at year-end 2003 to $7.2 billion at June 19, 2004.
 
Income Tax Expense
 
Income tax expense was $71.0 million, or 31.4% of pretax income, in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $97.1 million, or 37.6%, in the second quarter of 2003. Safeway's effective tax rate declined in the second quarter of 2004 due to a tax benefit of $12.5 million arising from the resolution of various tax issues.
 
24-Week Results
 
Net income for the first 24 weeks of 2004 was $198.3 million ($0.44 per diluted share) compared to $323.6 million ($0.73 per diluted share) for the first 24 weeks of 2003. The strike in Southern California reduced net income for the first 24 weeks of 2004 by an estimated $0.38 per share. Primarily as a result of the strike, sales declined 1.8% to $16.0 billion in the first 24 weeks of 2004 from $16.3 billion in 2003. The gross profit margin decreased 66 basis points to 29.25% in 2004 from 29.91% in 2003. Operating and administrative expense increased 85 basis points to 26.30% of sales from 25.45% in 2003.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
During the first 24 weeks of 2004, Safeway invested $479.4 million in cash capital expenditures. For the year, the company expects to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in cash capital expenditures and open approximately 40 new stores and complete 120 remodels.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash flow from operating activities was $1,047.7 million for the first 24 weeks of 2004 compared to $1,023.8 million for the first 24 weeks of 2003. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased to $432.1 million for the first 24 weeks of 2004 compared to $338.6 million in 2003. Net cash flow used by financing activities, which consists principally of cash used to pay down debt, was $576.4 million for the first 24 weeks of 2004 and $676.9 million in 2003.
 
Guidance
 
At the investor conference in December 2003, Safeway provided earnings guidance for 2004 in the range of $1.95 to $2.03 per share and free cash flow guidance of $700 million to $900 million. This guidance excluded the impact of the labor dispute in Southern California and the effect of 12 store closures at Dominick's in the first quarter of 2004. Additionally, Safeway was recently notified that it will be required to contribute an additional $30 million to two Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plans for its share of funding deficits in the second half of 2004. Excluding those items, Safeway is tracking at the lower end of the EPS range and within the range on cash flow.
