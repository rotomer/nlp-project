Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions ( General Instruction A.2. below):
see
 
 
 
 
 
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibits, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
On December 8, 2004, we will hold our annual investor conference, at which slides regarding our recent performance, strategy to restore growth, progress on executing the strategy and financial outlook will be presented. Copies of certain of the slides are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the investor conference presentation, the press release, and our other public statements in connection with the presentation and the press release, we used the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow are provided in the press release and in this report on Form 8-K. Reconciliations of "adjusted operating profit" to reported operating profit, "adjusted earnings per share" to reported earnings per share, "adjusted net cash flow from operations" to reported net cash flow from operating activities, and "free cash flow from 1998 to 2003" to GAAP cash flow for years 1998 to 2003 are provided in this report on Form 8-K. Each of these non-GAAP measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
 
Management believes that excluding certain non-cash charges and other items in "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted earnings per share" and "adjusted net cash flow from operations" provides useful financial measures that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such expenses are incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the non-cash charges, health and welfare plan contribution and strike effects that we have experienced.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted earnings per share" and "adjusted net cash flow from operations" as indicators of our ongoing operating performance.
 
"Free cash flow" is a useful indicator of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2004 and 2005 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP earnings per share as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures
 
have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "adjusted operating profit", "adjusted earnings per share", "free cash flow" and other non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PLEASANTON, Calif.(BUSINESS WIRE)December 8, 2004Safeway Inc. (NYSE: SWY) will hold a conference for analysts and institutional investors today. Safeway will review its recent performance, its strategy to restore growth, its progress on executing the strategy, and its financial outlook.
 
For the year 2005, the company is initiating earnings per share guidance of $1.50 - $1.60, excluding the expensing of stock options. As previously announced, the company will expense stock options for the first time beginning in 2005. The estimated impact of expensing stock options is $0.09 per share for the year. As a result, reported earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.41 - $1.51. The company anticipates a gradual strike recovery at Vons and a significant increase in brand building and other marketing investments designed to improve sales. In 2005, the Vons strike is projected to have a lingering impact on earnings of approximately $0.20 per share compared to pre-strike results, and incremental marketing expenditures are projected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.20 per share. The company expects to generate non-fuel identical store sales growth of 1.2% to 1.5% in 2005, excluding Vons in the first quarter.
 
The company will discuss its plans to spend approximately $1.4 billion in cash capital expenditures in 2005, to open 30-35 new stores and to remodel 275 to 285 stores. Square footage growth is expected to be approximately 1%. Due primarily to higher expected net cash flows used by investing activities in 2005 versus 2004, the company expects to generate free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less cash flow used by investing activities) in 2005 in the range of $500 million to $700 million.
 
"We made substantial progress in differentiating our offering in 2004, and we plan to step up those efforts in 2005. We have made dramatic improvements in our perishable departments, have grown our proprietary products substantially, and have confirmed the value of our store remodel program. We also expect to benefit from the significant progress we made in restructuring our labor contracts and from our improved organizational structure," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "In 2005, we plan to make substantial brand building and other marketing investments to improve sales momentum. We are confident that these actions will restore growth to our business in 2005 and beyond."
Safeway Inc. is a Fortune 50 company and one of the largest food and drug retailers in North America. The company operates 1,815 stores in the United States and Canada and had sales of $35.6 billion in 2003. The company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SWY.
 
The investor conference will be broadcast live over the Internet from 7:30 AM (PST) to approximately 11:30 AM (PST) at http://www.safeway.com/investor_relations. Click on Webcast Events to access the event. The presentation will be available in an archived format for one week after the meeting.
