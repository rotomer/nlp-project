Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
On February 24, 2005, we issued our fourth quarter 2004 earnings press release. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "adjusted earnings per share" to GAAP earnings per share and "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of "Adjusted EBITDA" to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  also are provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that that store makes to operating performance.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
 
The non-cash charges included in "adjusted earnings per share" relate to (i) goodwill and asset impairment charges at Dominick's and Randall's, (ii) an expense adjustment for lease rent holidays, (iii) miscellaneous investments write-off, and (iv) inventory adjustments. These non-cash and all other adjustments are described in the press release. Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such expenses are incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the non-cash charges, store closures, health and welfare plan contribution and strike effects that we have experienced.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "adjusted earnings per share" as an indicator of our ongoing operating performance.
 
"Free cash flow", Adjusted EBITDA and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing
 
activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2005 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP earnings per share as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "adjusted earnings per share", "free cash flow" and "Adjusted EBITDA" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
 
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $202.7 million ($0.45 per diluted share) for the 16-week fourth quarter ended January 1, 2005. In the 17-week fourth quarter of 2003, Safeway reported a net loss of $695.9 million ($1.57 per diluted share).
 
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 includes a total charge of approximately $47.2 million, after tax ($0.11 per diluted share), consisting of the estimated impact from the strike in Southern California, contributions to a Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plan, and an accrual for rent holidays in accordance with recent SEC guidance. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter 2004 earnings would have been $0.56 per diluted share.
 
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2003 included a total of $991.5 million of after-tax charges ($2.23 per diluted share) outlined on Table 1. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter 2003 earnings would have been $0.66 per diluted share.
 
"Our 2004 earnings were largely as expected, and we are very pleased that the cash generated by the business significantly exceeded expectations, allowing us to reduce debt by $1.1 billion," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "During the year, we were also hard at work reinventing our business, dramatically improving the quality of our produce and meat, expanding our offering of proprietary items in deli and food service and developing a store remodeling concept that highlights these changes. Our new remodel program provides a warm and comfortable shopping experience that has been well received by our customers. During 2004, we also made substantial progress restructuring labor contracts, which we believe will allow us to compete more effectively in the future."
 
"As we look ahead, we are very encouraged with the prospects for our business," added Burd. "Our first-quarter identical store sales (excluding fuel and strike-affected stores)
are currently running at 1.4%, and we expect reported identical store sales for the full quarter to be 2% or better, with an estimated benefit of approximately 1% from pre-Easter sales in the last week of the first quarter of 2005. We believe this sales improvement is a direct result of the strategy initiated more than 15 months ago, and we expect these positive sales to continue as the year progresses."
 
Reclassification
 
Historically, Safeway has classified certain minor revenue items such as partner gift card and vending machine income as a reduction of costs and expenses. As the value of these items has grown, the company has determined that they are more appropriately classified as other revenue.
 
These reclassifications have had no effect on operating profit or net income and very little effect on comparable store sales. Table 4 presents those reclassifications to the 2004 and 2003 income statements.
 
Sales
 
Total sales increased to $11.4 billion in the 16-week fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $11.0 billion in the 17-week quarter of 2003, primarily as a result of the recovery from the strike and increased fuel sales. Excluding sales at strike-affected stores, comparable store sales increased 1.5% and identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) increased 1.1% for the fourth quarter of 2004. Further, excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales declined 0.3% and identical store sales declined 0.7% for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit was 29.47% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to 29.43 % in the fourth quarter of 2003. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 43 basis points, and the estimated impact of the strike reduced gross profit by 15 basis points. Gross profit in 2003 was reduced 64 basis points due to the charge to accrue estimated physical inventory losses. Excluding these items, gross profit was essentially flat.
 
Operating and Administrative Expense
 
Operating and administrative expense declined 216 basis points to 25.90% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 28.06% in the fourth quarter of 2003. This decline consisted primarily of 186 basis points due to lower impairment charges, an estimated 83 basis points from the strike recovery and 13 basis points from higher fuel sales, offset by 9 basis points from the accrual for rent holidays and 57 basis points primarily from higher wages, benefits and occupancy expense.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense declined to $123.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $135.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily because the company has reduced debt by $1.1 billion from $7.8 billion at year-end 2003 to $6.7 billion at year-end 2004.
 
Income Tax Expense
 
Income tax expense was $101.2 million, or 33.3% of pretax income, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Income tax expense includes a tax benefit of $8.8 million due to tax law changes and the resolution of certain tax issues during the quarter.
 
Annual Results
 
Net income for the year ended 2004 was $560.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share) compared to a loss of $169.8 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for 2003.
 
Net income in 2004 includes a total estimated impact of approximately $304.8 million, after tax ($0.68 per diluted share) from the after-tax charges outlined in Table 1. Excluding these items, 2004 earnings would have been $1.93 per diluted share.
 
Net loss for 2003 included a total of $1,083.0 million of after-tax charges ($2.43 per diluted share) outlined on Table 1. Excluding these items, net income in 2003 was $2.05 per diluted share.
 
Sales increased only slightly to $35.8 billion in 2004 from $35.7 billion in 2003, primarily because of the strike and because fiscal 2004 had one fewer week than fiscal 2003. The gross profit margin decreased 44 basis points to 29.58% in 2004 from 30.02% in 2003. Operating and administrative expense decreased 7 basis points to 26.30% of sales from 26.37% in 2003.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
During 2004, Safeway invested $1.2 billion in cash capital expenditures. The company opened 33 new lifestyle stores, completed 94 lifestyle remodels and closed 48 stores. In 2005, the company expects to spend approximately $1.4 billion in cash capital expenditures and open approximately 30 to 35 new lifestyle stores and complete approximately 275 to 285 lifestyle remodels.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash flow from operating activities increased to $2,226.4 million in 2004 from $1,609.6 million in 2003.
 
Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased to $1,070.3 million for 2004 compared to $795.0 million in 2003.
 
Net cash flow used by financing activities, which consists principally of cash used to pay down debt, was $1,077.6 million in 2004 and $724.0 million in 2003. Total debt declined by $1.1 billion to $6.7 billion in 2004 from $7.8 billion in 2003.
 
Guidance
 
Safeway confirms 2005 guidance of $1.41 to $1.51 per diluted share which includes an estimated stock option expense of $0.09 per diluted share. In addition, the company expects to generate free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million in 2005 compared to $1,156.1 million in 2004. Free cash flow will be less in 2005 compared to 2004 because of reduced working capital improvements and increased capital expenditures.
