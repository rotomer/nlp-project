Pleasanton, CA  May 25, 2005  The Board of Directors of Safeway Inc. (NYSE: SWY) today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share, payable on July 7, 2005 to shareholders of record as of June 16, 2005. This represents the first cash dividend paid to shareholders since the company's IPO in 1990. The quarterly dividend pay out will total approximately $22.5 million. Assuming the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends in the same amount, the total annual pay out would equal approximately $90 million.
 
"The Board's decision to initiate a quarterly dividend while we continue to fund our extensive store remodel program and reduce debt is a sign of its confidence in our strategy and anticipated strong cash flow from operations," said Steve Burd Chairman, President and CEO. "We remain committed to improving debt protection measures while enhancing the return to shareholders."
