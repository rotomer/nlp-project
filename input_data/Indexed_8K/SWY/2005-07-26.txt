Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
On July 26, 2005, we issued our second quarter 2005 earnings press release. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow, "Adjusted EBITDA" to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  and "Adjusted Debt" are provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that that store makes to operating performance.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
 
"Free cash flow", "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2005 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "free cash flow", "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted Debt" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
 
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $134.0 million ($0.30 per diluted share) for the second quarter ended June 18, 2005 compared to $155.2 million ($0.35 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2004.
 
Earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005 were flat compared to the second quarter of 2004, after excluding stock option expense of $0.02 per diluted share in 2005 and an income tax benefit of $0.03 per diluted share in 2004.
 
"Our strategy to differentiate our offering has resulted in broad-based sales improvement," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "Consumers have responded enthusiastically to the improved quality of our perishables, to our proprietary brands, to the greater everyday value we have brought to the center of our store, and to our Lifestyle stores. We have improved non-fuel identical store sales eight of the last ten quarters and experienced two consecutive quarters of markedly positive non-fuel identical store sales, which we believe confirms the strategy is working."
 
Sales and Other Revenue
 
Total sales increased 4.7% to $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2005 from $8.4 billion in the second quarter of 2004. Safeway's marketing strategies and the recovery from last year's strike in Southern California drove this sales increase. However, a shift in Easter holiday sales, which occurred in the second quarter of last year compared to the first quarter of this year, reduced the sales increase.
Comparable store sales increased 3.3% and identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) increased 2.8% for the second quarter of 2005. Further, excluding the effect of fuel sales, identical store sales increased 1.4%. When adjusted for the Easter holiday, non-fuel identical store sales increased 2.6%.
 
Gross Profit
 
Gross profit margin declined 42 basis points to 28.74% of sales in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 29.16% in the second quarter of 2004. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 36 basis points. The recovery from the strike in Southern California improved gross margin but was offset by increased advertising, investments in price and other expenses.
 
Operating and Administrative Expense
 
Operating and administrative expense improved 9 basis points to 25.30% of sales in the second quarter of 2005 from 25.39% in the second quarter of 2004. This improvement is primarily due to the ongoing recovery from the strike at Vons, increased sales from fuel and restructured labor agreements, offset by stock option expense, labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores, higher retail bonus accruals and other store operating costs.
 
In 2005, Safeway early adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (revised 2004), which requires that stock options be expensed. The noncash expense for stock options was $17.7 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2005.
Share-Based Payment,
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense was $94.5 million in the second quarter of 2005, down slightly from $95.5 million in the second quarter of 2004. Indebtedness was lower in the second quarter of 2005 compared to the second quarter of 2004, while average interest rates were higher.
 
Income Tax Expense
 
Income tax expense was $82.4 million, or 38.1% of pretax income, in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of 2004. Safeway's effective tax rate was lower in the second quarter of 2004 due to a tax benefit of $12.5 million arising from the favorable resolution of various tax issues.
 
24-Week Results
 
Net income for the first 24 weeks of 2005 was $265.3 million ($0.59 per diluted share) compared to $198.3 million ($0.44 per diluted share) in the first 24 weeks of 2004. The gross profit margin was 28.98% in 2005 compared to 29.66% in 2004. Operating and administrative expense was 25.55% of sales in 2005 compared to 26.73% of sales in 2004.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Safeway invested $515.1 million in capital expenditures in the first 24 weeks of 2005. The company opened eight new Lifestyle stores and completed 83 Lifestyle remodels. For the year, the company has increased expected capital expenditures to approximately $1.5 billion from $1.4 billion. The company expects to open approximately 25 new Lifestyle stores and complete approximately 290 to 295 Lifestyle remodels. By year-end 2005, approximately 25% of Safeway's store base will be in the Lifestyle format.
 
Cash Flow
 
Net cash flow from operating activities was $671.8 million in the first 24 weeks of 2005 compared to $1,047.7 million in the first 24 weeks of 2004. This change was primarily because of higher income tax payments in 2005 and lower prepaid expense and receivables in 2004.
 
Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $484.7 million for the first 24 weeks of 2005 compared to $432.1 million in 2004.
 
Financing activities, which consist primarily of cash used to pay down debt, used cash flow of $131.9 million in the first 24 weeks of 2005 compared to $576.4 million in 2004.
 
Quarterly Dividend
 
On July 7, 2005, Safeway paid a dividend of $0.05 per common share to shareholders of record as of June 16, 2005. The payout totaled $22.4 million.
 
Guidance
 
Safeway is raising guidance for 2005 identical store sales (excluding fuel) to a range of 2.5% to 2.8% from the previously provided range of 1.2% to 1.5%. The company is comfortable with current analyst consensus earnings estimates of $1.45 per diluted share for 2005 (excluding any voluntary employee buyouts) as posted by Thomson First Call.
 
As a result of the $100 million increase in forecasted capital spending in the second half of 2005, the company's expected free cash flow is being narrowed to a range of $500 million to $600 million for the year.
