Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On February 23, 2006, we issued our fourth quarter earnings press release. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "adjusted income and adjusted earnings per diluted share" to GAAP net income and "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for 2005 and 2004 are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  also are provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
The exclusions included in "adjusted income and adjusted earnings per diluted share" relate to impairment charges at our Texas stores, closing costs relating to store closures, the employee buyouts, health and welfare benefit contributions, accrual for rent holidays and pro forma stock option expense. Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such expenses are incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the non-cash charges, closing costs, employee buyouts, health and welfare benefit contributions and accrual for rent holidays that we have experienced. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "adjusted income and adjusted earnings per diluted share" as an indicator of our ongoing operating performance. Management is unable to estimate the effect that any voluntary employee buyouts will have on guidance for 2006 of earnings per diluted share, and therefore is not able to provide any reconciliation of any amounts set forth herein with respect to any voluntary employee buyouts in 2006.
Management believes that adjusted operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our adjusted operating and administrative expense before, during and after the unusual or unpredictable expenses are incurred, as well as facilitate comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the non-cash charges, store closures, health and welfare benefit contributions and employee buyouts that we have experienced.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that that store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
"Free cash flow," "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in 2006 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures. Management is unable to estimate the effect that any voluntary employee buyouts will have on guidance for 2006 of free cash flow, and therefore is not able to provide any reconciliation of any amounts set forth herein with respect to any voluntary employee buyouts in 2006.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "free cash flow," "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted Debt" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $173.5 million ($0.39 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the quarter was reduced by a total of $0.12 per diluted share for previously announced store exit activities in Texas and employee buyouts primarily in Dominick's and Northern California. These items are outlined on Table 1 of this release.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $202.7 million ($0.45 per diluted share). Net income for the quarter was reduced by a total of $0.02 per diluted share for contributions to a Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plan and an accrual for rent holidays. In addition, pro forma stock option expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 was $0.02 per diluted share. These items are outlined on Table 1.
"We are very pleased with our 2005 results," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "When adjusted for Easter, our same store sales grew stronger each quarter and we increased market share in the U.S. supermarket channel 51 of 52 weeks in 2005. We also completed the restructuring of our labor contracts and are beginning to experience solid operating and administrative expense leverage."
Sales
Total sales increased 5.8% to $12.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $11.4 billion in 2004. Safeway's marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales drove this sales increase. Comparable store sales increased 5.4% and identical store sales (which exclude replacement stores) increased 5.1% for the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the effect of fuel sales, comparable store sales increased 3.9% and identical store sales increased 3.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Lifestyle Stores
Lifestyle stores have contributed significantly to sales growth throughout 2005. As expected, the cost of promoting Lifestyle openings reduced gross margin and increased operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. The company expects that
as the Lifestyle stores opened in 2005 mature in 2006, their margins will improve and they will contribute at a higher level to Safeway's operating profit.
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 36 basis points to 29.11% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 29.47% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 27 basis points. Higher energy costs reduced gross profit by 4 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005. The remaining decline is the result of the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and targeted investments in price, offset by improved shrink.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense increased 8 basis points to 25.98% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 25.90% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, Safeway incurred previously announced pretax charges of $55.5 million for store exit activities related to the closure of 26 Texas stores and $37.5 million for employee buyouts. Adjusting for these charges and other unusual and pro forma charges in 2004 as outlined in Table 7 of this release, operating and administrative expense improved 69 basis points.
This improvement in operating and administrative expense is primarily the result of increased sales (including fuel sales), restructured labor agreements and reduced workers' compensation costs, partly offset by labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and higher energy costs. Higher energy costs increased operating and administrative expense by 6 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $124.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $123.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Lower debt was offset by an increase in the average interest rate from 5.76% to 6.32%.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $94.6 million, or 35.3% of pretax income, in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to $101.2 million, or 33.3% of pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2004. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 included $7.3 million of tax benefits ($0.02 per diluted share) associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax issues. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2004 included a tax benefit of $8.8 million ($0.02 per diluted share) due to tax law changes and the favorable resolution of certain tax issues.
Annual Results
Net income for the year ended 2005 was $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) compared to $560.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2004. Sales increased 7.2% to $38.4 billion in 2005 from $35.8 billion in 2004, primarily because of Safeway's marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution and increased fuel sales.
 
The gross profit margin decreased 65 basis points to 28.93% of sales in 2005 from 29.58% in 2004. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 39 basis points. The remaining decline is due to grand openings of Lifestyle stores, investment in price, increased advertising expense and higher energy costs.
Operating and administrative expense decreased 53 basis points to 25.77% of sales from 26.30% in 2004. Excluding the unusual items outlined on Table 7, operating and administrative expense decreased 94 basis points. This improvement is the result of restructured labor agreements, increased fuel sales, and reduced workers' compensation costs, partly offset by labor costs associated with the grand opening of Lifestyle stores and higher energy costs.
Capital Expenditures
During 2005, Safeway invested $1.4 billion in cash capital expenditures. The company opened 21 new Lifestyle stores, completed 293 Lifestyle remodels and closed 48 stores. In 2006, the company expects to spend approximately $1.6 billion in cash capital expenditures, open approximately 20 to 25 new Lifestyle stores and complete approximately 280 Lifestyle remodels.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities was $1,881.0 million in 2005 compared to $2,226.4 million in 2004. Working capital contributed to cash flow in 2005, but at a lower level than in 2004.
Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased to $1,313.5 million in 2005 from $1,070.3 million in 2004.
Net cash flow used by financing activities, which consists principally of cash used to pay down debt, was $466.9 million in 2005 and $1,077.6 million in 2004.
Free cash flow was $567.5 million in 2005. As a result, debt declined $404.8 million, cash and equivalents increased $106.5 million and the company paid $44.9 million in dividends to its stockholders.
Guidance
Safeway confirms guidance for 2006 of $1.55 to $1.65 earnings per diluted share and free cash flow of $400 million to $600 million, both excluding employee buyouts. Non-fuel identical store sales are expected to grow 3.0%. The timing of holidays is expected to affect the quarterly pattern of sales and earnings in the first half of 2006. Shopping for the Easter holiday occurred in the first quarter of the 2005, but will occur in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Quarterly Dividend
On January 20, 2006, Safeway paid a dividend of $0.05 per common share to stockholders of record as of December 30, 2005. The payout was $22.5 million.
