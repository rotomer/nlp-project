(ix) Each of the Incorporated Documents, as of its respective filing or effective date, appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the applicable requirements for reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and proxy statements under Regulation 14A, as the case may be, under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and for Registration Statements on Form 8-A under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder applicable to the portion incorporated; it being understood, however, that such firm need express no opinion with respect to Regulation S-T or the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included in, incorporated by reference in, or omitted from such reports, proxy statements and registration statements or with respect to the Form T-1. In passing upon the compliance as to form of the Incorporated Documents, such firm may assume that the statements made therein are correct and complete.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel may state that they express an opinion only as to federal laws, New York and California law and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such opinion may also be subject to customary assumptions and limitations, including that opinions on enforceability may be subject to the following exceptions, limitations and qualifications: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be brought; (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; (iv) such counsel need not express an opinion concerning the enforceability of the waiver of rights or defenses contained in Section 4.4 of the Indenture; (v) such counsel need not express an opinion with respect to Sections 10.15 and 10.16 of the Indenture; (vi) such counsel need not express an opinion with respect to whether acceleration of the Notes may affect the collectibility of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon; (vii) the unenforceability of any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy; and (viii) such counsel need not express an opinion as to whether the fourth paragraph of section 7.7 of the Indenture is sufficient to create a security interest in favor of the Trustee on any of the assets or property referenced therein.
In addition, such counsel shall provide a separate letter to the effect that such counsel has reviewed the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and Prospectus and the Incorporated Documents, participated in conferences and, if applicable, telephone conversations with officers and other representatives of the Company, the independent public accountants for the Company, and representatives of the Underwriters and counsel to the Underwriters, during which conferences and, if applicable, conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and portions of certain of the Incorporated Documents and related matters were discussed, and reviewed and relied upon certain corporate records and documents, letters from counsel and accountants, and oral and written statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and others as to the existence and consequence of certain factual and other matters, and, although such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents (except to the extent expressly set forth in (vii) above) and has not made any independent check or verification thereof (except as aforesaid), based on such participation, review and reliance, no facts came to such counsel's attention that
 
caused such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at each deemed effective date with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to Rule 430B(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations (in each case, together with the Incorporated Documents and, the Rule 430B Information), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the Closing Date (together with the Incorporated Documents), contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or that the General Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time (together with the Incorporated Documents), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no belief with respect to Regulation S-T, the financial statements, schedules or other financial data included or incorporated by reference in, or omitted from, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the Incorporated Documents or the Form T-1.
(d) Robert A. Gordon, Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to you his written opinion, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to you, to the effect that:
(i) the Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of substantial properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and in which the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its subsidiaries considered as a whole;

(iii) to the best of such counsel's knowledge there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject, required to be described in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, which are not described as required; and
(iv) the issue and sale of the Securities being delivered at the Closing Date by the Company and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as contemplated under "Use of Proceeds" in the Statutory Prospectus forming a part of the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus Supplement, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement will not conflict with or result in a material breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument relating to indebtedness in excess of $25 million to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject.

6. . In further consideration of the agreements of the Underwriters herein contained, the Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:
Covenants of the Company
(a) To furnish to you, without charge, a signed copy of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and documents incorporated by reference and to each Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto but including documents incorporated by reference) and to furnish to you in New York City without charge prior to 5:00 p.m. local time on the business day next succeeding the date of this Agreement, and during the period mentioned in paragraph (c) below, as many copies of the Prospectus, any documents incorporated therein by reference, and any supplements and amendments thereto or to the Registration Statement as you may reasonably request.
(b) Before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, to furnish to you a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement and not to file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object, and to file with the Commission within the applicable period specified in Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act any prospectus required to be filed pursuant to such Rule. The Company has given the Representatives notice of any filings made pursuant to the Exchange Act or rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder within 48 hours prior to the Applicable Time; the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to make any such filing from the Applicable Time to the Closing Date and will furnish the Representatives with copies of any such documents a reasonable amount of time prior to such proposed filing.
(c) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Securities may have been sold by you on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either such amendment to the Registration Statement or amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law. If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the
 
information contained in the Registration Statement (or any other registration statement relating to the Securities) or the Statutory Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or included or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that subsequent time, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Representatives and will promptly amend or supplement, at its own expense, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
(d) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request.
(e) To make generally available to the Company's security holders and to you as soon as practicable an earnings statement that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
(f) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the Closing Date, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company or warrants to purchase debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Securities (other than (i) the Securities or (ii) commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business), without the prior written consent of the Representatives.
(g) The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Securities, in a form approved by the Representatives and contained in Schedule II, and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").
(h) The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule III hereto. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus". The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the Securities Act applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 under the Securities Act or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated above.
 
(i) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and Company's accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus forming a part of the General Disclosure Package, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers in the quantities hereinabove specified, (ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Securities; (iii) the fees and disbursements of the Trustee and its counsel; (iv) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with any Blue Sky memorandum, (v) the printing and delivery to the Underwriters of copies of any Blue Sky memorandum; (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities; (vii) all other costs and expenses of the Company in connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section and (viii) any other costs and expenses of others in connection with the performance of the Company's obligations hereunder which have been previously approved by the Company. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, Section 7 entitled "Indemnity and Contribution", and the last paragraph of Section 9 below, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel, stock transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
7.
Indemnity and Contribution.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (including the Rule 430B Information), any preliminary prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Statutory Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7, such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without
 
the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 7 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the aggregate net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the aggregate underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 7. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages
pro
rata
 
that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
8. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by you to the Company, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, either of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) there has occurred a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services, (iv) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York or California shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State or California authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in the financial markets in the United States or in the international financial markets or any calamity or crisis, that, in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (v), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives impracticable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package.
Termination
9. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bear to the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased
provided
 
pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder; , that no such reimbursement shall be required with respect to a termination of this Agreement by the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 9.
provided, however
10. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the Public Offering Price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company or its affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party, (c) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement, (d) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship, and (e) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITARY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY, BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE DEPOSITARY OR ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY OR BY THE DEPOSITARY OR ANY SUCH NOMINEE TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF SUCH SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.
UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY (AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL INASMUCH AS THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
SAFEWAY INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received promises to pay to
 
 
on March 27, 2009, and to pay interest thereon quarterly in arrears on March 27, June 27, September 27, and December 27 (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), beginning June 27, 2006 until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, and (to the extent that the payment of such interest is permitted by law) to pay interest at the rate per annum borne by this Security on any overdue principal and on any overdue installment of interest until paid. If any Interest Payment Date falls on a date that is not a Business Day, interest will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day, unless that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, in which case the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. The interest so payable and punctually paid or duly provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture, be paid to the person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the regular record date for such interest, which shall be the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a Business Day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. However, interest payable on the Stated Maturity will be payable to the person to whom the principal will be payable. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such regular
record date and may either be paid to the person in whose name this Security (or one or more predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Company, notice whereof shall be given to the Trustee and the Holders not less than 10 days prior to such special record date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner. Interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the applicable period divided by 360.
Principal of and interest on the Securities will be payable in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. The transfer of the Securities will be registrable, the Securities may be presented for exchange, and notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of this Security and the Indenture may be served, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose (which initially will be The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. at 700 South Flower Street, Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90017, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration); provided that, unless all of the outstanding Securities are Global Securities, the Company will at all times maintain an office or agency for such purposes in Los Angeles; and provided, further, that, except as provided in the next sentence, payment of interest may, at the option of the Company, be made by check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto. If this Security is a Global Security, the interest payable on this Security will be paid to Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, or its registered assigns as the registered owner of this Security, by wire transfer of immediately available funds on each of the applicable Interest Payment Dates.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Security to be signed manually or by facsimile by its duly authorized officers.
Date: March 28, 2006
 
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized series of securities of the Company issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of September 10, 1997, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor in interest to The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, originally issued in $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount, subject to increase in accordance with the Indenture (herein called the "Securities"). All terms used but not defined in this Security shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
The terms of the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by the Officers' Certificate dated March 28, 2006 delivered pursuant thereto and the TIA. The Securities are subject to all such terms, and the Securityholders are referred to the Indenture and said Act for a statement of them.
 
The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund.
 
The Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Company on any Interest Payment Date that is on or after September 27, 2006, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed. The Company will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption.
If notice of redemption has been given as described below and funds for the redemption of any Securities called for redemption have been made available on the redemption dates specified in the notice, the Securities will cease to bear interest on the date fixed for the redemption specified in the notice and the only right of the holders of the Securities from and after the redemption date will be to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender of the Securities in accordance with the notice.
Notice of any optional redemption of any Securities will be mailed at least 15 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. The notice of redemption for the Securities will state, among other things, the amount of Securities to be redeemed, the redemption date, the redemption price and the place or places that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of Securities to be redeemed. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on any Securities that have been called for redemption at the redemption date.
 
Interest on this Security will accrue from, and including, March 28, 2006, to, and excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and then from, and including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment
Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for to, but excluding, the next Interest Payment Date or the Stated Maturity, as the case may be (each, an "Interest Period"). The amount of accrued interest for any Interest Period shall be calculated by multiplying the face amount of this Security by an accrued interest factor. This accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from March 28, 2006, or from the last date the Company paid interest, to the date for which accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each day shall be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to that day by 360.
If the Stated Maturity of this Security falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Company shall pay principal and interest on the next succeeding Business Day, but will deem that payment was made on the date that the payment was due. No interest will accrue for the period beginning on the Stated Maturity to the payment date on such next Business Day.
The interest rate on this Security will be reset quarterly, will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be equal to LIBOR plus 0.35%, except that the interest rate will not exceed the rate permitted by applicable law. The Interest Determination Date for an Interest Period will be the second London business day preceding the first day of such Interest Period. Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee of the interest rate for the next Interest Period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holder hereof.
"Business Day" means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in the City of New York on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close; provided that the day is also a "London business day."
"London business day" means any day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
"LIBOR" will be determined by the Calculation Agent in accordance with the following provisions:
(i) With respect to any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in United States dollars having a maturity of three months commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period that appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date. If no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, the Calculation Agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P.'s page BBAM. If no rate is obtained from Bloomberg L.P.'s page BBAM, then LIBOR, in respect to that Interest Determination Date, will be determined in accordance with the provisions described in (ii) below.
(ii) With respect to an Interest Determination Date on which no rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750, or is obtained from Bloomberg L.P.'s page BBAM, as specified in (i) above, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in United States dollars for the period of three months, commencing on the first day of the applicable Interest Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, then LIBOR on the Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., in The City of New York, on the Interest Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in United States dollars to leading European banks, having a three-month maturity and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in United States dollars in that market at that time; provided, however, that if the banks selected by the Calculation Agent are not providing quotations in the manner described by this sentence, LIBOR determined as of that Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on that Interest Determination Date.
"Moneyline Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page 3750" on Moneyline Telerate, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying the London interbank rates of major banks for United States dollars.
"Calculation Agency Agreement" means the Calculation Agency Agreement dated as of March 28, 2006 by and between The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., and the Company, as such agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time.
"Calculation Agent" means The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A, or such other Person as the Company shall from time to time designate in accordance with the Calculation Agency Agreement.
 
This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of U.S. $2,000 and integral multiples of $1000 in excess thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein and herein set forth, the transfer, or the exchange for an equal principal amount, of this Security is registrable with the Registrar upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Registrar.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may, subject to certain exceptions, require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder in whose name this Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money held by them for the payment of principal and interest that remains unclaimed for two years. After that, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Securities or (ii) certain covenants and Events of Default with respect to the Securities, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth therein.
 
Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Indenture permits the Company and the Trustee to enter into a supplemental indenture with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities), for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Securityholders. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Trustee (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities) may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of the Indenture or the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the Company's and its Subsidiaries' ability to create or incur certain Liens on any of their respective properties or assets and to enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and on the Company's ability to engage in mergers or consolidations or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its properties and assets. These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and reference is made to the Indenture for a description thereof.
 
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities may be declared (or, in certain cases, shall become) due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
ipso facto
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy under the Indenture, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities and unless also the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceedings as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities at the time outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute such proceeding, within 60 days. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of the principal hereof or any interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
 
The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
 
A past, present or future director, officer, employee, shareholder or incorporator, as such, of the Company or any successor corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Security or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration of issuance of the Securities.
 
The internal laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and the Securities.
The following abbreviations, when used in the inscription on the face of this Security, shall be construed as though they were written out in full according to applicable laws or regulations:
