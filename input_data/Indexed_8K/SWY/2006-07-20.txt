Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On July 20, 2006, we issued our earnings press release for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2006 and 2005 are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  also are provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
 
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO (income) expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
"Free cash flow," "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in fiscal 2006 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on Safeway's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "free cash flow," "Adjusted EBITDA" and "Adjusted Debt" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $246.2 million ($0.55 per diluted share) for the second quarter ended June 17, 2006. This includes a $58.5 million ($0.13 per diluted share) reduction in income tax expense for interest earned on a previously announced federal income tax refund. Net income for the second quarter of 2005 was $134.0 million ($0.30 per diluted share).
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales increased 6.4% to $9.4 billion in the second quarter of 2006 from $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Identical-stores sales increased 5.6% for the second quarter of 2006. Excluding fuel sales, identical-store sales increased 4.2%. Safeway estimates that the shift in Easter holiday sales (which occurred in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005) increased identical-store sales by approximately 1.0% in the second quarter of 2006.
"These improved results were driven by strong sales growth, a healthy expansion in non-fuel gross margin, and significant operating and administrative expense leverage," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "We believe we are well positioned to deliver improved results for the year, and therefore are raising our earnings guidance for 2006."
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased to $2.7 billion in the second quarter of 2006 from $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2005. Gross profit margin decreased 8 basis points to 28.66% of sales in the second quarter of 2006 compared to 28.74% in the second quarter of 2005. Excluding the 50 basis-point decrease attributable to higher fuel sales (which have a
lower gross margin), gross profit margin increased 42 basis points due largely to reduced shrink as well as procurement cost savings, partly offset by selected price investments.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense improved 72 basis points to 24.58% of sales in the second quarter of 2006 from 25.30% in the second quarter of 2005. This improvement is primarily due to increased sales and lower employee costs as a percentage of sales.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $91.6 million in the second quarter of 2006, down from $94.5 million in the second quarter of 2005. Indebtedness was lower in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005, while average interest rates were higher.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $50.9 million, or 17.1% of pretax income, in the second quarter of 2006 compared to 38.1% in the second quarter of 2005. Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2006 was reduced by $58.5 million of accrued interest, net of income tax, on the federal income tax refund described below.
As previously announced, Safeway settled a federal income tax refund claim under which it expects to receive approximately $318 million in the third quarter of 2006. This refund consists of a tax refund of $259.2 million and interest earned on that refund of $58.5 million. The federal income tax refund of $259.2 million has been recorded in the second quarter of 2006 as an increase to additional paid-in capital.
24-Week Results
Net income for the first 24 weeks of 2006 was $389.1 million ($0.86 per diluted share) compared to $265.3 million ($0.59 per diluted share) in the first 24 weeks of 2005. The gross profit margin was 28.87% in 2006 compared to 28.98% in 2005. Operating and administrative expense was 25.04% of sales in 2006 compared to 25.55% of sales in 2005.
Stock Repurchase
During the quarter, Safeway purchased 5.84 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $23.88 per share, and a total cost of $139.7 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases is approximately $425 million.
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested $741.3 million in capital expenditures in the first 24 weeks of 2006. The company opened 5 new Lifestyle stores and completed 80 Lifestyle remodels in the first half of 2006. For the year, the company expects to spend approximately $1.6 billion in capital expenditures, open approximately 20 new Lifestyle stores, and complete approximately 280 Lifestyle remodels.
 
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities was $742.5 million in the first 24 weeks of 2006 compared to $671.8 million in the first 24 weeks of 2005. This change was primarily because of higher net income.
Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, was $725.8 million for the first 24 weeks of 2006 compared to $484.7 million in 2005. The company had higher purchases of land and buildings in the first quarter of 2006. In addition, a portion of the costs associated with the large number of Lifestyle projects completed late in the fourth quarter of 2005 were paid for in the first quarter of 2006.
Financing activities used cash flow of $274.6 million in the first 24 weeks of 2006 compared to $131.9 million in the first 24 weeks of 2005. This change was primarily because of the stock repurchase of $139.7 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Guidance
Safeway is increasing earnings guidance for 2006 to a range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share (excluding the $0.13 per diluted share impact of the favorable tax settlement) from $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share. The company now expects that compared to 2005, its 2006 non-fuel gross profit margin will be flat to improving by 10 basis points and that non-fuel operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales will improve by 30 to 40 basis points. The company is also reconfirming free cash flow guidance in the range of $400 million to $600 million. The earnings and cash flow guidance includes any employee buyouts but excludes the impact of the favorable tax settlement. The company continues to expect non-fuel identical-store sales to grow approximately 3% for the year.
