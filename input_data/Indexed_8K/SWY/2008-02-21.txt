The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc. (the "Company"), whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On February 21, 2008, we issued our earnings press release for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2007. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of adjusted earnings per share to GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2006 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, and reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for fiscal 2006 and 2007 and to the forecasted range for fiscal 2008 are also provided in the press release. Given the rapid growth in the third-party gift card business and the highly seasonal nature of that business, with a significant portion of sales of third-party gift cards occurring in late December each year, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate for payables related to third-party gift cards for 2008, and therefore is not able to provide a reconciliation of 2008 free cash flow to net cash flow from operating activities. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
The exclusions included in "adjusted earnings per share" relate to various tax benefits. Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such benefits are incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the tax benefits that we have experienced. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "adjusted earnings per share" as an indicator of our ongoing operating performance.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the enumerated non-cash items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
 
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
"Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt," "free cash flow" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that the Company generates in fiscal 2008 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and "free cash flow" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $301.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $307.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share was $0.68 in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of 2006. However, diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2006 was increased by $0.08 due to various favorable tax items.
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales increased 6.8% to $13.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Contributions from Lifestyle stores, increased fuel sales and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate drove this increase. Identical-store sales increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding fuel, identical-store sales increased 2.7%.
"We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter of 2007," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President, and CEO. "Excluding the $0.08 tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2006, our diluted earnings per share increased by 11.5%."
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 44 basis points to 28.69% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 29.13% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2006. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 50 basis points. The remaining 6 basis- point increase is the result of improved shrink, lower advertising expense and higher revenue from Blackhawk Network, partly offset by investments in price and higher LIFO expense. LIFO expense was $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to LIFO income of $5.8 million in 2006.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense improved 55 basis points to 24.21% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 from 24.76% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2006. Higher fuel sales in 2007 reduced operating and administrative expense by 36 basis points. The remaining 19 basis point decline was the result of larger gains on disposal of property and reduced employee costs, partly offset by higher depreciation.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $120.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $121.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Indebtedness was lower in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006, while average interest rates were slightly higher.
Other Income
Other income declined to $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 from $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 due primarily to the resolution of various tax items at Casa Ley, Safeway's unconsolidated affiliate in Mexico.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $179.2 million, or 37.3% of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2007. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $127.2 million, or 29.2% of pre-tax income. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2006 included approximately $38.0 million of tax benefits ($0.08 per diluted share) due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and various other favorable items.
Annual Results
Net income for the year 2007 was $888.4 million ($1.99 per diluted share) compared to $870.6 million ($1.94 per diluted share) in 2006. Results in 2006 were increased by income tax benefits of $96.5 million ($0.22 per diluted share) related to interest on federal and state income tax refunds and various other favorable tax items. Sales increased 5.2% to $42.3 billion in 2007 from $40.2 billion in 2006 primarily because of Safeway's marketing strategy, Lifestyle store execution, increased fuel sales and an increase in the Canadian dollar exchange rate. Identical-store sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.4%.
Gross profit decreased 8 basis points to 28.74% of sales in 2007 from 28.82% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales reduced gross profit by 20 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross profit increased 12 basis points primarily because of lower advertising expense, improved shrink, and benefits from supply-chain initiatives, partly offset by investments in price and higher LIFO expense. LIFO expense was $13.9 million in 2007 compared to $1.2 million in 2006.
Operating and administrative expense decreased 29 basis points to 24.55% of sales in 2007 from 24.84% of sales in 2006. Higher fuel sales in 2007 reduced operating and administrative expense by 16 basis points. The remaining 13 basis point decline is primarily the result of reduced employee costs as a percentage of sales and higher gains on disposal of property, partly offset by higher depreciation expense.
 
Stock Repurchase
During the fourth quarter of 2007, Safeway purchased 3.0 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $31.62 per share and a total cost of $93.6 million (including commissions). For the year, Safeway purchased 6.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $33.57 per share and a total cost of $226.1 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases as of year-end 2007 is $521.1 million.

In 2008 the company expects to spend $1.70 to $1.75 billion in capital expenditures, open 20 to 25 new Lifestyle stores and complete 250 to 255 Lifestyle remodels.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,190.5 million in 2007 compared to $2,175.0 million in 2006.
Net cash flow used by investing activities declined slightly to $1,686.4 million in 2007 from $1,734.7 million in 2006. Cash paid for property additions was greater in 2007 than in 2006. However, proceeds from the sale of property were also greater in 2007. In addition Safeway spent $83.8 million to acquire businesses in 2006.
Net cash flow used by financing activities was $454.0 million in 2007 compared to $596.3 million in 2006. In 2007 Safeway paid down $261.3 million of debt, repurchased $226.1 million of common stock, and paid $111.5 million of dividends. In 2006 Safeway paid down $493.1 million of debt, repurchased $318.0 million of common stock, paid $96.0 million in dividends and received $262.3 million in income tax refunds.
Guidance
Safeway confirmed guidance for the 53-week year 2008 of $2.25 to $2.35 diluted earnings per share and free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million. Identical-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 3.0% to 3.2%.
