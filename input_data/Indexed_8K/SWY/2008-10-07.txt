The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On October 7, 2008, we issued our earnings press release for the third quarter of fiscal 2008. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 6, 2008 and September 8, 2007 and to the forecasted range for fiscal 2008 are also provided in the press release. Given the rapid growth in the third-party gift card business and the highly seasonal nature of that business, with a significant portion of sales of third-party gift cards occurring in late December each year, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate for payables related to third-party gift cards for 2008, and therefore is not able to provide a reconciliation of 2008 free cash flow to net cash flow from operating activities. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
"Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt," "free cash flow" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that we generate in fiscal 2008 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods indicated as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and "free cash flow" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
 
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $199.7 million ($0.46 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $194.6 million ($0.44 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2007.
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales increased 3.9% to $10.2 billion in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $9.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. This increase was driven by higher fuel sales and contributions from Lifestyle stores. Identical-store sales increased 2.8% including fuel and 0.5% excluding fuel.
"During the third quarter we took action to provide our customers with better everyday values," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "As we begin the fourth quarter, our sales momentum is building, with identical-store sales (excluding fuel) currently above 1.5%, and we are continuing to reduce costs. We continue to believe our diluted earnings per share for 2008 will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 for this 53-week year."
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 102 basis points to 27.49% of sales in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 28.51% of sales in the third quarter of 2007. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit margin by 55 basis points. The remaining 47 basis point decline was the result of investments in price, higher LIFO expense and higher energy costs, partly offset by improved shrink and lower advertising expense.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense improved 82 basis points to 23.69% of sales in the third quarter of 2008 from 24.51% of sales in the third quarter of 2007. Higher fuel sales in 2008 reduced operating and administrative expense margin by 49 basis points. The remaining 33 basis point improvement was the result of reduced employee costs, partly offset by higher energy and occupancy costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense declined to $80.0 million in the third quarter of 2008 from $89.2 million in the third quarter of 2007 due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower average borrowings.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense was $112.3 million, or 36.0% of pre-tax income, in the third quarter of 2008. Income tax expense in the third quarter of 2007 was $112.4 million, or 36.6% of pre-tax income.
36-Week Results
Net income for the first 36 weeks of 2008 was $627.4 million ($1.43 per diluted share) compared to $587.2 million ($1.32 per diluted share) in the first 36 weeks of 2007.
The gross profit margin declined 57 basis points to 28.19% in the first 36 weeks of 2008 from 28.76% for the first 36 weeks of 2007. Excluding the 46 basis point reduction in gross profit margin due to higher fuel sales, gross profit margin declined 11 basis points. Operating and administrative expense margin improved 60 basis points to 24.10% in the first 36 weeks of 2008 from 24.70% in the first 36 weeks of 2007. Excluding the 34 basis point reduction due to higher fuel sales, operating and administrative expense margin improved by 26 basis points.
Stock Repurchases
During the third quarter of 2008, Safeway purchased 6.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $26.77 per share and a total cost of $184.9 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases at quarter-end was $1.2 billion.
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested $1,007.3 million in capital expenditures in the first 36 weeks of 2008. The company opened eight new Lifestyle stores, completed 119 Lifestyle remodels and closed 13 stores. For the year, the company now expects to spend $1.65 billion to $1.70 billion in capital expenditures, open approximately 20 new Lifestyle stores and complete approximately 240 Lifestyle remodels.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities was $1,284.8 million in the first 36 weeks of 2008 compared to $1,248.0 million in the first 36 weeks of 2007.
 
Net cash flow used by investing activities was $980.1 million in the first 36 weeks of 2008 compared to $1,183.2 million in the first 36 weeks of 2007.
Net cash flow used by financing activities was $209.4 million in the first 36 weeks of 2008 compared to $90.3 million in the first 36 weeks of 2007.
Free cash flow increased to $499.3 million in the first 36 weeks of 2008 compared to $206.0 million in the first 36 weeks of 2007.
Guidance
Safeway confirmed guidance for 2008 (a 53-week year) of $2.25 to $2.35 diluted earnings per share, free cash flow of $500 million to $700 million and identical-store sales growth, excluding fuel, of 1.0% to 2.0%.
