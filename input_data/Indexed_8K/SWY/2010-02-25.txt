The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On February 25, 2010, we issued our earnings press release for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2009. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. A reconciliation of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for fiscal 2009 and 2008 is also provided in the press release. Reconciliations of net income excluding goodwill impairment charge to GAAP net loss and diluted earnings per share excluding goodwill impairment charge to diluted loss per share for fiscal 2009 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 are also provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, impairment charges, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
"Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt," "free cash flow" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities.
 
The exclusion included in "net income, excluding goodwill impairment charge" and "diluted earnings per share, excluding goodwill impairment charge" relate to the effects of the non-cash goodwill impairment charge that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Management believes that excluding this item provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such charge was incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the goodwill impairment charge that we have experienced. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our "net income excluding goodwill impairment charge" and "diluted earnings per share, excluding goodwill impairment charge" as indicators of our ongoing operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and "free cash flow" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported a net loss of $1,609.1 million ($4.06 per diluted share) for the 16-week fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,818.2 million, net of tax ($4.59 per diluted share), net income would have been $209.1 million ($0.53 per diluted share). Net income was $338.0 million ($0.79 per diluted share) for the 17-week fourth quarter of 2008.
"Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, our results were in line with our expectations," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "Despite very challenging economic conditions, Safeway generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion in 2009. This exceeded our expectations and is the highest annual free cash flow ever achieved by Safeway."
In the fourth quarter of 2009, Safeway recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,974.2 million ($1,818.2 million, net of tax). The impairment was due primarily to Safeway's reduced market capitalization and a weak economy. The divisions affected were primarily Vons and Eastern. The goodwill originated from previous acquisitions.
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales declined 8.1% to $12.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $13.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. This decline was the result of an additional week in 2008 and a 4.1% decline in identical-store sales, excluding fuel, for the quarter.
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 14 basis points to 28.64% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 28.78% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the two basis point impact from fuel sales, gross profit declined 16 basis points. This decline was largely the result of investments in everyday price and increased advertising, partly offset by lower LIFO expense and increased gift card sales.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense increased 92 basis points to 25.26% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 24.34% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the two basis point impact of lower fuel sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, operating and administrative expense margin increased 90 basis points. This increase was primarily the result of decreased sales leverage, increased charges from property impairments, lower gains from the sale of property and increased pension expense, partly offset by lower workers' compensation expense and lower utility expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense declined to $98.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $112.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates.
Income Taxes
As a result of the goodwill impairment charge, the company recognized an income tax benefit of $33.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding the impairment charge, income tax expense was 36.9% of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 32.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The income tax rate in 2008 was lower due to a reduction in a reserve on charitable contribution carryforwards and the favorable resolution of other tax items.
Annual Results
Net loss for the 52-week year 2009 was $1,097.5 million ($2.66 per diluted share). Excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $1,818.2 million, net of tax ($4.40 per diluted share), net income would have been $720.7 million ($1.74 per diluted share). This compares to net income of $965.3 million ($2.21 per diluted share) in the 53-week year 2008.
The gross profit margin was 28.62% in 2009 compared to 28.38% in 2008. Operating and administrative expense margin was 25.33% in 2009 compared to 24.17% in 2008.
Stock Repurchases
During the fourth quarter of 2009, Safeway purchased 19.4 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $22.82 per share and a total cost of $443.1 million (including commissions). For the full year, Safeway purchased 42.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $20.80 per share and a total cost of $884.9 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases at year-end was approximately $1.3 billion.
 
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested $248.8 million in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2009. The company opened one new Lifestyle store, completed 20 Lifestyle remodels and closed six stores. For the year, Safeway invested $851.6 million in capital expenditures, opened eight new Lifestyle stores, completed 82 Lifestyle remodels and closed 22 stores. At year-end 2009, 79% of our stores were Lifestyle stores.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $2,549.7 million in the year 2009 compared to $2,250.9 million in the year 2008. Certain tax items increased cash flow from operating activities in 2009 by approximately $396 million.
Net cash flow used by investing activities declined to $889.0 million in the year 2009 from $1,546.0 million in 2008 because of reduced capital expenditures, partly offset by lower proceeds from the sales of property.
Net cash flow used by financing activities increased to $1,600.3 million in the year 2009 from $594.3 million in 2008 due primarily to a net reduction in borrowings and increased stock repurchases.
