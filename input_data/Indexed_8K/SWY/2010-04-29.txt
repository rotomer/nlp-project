The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On April 29, 2010, we issued our earnings press release for the first quarter of fiscal 2010. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of net cash flow used by operating activities, as adjusted, to GAAP cash flow for the 12 weeks ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 are also provided in the press release, as are reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for the 12 weeks ended March 27, 2010 and March 28, 2009 and to the forecasted range for fiscal 2010. Given the rapid growth in the third-party gift card business and the highly seasonal nature of that business, with a significant portion of sales of third-party gift cards occurring in late December each year, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate for payables related to third-party gift cards for 2010, and therefore is not able to provide a reconciliation of 2010 free cash flow to net cash flow from operating activities. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "net cash flow from operating activities, as adjusted" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures and different business ventures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, impairment charges, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance. Excluding the effect of third-party gift card sales from net cash flow from operating activities facilitates a comparison of our company to other companies that don't have a gift card business or other business venture that is highly seasonal.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
 
"Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" "free cash flow" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt and fund share repurchases that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that we generate in fiscal 2010 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt," "free cash flow" and "net cash flow from operating activities, as adjusted" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Pleasanton, CA  April 29, 2010
Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $96.0 million ($0.25 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $144.2 million ($0.34 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2009.
"Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance for 2010 of $1.65 to $1.85," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "We are encouraged by our volume trends in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, and the trends have improved in the second quarter of 2010. We believe we will continue to see positive trends in the second half of the year as the economy improves, deflation subsides and consumer confidence builds."
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales increased to $9.3 billion in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $9.2 billion in the first quarter of 2009. This increase was the result of a higher Canadian exchange rate and higher fuel sales, partly offset by a 3.1% decline in identical-store sales, excluding fuel.
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 31 basis points to 28.41% of sales in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 28.72% of sales in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the 26 basis point impact from fuel sales, gross profit declined five basis points. This decline was largely the result of increased advertising, partly offset by changes in product mix and improved shrink.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense increased 44 basis points to 26.11% of sales in the first quarter of 2010 from 25.67% of sales in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the 39 basis point impact of higher fuel sales in the first quarter of 2010, operating and administrative expense margin increased 83 basis points. This increase was largely the result of both deflation and volume declines. The largest cost increases came from wages, benefits and property retirement and impairment charges.
Interest Expense
Interest expense declined to $69.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was 35.3% of pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 29.5% in the first quarter of 2009. The income tax rate in 2009 was lower due to the favorable resolution of tax matters.
Guidance
Safeway is reaffirming guidance for the year of $1.65 to $1.85 earnings per diluted share, non-fuel ID sales growth of 0% to 1%, operating profit margin change of negative 10 to positive five basis points, cash capital expenditures of approximately $0.9 to $1.0 billion and free cash flow of $0.9 to $1.1 billion.
Stock Repurchases
During the first quarter of 2010, Safeway purchased 4.0 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $24.78 per share and a total cost of $99.2 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases at quarter-end was approximately $1.2 billion.
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested $192.6 million in capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2010. The company completed nine Lifestyle remodels and closed 13 stores. For the year, Safeway plans to invest $0.9 to $1.0 billion in capital expenditures, open 20 new Lifestyle stores and complete 80 Lifestyle remodels.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow used by operating activities was $242.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $151.0 million in the first quarter of 2009. This was primarily due to a greater decline in third-party gift card payables, net of receivables, in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Cash from the sale of third-party gift cards is held for a short period of time and then remitted, less Safeway's commissions, to card partners. Excluding the effect of these third-party gift cards, cash flow from operating activities improved to $134.3 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $66.1 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Net cash flow used by investing activities declined to $192.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $252.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 because of reduced capital expenditures.
Net cash flow provided by financing activities increased to $416.3 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $131.0 million in the first quarter of 2009 due primarily to a net increase in borrowings.
