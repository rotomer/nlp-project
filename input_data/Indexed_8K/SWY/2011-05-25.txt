Conformity to Securities Laws

Holder understands that Holder will recognize ordinary income for federal income tax purposes under Section 83 of the Code as the restrictions applicable to the Unreleased Shares lapse. In this context, "restriction" includes the Forfeiture Restriction. Holder understands that Holder may elect to be taxed for federal income tax purposes at the time the Shares are issued rather than as and when the Forfeiture Restriction lapses by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service no later than 30 days following the date of grant. Information regarding an election under Section 83(b) of the Code is attached to the Grant Notice as .

(i) by cash or check made payable to the Company;
(ii) by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Holder;
(iii) by tendering Shares which are not subject to the Forfeiture Restriction and which have a then current Fair Market Value not greater than the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's withholding obligation based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income tax and payroll tax purposes; or
(iv) in any combination of the foregoing.
(b) In the event Holder fails to provide timely payment of all sums required by the Company pursuant to Section 5.12(a), the Company shall have the right and option, but not obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Holder to provide all or any portion of such required payment by means of tendering Shares in accordance with Section 5.12(a)(iii).
5.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, if Holder is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Plan, the Shares and this Agreement shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by applicable
Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons
 
law, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.
5.14 . The Plan, the Grant Notice (including all Exhibits thereto) and this Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and Holder with respect to the subject matter hereof, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Company or a Subsidiary and Holder
