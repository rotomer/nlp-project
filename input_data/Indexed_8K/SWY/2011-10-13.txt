The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On October 13, 2011, we issued our earnings press release for the third quarter of fiscal 2011. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of "free cash flow" to GAAP cash flow for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 10, 2011 and September 11, 2010 and to the forecasted range for fiscal 2011 are also provided in the press release. Given the rapid growth in the third-party gift card business and the highly seasonal nature of that business, with a significant portion of sales of third-party gift cards occurring in late December each year, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate for payables related to third-party gift cards for 2011, and therefore is not able to provide a reconciliation of the forecasted range of free cash flow for fiscal 2011 to net cash flow from operating activities. Reconciliations of gross profit and operating and administrative expense basis point change, excluding impact from fuels sales and gross presentation of gift card commissions, are also provided in the press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that "Adjusted EBITDA" and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, property impairment charges, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate "Adjusted EBITDA" as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
 
"Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt," "free cash flow" and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt, fund share repurchases and pay dividends that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that we generate in fiscal 2011 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
Management believes that "basis point change in gross profit and operating and administrative expense, excluding impact from fuel sales and gross presentation of gift card commissions" provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the business ventures that we have.
Management also believes that excluding fuel sales from gross profit and operating and administrative expense provides more useful measures because volatility in fuel prices and the resulting fluctuations in our sales and cost of sales may distort investors', analysts' and other interested parties' perception of our operating performance. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view basis point change in gross profit and operating and administrative expense, excluding impact from fuel sales and gross presentation of gift card commissions as indicators of our ongoing operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate "Adjusted EBITDA," "Adjusted Debt" and "free cash flow" differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because of these and other limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these and other limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $130.2 million ($0.38 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2011 compared to $122.8 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the third quarter of 2010.
"Our sales momentum continued to build in the third quarter, and our costs were well controlled," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "At the same time, we continued to innovate throughout the business to meet our customers' needs and build their loyalty. Our just for U digital marketing platform and our proprietary Open Nature line of 100% natural foods are good examples of these efforts."
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales were $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $9.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010, due primarily to higher fuel sales, a 1.5% increase in identical-store sales (excluding fuel), a higher Canadian exchange rate and the impact of reporting Blackhawk commissions on a gross basis.
1
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined 114 basis points to 27.00% of sales in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 28.14% of sales in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the 88 basis-point impact from fuel sales and the 26 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, gross profit margin was flat.
 
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased 103 basis points to 24.53% in the third quarter of 2011 from 25.56% in the third quarter of 2010. Excluding the 71 basis-point impact of higher fuel sales and the 24 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, operating and administrative expense margin decreased eight basis points.
Interest Expense
Interest expense declined to $60.7 million in the third quarter of 2011 from $69.4 million in the third quarter of 2010 due to lower average interest rates and lower average borrowings.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was 33.6% of pre-tax income in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 31.0% in the third quarter of 2010. Income tax expense was lower in 2010 due to the resolution of a number of individually small items.
36-Week Results
Net income for the first 36 weeks of 2011 declined to $301.1 million ($0.85 per diluted share) compared to $360.1 million ($0.94 per diluted share) in the first 36 weeks of 2010 primarily due to the net negative impact from the Canadian dividend paid in the first half of 2011. The gross profit margin was 27.17% in the first 36 weeks of 2011 compared to 28.36% in the first 36 weeks of 2010. Operating and administrative expense margin was 24.70% in the first 36 weeks of 2011 compared to 25.74% in the first 36 weeks of 2010.
Guidance
Safeway is reaffirming earnings per diluted share and free cash flow guidance for the year. Identical-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to be approximately 1.0% for the year.
Stock Repurchases
During the third quarter of 2011, Safeway purchased 10.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $19.30 per share and a total cost of $195.2 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases at quarter-end was approximately $0.9 billion.
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested $288.4 million in capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2011. The company completed five new stores and seven Lifestyle remodels, and closed 11 stores. For the year, Safeway plans to invest approximately $1.0 billion in capital expenditures, while completing 26 new Lifestyle stores and 30 Lifestyle remodels.
 
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by operating activities declined to $710.9 million in the first 36 weeks of 2011 compared to $846.6 million in the first 36 weeks of 2010 due primarily to contributions to pension plans and an increase in inventory, net of payables.
Net cash flow used by investing activities increased to $744.4 million in the first 36 weeks of 2011 compared to $550.6 million in the first 36 weeks of 2010 due primarily to increased cash capital expenditures.
Net cash flow used by financing activities increased to $583.2 million in the first 36 weeks of 2011 from $139.6 million in the first 36 weeks of 2010 due primarily to lower net long-term borrowings and increased purchases of treasury stock in 2011.
