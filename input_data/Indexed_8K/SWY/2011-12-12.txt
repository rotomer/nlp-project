Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 6, 2011, the Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Safeway Inc. adopted a design change to our long-term incentive program ("LTIP") pursuant to our 2011 Equity and Incentive Award Plan (the "2011 Plan") and 2007 Equity and Incentive Award Plan (the "2007 Plan").
Based on extensive stockholder engagement in connection with the compensation-related advisory votes contained in our annual Proxy Statement filed on April 1, 2011 and input from the Committee's compensation consultant and management, the Committee has adopted a new type of LTIP equity award with a value linked to our financial performance. The purpose of the design change is to help advance the goals of our Compensation Objectives and Philosophy, as described in our annual Proxy Statement filed on April 1, 2011.
For the 2011 fiscal year, our executive officers received a mix of stock options and restricted stock. These awards vest at the rate of 20% per year over five years. For the 2011 fiscal year, each executive officer was allowed to choose a mix of stock options and restricted stock in increments of 25%, based on an exchange ratio of 3.5 stock options for one share of restricted stock. Each executive's award could be 25% restricted stock, or 50%, 75%, 100% or 0%.
For the 2012 fiscal year, the Committee has determined to grant a new type of equity award to our executive officers under the LTIP instead of time-vested restricted stock awards. Our executive officers will be granted a mix of stock options (50% by number, not by value) and performance share awards (50% by number, assuming target level performance). The options will vest at the rate of 25% per year over four years. The performance share awards will vest upon our achievement of specified business performance criteria (currently anticipated to be earnings per share goals determined on a compounded annual growth basis), at which time the executive will receive the specified number of shares of our common stock. The performance share awards specify a minimum performance level that must be achieved in order for the executive to receive any shares and a target number of shares that will be received upon achievement of target levels. If our performance exceeds the target performance goals, the executive may receive additional shares above the target number, subject to a specified maximum contained in the award. The award agreements provide for double-trigger acceleration of vesting upon a change in control. The forms of award agreements for performance share awards under the 2011 Plan and 2007 Plan are attached as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Among the potential recipients are the following five individuals, each of whom were named executive officers pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K for purposes of our annual Proxy Statement filed on April 1, 2011:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our Proxy Statement, Annual Report to Stockholders and reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K and other publicly available information should be consulted for other important information about our compensation plans and policies.

(b) If the Administrator determines that the Performance Shares have been assumed and, before the Payment Date, Participant experiences a Termination of Services, other than for Cause, or Participant experiences a Termination of Services with Good Reason, within the one year period immediately following the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable upon such Termination of Services and the number of Shares earned and issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall equal the greater of (a) the target number of Performance Shares set forth in the Grant Notice, and (b) the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned based on actual achievement of the Company's Performance Goals through the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control (calculated as if the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control had been the end of the Performance Period).

2.4 . In consideration of the grant of the award of Performance Shares by the Company, Participant agrees to render faithful and efficient services to the Company or any Subsidiary.

Consideration to the Company; No Employment Rights
2.5 . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, upon Participant's Termination of Services for any or no reason, all rights with respect to any unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Participant, or Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be, will be entitled to no payments or benefits with respect thereto, unless the Administrator, as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Plan, determines in its sole discretion otherwise (in which case any payment to be made pursuant to this Award Agreement will be made on the Payment Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, within the period required by Section 409A of the Code, such that it qualifies as a "short-term deferral" pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Department of Treasury regulations); , that in the event of Participant's Termination of Services during the Performance Period by reason of death, disability or Retirement, Participant shall be entitled to receive, on the Payment Date, a portion of the unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement that would have been paid had Participant remained employed to the end of the Performance Period, prorated according to the number of months that Participant was employed during the Performance Period.

(i) by cash or check made payable to the Company;
(ii) by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant;
(iii) by tendering Shares (including, without limitation, Shares otherwise payable pursuant to the Performance Shares) which have a then-current Fair Market Value on the date of delivery not greater than the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's withholding obligation based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income tax and payroll tax purposes;
(iv) by surrendering other property acceptable to the Administrator (including, without limitation, through the delivery of a notice that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares payable pursuant to the Performance Shares, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of its withholding obligations; that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale); or

(v) in any combination of the foregoing.
 
(b) In the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required by the Company pursuant to Section 2.6(a), the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to provide all or any portion of such required payment by means of tendering Shares in accordance with Section 2.6(a)(iii).
(c) The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any new certificate representing Shares to Participant or Participant's legal representative or enter such Shares in book entry form unless and until Participant or Participant's legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state and local taxes applicable to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the grant of the Performance Shares or the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Performance Shares.
