Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On February 23, 2012, we issued our earnings press release for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year 2011. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures  net income and net cash flow from operating activities  are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of free cash flow to GAAP cash flow for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are also provided in the press release. Reconciliations of gross profit and operating and administrative expense basis point decrease, excluding impact from fuels sales, gross presentation of gift card commissions and LIFO expense, to GAAP gross profit and operating and administrative expense are also provided in the press release, as is a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share, excluding the tax charge on the Canadian dividend, to GAAP diluted earnings per share. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate managements evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, impairment charges, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in managements experience, whether a store is new or one that is fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate Adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt, free cash flow and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeways ability to service debt, fund share repurchases and pay dividends that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities.
Management believes that basis point decrease in gross profit and operating and administrative expense, excluding impact from fuel sales, gross presentation of gift card commissions and LIFO expense provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the business ventures that we have and that might have different methodologies for calculating LIFO expense.
Management also believes that excluding fuel sales from gross profit and operating and administrative expense provides more useful measures because volatility in fuel prices and the resulting fluctuations in our sales and cost of sales may distort investors', analysts' and other interested parties' perception of our operating performance. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view basis point decrease in gross profit and operating and administrative expense, excluding impact from fuel sales and gross presentation of gift card commissions as indicators of our ongoing operating performance.
The exclusion from diluted earnings per share relates to the tax charge on the dividend paid to us by our Canadian subsidiary during 2011. Management believes that excluding this item provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such charge was incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the organizational structure that we have. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, as an indicator of our ongoing operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt and free cash flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
Because of these and other limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these and other limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported net income of $
215.6 million
($
0.67
per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of
2011
. In the fourth quarter of
2010
, Safeway reported net income of $
229.6 million
($
0.62
per diluted share).
"Our business continued to grow," said Steve Burd, Chairman, President and CEO. "With ID sales growth remaining steady and costs well-controlled, we increased earnings per share 8%. As we move into 2012, our personalized marketing efforts and innovation in private label brands should contribute to our growth."
Sales and Other Revenue
Total sales increased 6.2% to
$13.6 billion
in the fourth quarter of
2011
from
$12.8 billion
in the fourth quarter of
2010
due primarily to higher fuel sales, the impact of reporting Blackhawk commissions on a gross basis
1
and a
1.5%
increase in identical-store sales (excluding fuel).
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined
137
basis points to
26.71%
of sales in the fourth quarter of
2011
compared to
28.08%
of sales in the fourth quarter of
2010
. Excluding the 48 basis-point impact from fuel sales and the 48 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, gross profit declined 41 basis points due primarily to increased LIFO expense.
 
_____________________________
1
Prior to 2011, Safeway recorded Blackhawk Network distribution commissions on the sale of certain gift cards net of the commissions shared with other retailers. In the first quarter of 2011, Safeway determined that these commissions should be reported on a gross basis. This change increased both revenue and cost of goods sold in 2011, but had no impact on identical-store sales, gross profit dollars or net income. Previously reported results are not adjusted because the impact is immaterial.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense decreased
98
basis points to
23.84%
of sales in the fourth quarter of
2011
from
24.82%
of sales in the fourth quarter of
2010
. Excluding the 49 basis-point impact of higher fuel sales and the 42 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, operating and administrative expense margin decreased seven basis points. This decrease was primarily the result of higher property gains, partly offset by higher expense to drive future growth at Blackhawk and higher IT expenses to support Safeway marketing programs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense declined to
$84.3 million
in the fourth quarter of
2011
from
$90.2 million
in the fourth quarter of
2010
due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average borrowings.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was
30.0%
of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter of
2011
compared to
31.5%
in the fourth quarter of
2010
. The fourth quarter income tax rate was lower in 2011 due to benefits from several individually immaterial items.
Annual Results
Net income for the fiscal year
2011
declined to
$516.7 million
(
$1.49
per diluted share) from net income for
2010
of
$589.8 million
(
$1.55
per diluted share), due primarily to the $98.9 million tax charge from the Canadian dividend paid in the first half of 2011. Excluding the
$0.29
per diluted share tax charge, diluted earnings per share would have been
$1.78
in fiscal 2011.
The gross profit margin declined 125 basis points to
27.03%
in
2011
from
28.28%
in
2010
. Excluding the 80 basis-point impact from fuel sales and the 32 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, gross profit declined 13 basis points, primarily due to increased LIFO expense. Operating and administrative expense decreased 102 basis points to
24.43%
in
2011
from
25.45%
in
2010
. Excluding the 69 basis-point impact from fuel sales and the 28 basis-point impact from the change in reporting gift card commissions, operating and administrative expense decreased five basis points. Income tax expense increased to 41.3% of pre-tax income in 2011 from 33.0% in 2010 primarily due to a tax charge resulting from the repatriation of $1.1 billion of earnings from Safeway's wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to
$2,023.6 million
in the year
2011
from
$1,849.7 million
in the year
2010
. This increase was due primarily to greater cash flow from working capital, partly offset by increased contributions to pension plans and lower net income.
Net cash flow used by investing activities increased to
$1,014.5 million
in the year
2011
from
$798.8 million
in
2010
primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partly offset by increased proceeds from the sale of property in 2011.
Net cash flow used by financing activities increased to
$1,077.3 million
in the year
2011
from
$768.1 million
in
2010
due primarily to a higher level of stock repurchases in 2011 compared to 2010, partly offset by net proceeds from increased borrowing in 2011.
