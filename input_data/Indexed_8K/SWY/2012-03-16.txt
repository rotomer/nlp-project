Defined Terms
. Wherever the following terms are used in this Agreement they shall have the meanings specified below, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Capitalized terms not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan and the Grant Notice.
(a)
Cause
 shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any written employment agreement between or among the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and Participant and, if no such written employment agreement shall be in force or effect, shall mean (a) conviction of, or the entry of a plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony or any other crime that causes the Company public disgrace or disrepute, or adversely affects the Company's operations, financial performance, or relationship with its customers; (b) misappropriation of funds or other property of the Company or its affiliates; (c) refusal to perform the lawful and reasonable directives of Participant's supervisor, the Company's Chief Executive Officer or the Board; (d) failure by Participant to perform the duties of his or her employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries which continues for a period of fourteen (14) days (other than by reason of illness or injury); or (e) material breach of any agreement with or duty owed to the Company or any of its affiliates. However, none of the foregoing events or conditions will constitute Cause unless the Company provides Participant with written notice of the event or condition and thirty (30) days to cure such event or condition (if curable) and the event or condition is not cured within such 30-day period.
(b)
Determination Date
 shall mean the date, as determined by the Administrator, on which the Administrator determines whether and to what extent the Performance Goals set forth on
Exhibit B
have been attained;
provided, however
, that the Determination Date with respect to the applicable Performance Period shall be no later than March 15 of the calendar year following the end of such Performance Period.
(c)
Good Reason
 shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in any written employment agreement between or among the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries and Participant and, if no such written employment agreement shall be in force or effect, shall mean the occurrence of any of the following, without Participant's prior consent: (a) a material, adverse change in Participant's responsibilities, authority or duties (including as a result of the assignment of duties materially inconsistent with Participant's position); (b) a material reduction in Participant's base salary; (c) a material transfer of Participant's principal place of employment to a location more than fifty (50) miles away from Participant's principal place of employment immediately prior to the Change in Control; or (d) the Company's material breach of this Agreement.

objection to the event or condition within ninety (90) days following the occurrence thereof; (y) the Company does not reverse or otherwise cure the event or condition within thirty (30) days of receiving that written objection; and (z) Participant resigns his or her employment within thirty (30) days following the expiration of that cure period.
(d)

Performance Share
 shall mean a nonvoting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11.3 of the Plan) solely for purposes of the Plan and this Agreement. The Performance Shares shall be used solely as a device for the determination of the payment to be made to Participant if such Performance Shares become payable pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof.

 shall mean a Termination of Services other than for Cause, after Participant has attained the age of 55.
(g)

 shall mean Participant's Termination of Consultancy, Termination of Directorship or Termination of Employment, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any payment or benefit constitutes non-exempt nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and such payment or benefit would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder by reason of Participant's Termination of Services, all references to Participant's Termination of Services shall be construed to mean a separation from service, as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) (a 
Separation from Service
), and Participant shall not be considered to have a Termination of Services unless such termination constitutes a Separation from Service with respect to Participant.
1.2

Grant of Performance Shares
. In consideration of Participant's agreement to remain in the service or employ of the Company or a Subsidiary and for other good and valuable consideration, effective as of the Grant Date set forth in the Grant Notice (the 
Grant Date
), the Company grants to Participant an award of Performance Shares as set forth in the Grant Notice, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement.
2.2    
Performance-Based Right to Payment
.
(a)    The number of Shares that shall be issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall be determined based on the Company's achievement of Performance Goals as set forth on
Exhibit B
. On the Determination Date, the Administrator in its sole discretion shall determine whether and to what extent the Performance Goals as set forth on
Exhibit B
have been attained. The payment of Shares with respect to Participant's Performance Shares is contingent on the attainment of the Performance Goals as set forth on
Exhibit B
. Accordingly, Participant will not become entitled to payment with respect to the Performance Shares subject to this Agreement unless and until the Administrator
A-2
determines that the Performance Goals set forth on
Exhibit B
have been attained. Upon such determination by the Administrator and subject to the provisions of the Plan and this Agreement, Participant shall be entitled to payment of that portion of the Performance Shares as corresponds to the Performance Goals attained (as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion) as set forth on
Exhibit
B
. Furthermore, pursuant to Section 2.5 (except as otherwise provided therein), in order to be entitled to payment with respect to any Performance Shares, Participant must be employed by the Company or an Affiliate on
the Payment Date.
(b)    As soon as administratively practicable following the Payment Date, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Determination Date (for the avoidance of doubt, this deadline is intended to comply with the short-term deferral exemption from Section 409A of the Code), the Company shall deliver to Participant (or any transferee permitted under Section 3.2 hereof) a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares or by entering such shares in book entry form, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) equal to the number of Performance Shares subject to this award that are payable pursuant to the achievement of the Performance Goals set forth on Exhibit B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Shares cannot be issued pursuant to Section 2.7(a), (b) or (c) hereof, then the Shares shall be issued pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as administratively practicable after the Administrator determines that Shares can again be issued in accordance with Sections 2.7(a), (b) and (c) hereof.
2.3    
Change in Control
. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement and pursuant to Section 11.3 of the Plan, if a Change in Control occurs and Participant has remained in the service of the Company continuously until at least immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall be earned as follows:
(a)    If the Administrator reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control, that the Performance Shares will not be honored or assumed, or new rights that substantially preserve the terms of the Performance Shares substituted therefor, by Participant's employer (or the parent of such employer) immediately following the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable immediately prior to the Change in Control and the number of Shares earned and issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall equal the greater of (a) the target number of Performance Shares set forth in the Grant Notice, and (b) the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned based on actual achievement of the Company's Performance Goals through the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control (calculated as if the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control had been the end of the Performance Period).
(b)    If the Administrator determines that the Performance Shares have been assumed and, before the Payment Date, Participant experiences a Termination of Services, other than for Cause, or Participant experiences a Termination of Services with Good Reason, within the one year period immediately following the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable upon such Termination of Services and the number of Shares earned and issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall equal the greater of (a) the target number of Performance Shares set forth in the Grant Notice, and (b) the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned based on actual achievement of the Company's Performance Goals through the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control (calculated as if the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control had been the end of the Performance Period).
(c)    Any Performance Shares which are earned pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be settled within 60 days of the Change in Control or Termination of Services, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.2.
A-3
2.4    
Consideration to the Company; No Employment Rights
. In consideration of the grant of the award of Performance Shares by the Company, Participant agrees to render faithful and efficient services to the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Company or a Subsidiary and Participant.
2.5    
Forfeiture, Termination and Cancellation upon Termination of Services
. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, upon Participant's Termination of Services for any or no reason, all rights with respect to any unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Participant, or Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be, will be entitled to no payments or benefits with respect thereto, unless the Administrator, as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Plan, determines in its sole discretion otherwise (in which case any payment to be made pursuant to this Award Agreement will be made on the Payment Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, within the period required by Section 409A of the Code, such that it qualifies as a short-term deferral pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Department of Treasury regulations);
provided, however
, that in the event of Participant's Termination of Services during the Performance Period by reason of death, disability or Retirement, Participant shall be entitled to receive, on the Payment Date, a portion of the unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement that would have been paid had Participant remained employed to the end of the Performance Period, prorated according to the number of full months that Participant was employed during the Performance Period.
2.6    
Withholding
.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to require payment by Participant of any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the grant of the Performance Shares or the issuance of the Shares, or any other taxable event related thereto. The Company may permit Participant to make such payment in one or more of the forms specified below:
(i)
by cash or check made payable to the Company;
(ii)
by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant;
(iii)
by tendering Shares (including, without limitation, Shares otherwise payable pursuant to the Performance Shares) which have a then-current Fair Market Value on the date of delivery not greater than the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's withholding obligation based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income tax and payroll tax purposes;
(iv)
by surrendering other property acceptable to the Administrator (including, without limitation, through the delivery of a notice that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares payable pursuant to the Performance Shares, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of its withholding obligations;
provided
that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale); or
A-4
(v)
in any combination of the foregoing.
(b)    In the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required by the Company pursuant to Section 2.6(a), the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to provide all or any portion of such required payment by means of tendering Shares in accordance with Section 2.6(a)(iii).
(c)    The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any new certificate representing Shares to Participant or Participant's legal representative or enter such Shares in book entry form unless and until Participant or Participant's legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state and local taxes applicable to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the grant of the Performance Shares or the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Performance Shares.

The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares deliverable hereunder or portion thereof prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions:
(a)    The admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed;
(b)    The completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any federal, state or foreign law or under regulations or rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, which the Administrator shall, in its discretion, deem necessary or advisable;
(c)    The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any federal, state or foreign governmental agency which the Administrator shall, in its discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; and
(d)    The receipt by the Company of full payment for all amounts which, under federal, state, local or foreign tax law, the Company (or other employer corporation) is required to withhold upon issuance of such Shares.

(a)    The number of Shares that shall be issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall be determined based on the Company's achievement of Performance Goals as set forth on
Exhibit B
. On the Determination Date, the Administrator in its sole discretion shall determine whether and to what extent the Performance Goals as set forth on
Exhibit B

the Payment Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Shares cannot be issued pursuant to Section 2.7(a), (b) or (c) hereof, then the Shares shall be issued pursuant to the preceding sentence as soon as administratively practicable after the Administrator determines that Shares can again be issued in accordance with Sections 2.7(a), (b) and (c) hereof.
2.3

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement and pursuant to Section 11.3 of the Plan, if a Change in Control occurs and Participant has remained in the service of the Company continuously until at least immediately prior to the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall be earned as follows:
(a)    If the Administrator reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control, that the Performance Shares will not be honored or assumed, or new rights that substantially preserve the terms of the Performance Shares substituted therefor, by Participant's employer (or the parent of such employer) immediately following the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable immediately prior to the Change in Control and the number of Shares earned and issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall equal the greater of (a) the target number of Performance Shares set forth in the Grant Notice, and (b) the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned based on actual achievement of the Company's Performance Goals through the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control (calculated as if the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control had been the end of the Performance Period).
(b)    If the Administrator determines that the Performance Shares have been assumed and, before the Payment Date, Participant experiences a Termination of Services, other than for Cause, or Participant experiences a Termination of Services with Good Reason, within the one year period immediately following the Change in Control, the Performance Shares shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable upon such Termination of Services and the number of Shares earned and issued pursuant to the Performance Shares shall equal the greater of (a) the target number of Performance Shares set forth in the Grant Notice, and (b) the number of Performance Shares that would have been earned based on actual achievement of the Company's Performance Goals through the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control (calculated as if the most recently completed fiscal year prior to such Change in Control had been the end of the Performance Period).
(c)    Any Performance Shares which are earned pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be settled within 60 days of the Change in Control or Termination of Services, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.2.

2.4    
Consideration to the Company; No Employment Rights
. In consideration of the grant of the award of Performance Shares by the Company, Participant agrees to render faithful and efficient services to the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in the employ or service of the Company or any Subsidiary or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Company or a Subsidiary and Participant.
2.5    
Forfeiture, Termination and Cancellation upon Termination of Services
. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, upon Participant's Termination of Services for any or no reason, all rights with respect to any unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Participant, or Participant's beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be, will be entitled to no payments or benefits with respect thereto, unless the Administrator, as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Plan, determines in its sole discretion otherwise (in which case any payment to be made pursuant to this Award Agreement will be made on the Payment Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, within the period required by Section 409A of the Code, such that it qualifies as a short-term deferral pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Department of Treasury regulations);
provided, however
, that in the event of Participant's Termination of Services during the Performance Period by reason of death, disability or Retirement, Participant shall be entitled to receive, on the Payment Date, a portion of the unpaid Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Agreement that would have been paid had Participant remained employed to the end of the Performance Period, prorated according to the number of full months that Participant was employed during the Performance Period.
A-4
2.6    
Withholding
.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to require payment by Participant of any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld with respect to the grant of the Performance Shares or the issuance of the Shares, or any other taxable event related thereto. The Company may permit Participant to make such payment in one or more of the forms specified below:

(ii)
by the deduction of such amount from other compensation payable to Participant;
(iii)
by tendering Shares (including, without limitation, Shares otherwise payable pursuant to the Performance Shares) which have a then-current Fair Market Value on the date of delivery not greater than the amount necessary to satisfy the Company's withholding obligation based on the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income tax and payroll tax purposes;
(iv)
by surrendering other property acceptable to the Administrator (including, without limitation, through the delivery of a notice that Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker with respect to Shares payable pursuant to the Performance Shares, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of its withholding obligations;
provided
that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company at such time as may be required by the Company, but in any event not later than the settlement of such sale); or
(v)
in any combination of the foregoing.
(b)    In the event Participant fails to provide timely payment of all sums required by the Company pursuant to Section 2.6(a), the Company shall have the right and option, but not the obligation, to treat such failure as an election by Participant to provide all or any portion of such required payment by means of tendering Shares in accordance with Section 2.6(a)(iii).
(c)    The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any new certificate representing Shares to Participant or Participant's legal representative or enter such Shares in book entry form unless and until Participant or Participant's legal representative shall have paid or otherwise satisfied in full the amount of all federal, state and local taxes applicable to the taxable income of Participant resulting from the grant of the Performance Shares or the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Performance Shares.
