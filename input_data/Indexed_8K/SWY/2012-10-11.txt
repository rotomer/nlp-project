Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (
see
General Instruction A.2. below):
The information in this Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of Safeway Inc., whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
On October 11, 2012, we issued our earnings press release for the third quarter of fiscal 2012. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
In the press release and our other public statements in connection with the press release, we use the following financial measures that are not measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP financial measures):
    
Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures - net income and net cash flow from operating activities - are provided in the press release. Reconciliations of free cash flow to GAAP cash flow for the 12 and 36 weeks ended September 8, 2012 and September 10, 2011 and to the forecasted range for fiscal 2012 are also provided in the press release. Given the rapid growth in the third-party gift card business and the highly seasonal nature of that business, with a significant portion of sales of third-party gift cards occurring in late December each year, management is unable to provide a meaningful estimate for payables related to third-party gift cards for 2012, and therefore is not able to provide a reconciliation of the forecasted range of free cash flow for fiscal 2012 to net cash flow from operating activities. Reconciliations of income from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada are also provided in the press release.
Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides information regarding various aspects of the cash that our business generates, which management believes is useful to understanding our business.
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt and the related ratios are useful measures of operating performance that facilitate management's evaluation of our ability to service debt and our capability to incur more debt to generate the cash needed to grow the business (including at times when interest rates fluctuate). Omitting interest, taxes and the other enumerated items provides a financial measure that is useful to management in assessing operating performance because the cash our business operations generate enables us to incur debt and thus to grow.
 
Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and the related ratios also facilitate comparisons of our results of operations with those of companies having different capital structures. Since the levels of indebtedness, tax structures, property impairment charges, methodologies in calculating LIFO expense and unconsolidated affiliates that other companies have are different from ours, we omit these amounts to facilitate investors' ability to make these comparisons. Similarly, we omit depreciation and amortization because other companies may employ a greater or lesser amount of owned property, and because, in management's experience, whether a store is new or fully or mostly depreciated does not necessarily correlate to the contribution that such store makes to operating performance.
Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our ability to generate Adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of our operating performance and that of other companies in our industry.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt, free cash flow and the related ratios are useful indicators of Safeway's ability to service debt, fund share repurchases and pay dividends that management believes will enhance stockholder value. Adjusted EBITDA also is a useful indicator of cash available for investing activities. A portion of the free cash flow that we generate in fiscal 2012 is expected to be spent on mandatory debt service requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures.
The exclusions included in income from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada relate to the income tax expense associated with repatriating earnings to the U.S. from the Company's Canadian subsidiary. Management believes that excluding this item provides a useful financial measure that will facilitate comparisons of our operating results before, during and after such charge was incurred, as well as facilitating comparisons of our performance with that of other companies that might not have the organizational structure that we have. Management also believes that investors, analysts and other interested parties view our income from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding tax on repatriated earnings from Canada as indicators of our ongoing operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other increases and decreases in cash as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a measure of liquidity. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Debt and free cash flow differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Additional limitations include:
Because of these and other limitations, our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these and other limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use our non-GAAP financial measures supplementally.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SAFEWAY INC. ANNOUNCES
THIRD
QUARTER
2012 RESULTS
Earnings per share up 18%
Free cash flow was $505 million

October 11, 2012
Results From Operations
Safeway Inc. today reported income from continuing operations of
$108.0 million
(
$0.45
per diluted share) for the
third
quarter of 2012 compared to
$130.3 million
(
$0.38
per diluted share) in the
third
quarter of 2011.
Our
just for U
loyalty program continues to gain momentum with our customers, and it is helping them save money every time they shop, said Steve Burd, Chairman and CEO. The incremental sales driven by
just for U
helped to offset lower inflation in the third quarter and improve volume share. We are pleased with our progress in operating profit. While our operating profit margin declined 30 basis points in the quarter, the decline is explained by items that will not continue in the fourth quarter."
"We are encouraged that in the fourth quarter to date our identical-store sales, excluding fuel, are running at 1.0% with slightly improved volumes and higher inflation than in the third quarter of 2012," added Burd. "We expect identical-store sales in the fourth quarter will be driven by increased
just for U
engagement, the roll out of our partner fuel loyalty program and the launch of our Wellness initiative.
Sales and Other Revenue
Sales and other revenue declined
0.2%
to
$10.0 billion
in the
third
quarter of 2012 from
$10.1 billion
in the
third
quarter of 2011, primarily due to the disposition of Genuardi's stores and a lower Canadian exchange rate, partly offset by higher fuel sales. Identical-store sales, excluding fuel, were 0.1% for the quarter, which were lower than anticipated primarily due to a larger than expected decline in price inflation, partly offset by continued improvement in volume.
Operating Profit
Operating profit declined 30 basis points from 2.47% in the third quarter of 2011 to 2.17% in the third quarter of 2012. Costs associated with the launch of
just for U
accounted for 23 basis points of this decline, and seven basis points resulted from the disposition of 17 Genuardi's stores. These costs will not continue in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Gross Profit
Gross profit declined
56
basis points to
26.44%
of sales in the
third
quarter of 2012 compared to
27.00%
of sales in the
third
quarter of 2011. Excluding the
11
basis-point impact from fuel sales, gross profit declined
45
basis points due primarily to costs incurred to launch our
just for U
loyalty program, costs incurred to dispose of Genuardi's stores, slightly higher shrink expense, higher revenue from Blackhawk (a lower gross margin business) and changes in sales mix, partly offset by lower LIFO expense.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense declined
26
basis points to
24.27%
of sales in the
third
quarter of 2012 from
24.53%
of sales in the
third
quarter of 2011. Excluding the
12
basis-point impact of higher fuel sales, operating and administrative expense margin declined
14
basis points, due primarily to higher gains from the sale of property and lower occupancy costs, partly offset by higher corporate pension expense and costs incurred to launch
just for U
.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased to
$71.3 million
in the
third
quarter of 2012 from
$60.7 million
in the
third
quarter of 2011 because of higher average borrowings, partly offset by lower average interest rates.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was
31.5%
of pre-tax income in the
third
quarter of 2012 compared to
33.6%
in the
third
quarter of 2011. The income tax rate was lower in the third quarter of 2012 due to individually immaterial items. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 33% for the remainder of 2012.
Discontinued Operations
In January 2012, Safeway announced the planned sale or closure of its Genuardi's stores. In the third quarter of 2012, Safeway closed one Genuardi's store and sold 16 Genuardi's stores for a pre-tax gain of
$80.4 million
(
$49.0 million
after tax) and cash proceeds of
$111 million
. Safeway expects to close the final three Genuardi's stores in the fourth quarter of 2012 for an estimated pre-tax loss of approximately
$17 million
($11 million after tax). For the year, we expect cash proceeds of approximately $112 million and a pre-tax gain of approximately $51 million ($31 million after tax).
36-Week Results
Income from continuing operations increased to
$311.2 million
(
$1.23
per diluted share) in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
from
$301.4 million
(
$0.85
per diluted share) in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
primarily due to the
$92.8 million
(
$0.26
per diluted share) tax expense on repatriated earnings from Canada recorded in the first 36 weeks of 2011. Excluding this charge, income from continuing operations would have been
$394.2 million
(
$1.11
per diluted share) in the first
36 weeks
of 2011.
The gross profit margin was
26.52%
in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
compared to
27.17%
in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
. Operating and administrative expense margin was
24.36%
of sales in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
compared to
24.70%
in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow provided by operating activities was
$358.5 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
compared to
$710.9 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
. This change was largely due to the higher use of cash for working capital in 2012, which was driven primarily by the settlement of Blackhawk payables and increased inventory (net of payables), partly offset by lower corporate pension
2
contributions.
Net cash flow used by investing activities declined to
$435.9 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
from
$744.4 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
primarily due to increased proceeds from the sale of properties and net cash proceeds from discontinued operations in 2012.
Net cash flow used by financing activities was
$448.6 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2012
compared to
$583.2 million
in the first
36 weeks
of
2011
. This change was due primarily to higher net proceeds from borrowings in 2012, partly offset by a higher level of stock repurchases in 2012.
Free cash flow was
$505.4 million
in the third quarter of 2012, which was used primarily to reduce debt by $468 million during the quarter.
Capital Expenditures
Safeway invested
$159.6 million
in capital expenditures in the
third
quarter of 2012, while opening
one
new Lifestyle store, completing
one
Lifestyle remodel, refurbishing in-store pharmacies and developing properties through our wholly owned subsidiary, Property Development Centers LLC. Safeway also closed
23
stores, including 17 Genuardi's stores sold or closed during the quarter. For the year, Safeway expects to invest approximately $900 million in capital expenditures to open approximately 10 new Lifestyle stores, complete approximately five Lifestyle remodels, refurbish in-store pharmacies and develop properties.
Stock Repurchases
Safeway did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the
third
quarter of 2012. For the first 36 weeks of 2012, Safeway repurchased 57.6 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $21.51 per share and a total cost of $1,240.3 million (including commissions). The remaining board authorization for stock repurchases at quarter-end was approximately
$0.8 billion
.
Guidance
Safeway's guidance for 2012 remains at $1.90 to $2.10 earnings per diluted share, operating profit margin change, excluding fuel, of negative five basis points to positive five basis points, and free cash flow of $850 million to $950 million.
