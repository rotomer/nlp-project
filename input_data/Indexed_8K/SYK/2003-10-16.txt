ITEM: Financial statements and exhibits
 
 
 
 
Stryker Corporation issued a press release on October 16, 2003 announcing its third quarter and first nine months 2003 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
In its press release, the Company has presented adjusted net earnings that exclude the impact of a restructuring charge and an acquisition-related credit reflected in the Company's results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002.  These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company's GAAP financial results.  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP information because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial information for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to understand potential future operating results.  The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the acquisition-related credit are sufficiently unique that similar items have not been recorded in the prior two fiscal years nor are they reasonably likely to recur within two years.  In addition, the Company reasonably believes that it is probable that the financial impact of each of these individual items will become insignificant by the end of 2004.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its financial statements and other publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.  A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before restructuring charge and acquisition-related credit is included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

            Domestic sales were $583.7 million for the third quarter and $1,697.1 million for the first nine months of 2003, representing increases of 18% in both periods, as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.
            International sales were $301.7 million for the third quarter and $926.9 million for the first nine months of 2003, representing increases of 20% and 24%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $22.9 million in the third quarter and by $98.9 million for the first nine months.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 11% in both the third quarter and for the first nine months.
            Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $505.6 million for the third quarter and $1,518.6 million for the first nine months of 2003, representing increases of 20% and 23%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants.

            Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $323.3 million for the third quarter and $940.3 million for the first nine months of 2003, representing increases of 17% in both periods based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and craniomaxillofacial implants.

            Physical Therapy Services revenues were $56.5 million for the third quarter and $165.1 million for the first nine months of 2003, representing increases of 13% and 10%, respectively, as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers.
            Restructuring and acquisition-related items were $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2002 as follows:
            The Company's effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2003 was reduced from 31.0% to 30.5% in the third quarter of 2003, thereby reducing income tax expense by $2.3 million.  This compares to a 33.0% effective income tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2002 and an effective annual income tax rate of 31.8% for the year ended December 31, 2002.  The income tax rate reductions result primarily from increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions.
