Kalamazoo, Michigan -- April 19, 2005 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported today that net sales were $1,202.5 million for the first quarter of 2005, representing a 16.2% increase over net sales of $1,035.1 million in the first quarter of 2004.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales increased 14.6% for the first quarter. 
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2005 were $173.1 million, representing a 27.4% increase over net earnings of $135.9 million in the first quarter of 2004.  Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter increased 27.3% to $.42 compared to $.33 in the first quarter of 2004. 
Domestic sales of $774.7 million increased 17.8% in the first quarter as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.
International sales of $427.8 million increased 13.4% in the first quarter as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $16.5 million in the quarter.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 9.0% in the quarter.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants of $714.4 million increased 12.8% in the first quarter based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, osteogenic protein-1 and bone cement.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 10.9% in the quarter.
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment of $423.0 million increased 23.8% in the first quarter based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, patient handling and emergency medical equipment and surgical navigation systems.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 22.5% in the quarter.
Physical Therapy Services revenues of $65.1 million increased 7.8% in the first quarter as a result of added revenue from new physical therapy centers.
The Company's effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2005 was reduced to 29.5% as compared to a 30.0% effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2004 and an effective annual income tax rate of 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004.   The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflected the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of substantially all of the $120 million upfront payment made in the third quarter of 2004 to acquire SpineCore, Inc.  The income tax rate reduction in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004 results primarily from increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions.
