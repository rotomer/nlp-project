Net sales were $1,218.6 million for the second quarter of 2005, representing a 16.8% increase over net sales of $1,043.0 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $2,421.1 million for the first half of 2005, representing a 16.5% increase over net sales of $2,078.1 million for the first half of 2004.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales increased 15.1% for the second quarter and 14.8% for the first half.

Diluted net earnings per share for the second quarter increased 21.6% to $.45 compared to $.37 in the second quarter of 2004.

Domestic sales were $784.1 million for the second quarter and $1,558.8 million for the first half of 2005, representing increases of 15.8% and 16.8%, respectively, as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.
 
International sales were $434.5 million for the second quarter and $862.3 million for the first half of 2005, representing increases of 18.8% and 16.1%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $18.2 million in the second quarter and by $34.7 million in the first half.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 13.8% in the second quarter and 11.4% in the first half.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $724.8 million for the second quarter and $1,439.2 million for the first half of 2005, representing increases of 14.9% and 13.9%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, osteogenic protein-1 and bone cement.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 12.7% in the second quarter and 11.8% in the first half.
 
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $427.4 million for the second quarter and $850.4 million for the first half of 2005, representing increases of 22.3% and 23.1%, respectively, based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and operating room equipment, endoscopic products and patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 21.0% in the second quarter and 21.8% in the first half.
 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $66.4 million for the second quarter and $131.5 million for the first half of 2005, representing increases of 6.1% and 6.9%, respectively, as a result of added revenue from new physical therapy centers.
 
 
The Company's effective income tax rate for the second quarter and first half of 2005 was reduced to 29.5% as compared to a 30.0% effective income tax rate for the second quarter and first half of 2004 and an effective annual income tax rate of 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflected the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of substantially all of the $120 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2004 to acquire SpineCore, Inc.  The income tax rate reduction in the first half of 2005 compared to the first half of 2004 results primarily from increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions.
