            Stryker Corporation issued a press release on October 18, 2005 announcing its third quarter and first nine months 2005 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            In its press release, the Company has presented adjusted net earnings that exclude the impact of the income tax expense associated with the planned repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act reflected in the Company's results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 as well as a purchased in-process research and development charge reflected in its results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004.  This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure.  A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before the additional income tax expense associated with the planned repatriation of foreign earnings and the purchased in-process research and development charge is included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

The Company's third quarter of 2004 net earnings were reduced by a $120.8 million charge to write-off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of SpineCore, Inc.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2005 were $132.1 million compared to net earnings of $14.4 million in the third quarter of 2004.

Domestic sales were $775.5 million for the third quarter and $2,334.3 million for the first nine months of 2005, representing increases of 14.1% and 15.9%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.
 
International sales were $396.4 million for the third quarter and $1,258.7 million for the first nine months of 2005, representing increases of 13.6% and 15.3%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $4.1 million in the third quarter and by $38.8 million in the first nine months.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12.4% in the third quarter and 11.7% in the first nine months.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $677.9 million for the third quarter and $2,117.1 million for the first nine months of 2005, representing increases of 10.6% and 12.8%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, osteogenic protein-1 and bone cement.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 10.2% in the third quarter and 11.3% in the first nine months.
 
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $428.1 million for the third quarter and $1,278.5 million for the first nine months of 2005, representing increases of 20.5% and 22.2%, respectively, based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and operating room equipment, endoscopic products and patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20.1% in the third quarter and 21.2% in the first nine months.
 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $65.9 million for the third quarter and $197.4 million for the first nine months of 2005, representing increases of 8.9% and 7.6%, respectively, as a result of added revenue from new physical therapy centers.
 
 
On September 27, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately $722 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.  The Act provides a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost.  The Company recorded a charge of $31.3 million, or $.08 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005 to recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the planned repatriation.  The repatriation of funds will occur in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
 
The Company completed its acquisition of SpineCore, Inc. during the third quarter of 2004 for an upfront payment of $120 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical spinal discs.  The transaction resulted in a charge against both pre-tax and net earnings of $120.8 million, or $.29 per diluted share, to write off purchased in-process research and development.
 
 
The Company's effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 were 43.0% and 33.7%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 of 80.1% and 37.5%, respectively, and an effective annual income tax rate of 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 reflect the impact of the $31.3 million in income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.  The effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of substantially all of the $120.8 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2004 to acquire SpineCore, Inc.
