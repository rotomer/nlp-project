            In its press release, the Company has presented adjusted net earnings that exclude the impact of the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act reflected in the Company's results for the three month and full year periods ended December 31, 2005 as well as purchased in-process research and development charges reflected in its results for the three month and full year periods ended December 31, 2005 and the full year period ended December 31, 2004.  This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure.  A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before the additional income tax expense associated with the planned repatriation of foreign earnings and the purchased in-process research and development charges is included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan -- January 26, 2006 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 as follows:
 
 
 
 
Net sales were $1,278.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, representing a 10.6% increase over net sales of $1,155.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $4,871.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing a 14.3% increase over net sales of $4,262.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales increased 13.0% for the fourth quarter and 14.0% for the year.
The Company's fourth quarter of 2005 net earnings were reduced by a $15.9 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol Corp. and were increased by a $3.9 million reduction in the previously recorded income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The fourth quarter adjustment reduced the repatriation income tax expense charge for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $27.4 million.
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $185.7 million, representing a 14.1% increase over net earnings of $162.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased 12.5% to $.45 compared to $.40 in the fourth quarter of 2004.  Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $675.2 million, representing a 45.0% increase over net earnings of $465.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.  Diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 43.9% to $1.64 compared to $1.14 for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Excluding the fourth quarter 2005 impacts of the $15.9 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition and the $3.9 million reduction in income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $197.7 million, representing a 21.5% increase over net earnings of $162.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $.48, representing a 20.0% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $.40 for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Excluding the annual impacts of the charges of $15.9 million to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition in 2005, $27.4 million to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 and $120.8 million to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of SpineCore, Inc. in 2004, adjusted net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $718.5 million, representing a 22.5% increase over adjusted net earnings of $586.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.75, representing a 22.4% increase over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.43 for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Domestic sales were $831.3 million for the fourth quarter and $3,165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing increases of 12.6% and 15.0%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services.
International sales were $447.2 million for the fourth quarter and $1,705.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing increases of 7.1% and 13.0%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $27.3 million in the fourth quarter and favorable by $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 13.7% in the fourth quarter and 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $738.0 million for the fourth quarter and $2,855.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing increases of 7.6% and 11.4%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, OP-1 and bone cement.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 10.9% in the fourth quarter and 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $475.3 million for the fourth quarter and $1,753.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing increases of 16.4% and 20.5%, respectively, based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and operating room equipment, endoscopic products and patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17.6% in the fourth quarter and 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $65.2 million for the fourth quarter and $262.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing increases of 6.2% and 7.2%, respectively, as a result of added revenue from new physical therapy centers.
The Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp., a private, development stage company, during the fourth quarter of 2005 for a total cost of $17.5 million, including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities.  PlasmaSol has developed a technology which should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use in sterilizing certain of its MedSurg Equipment products.  The transaction resulted in a charge against both pre-tax and net earnings of $15.9 million, or $.04 per diluted share, to write off purchased in-process research and development costs.
In September 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a plan to repatriate $722 million of undistributed foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.  The Company recorded a charge of $31.3 million, or $.08 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005 to recognize the estimated income tax expense and related liability associated with the planned repatriation.  The repatriation of funds was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005, and the actual income tax expense and related liability totaled $27.4 million, or $.07 per diluted share.  As a result, the previously recorded income tax expense was reduced by $3.9 million, or $.01 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
The Company completed its acquisition of SpineCore, Inc. during the third quarter of 2004 for an upfront payment of $120 million in cash plus certain transaction costs.  SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical spinal discs.  The transaction resulted in a charge against both pre-tax and net earnings of $120.8 million, or $.29 per diluted share, to write off purchased in-process research and development costs.
The Company's effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 were 29.8% and 32.7%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 of 30.0% and 35.0%, respectively.  The effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 reflect the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased research and development charge associated with the acquisition of SpineCore.
The Company's outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly-based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United States, Japan and certain other foreign markets.  The Company projects diluted net earnings per share for 2006 of $2.02, an increase of 21.0% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005, after reductions in net earnings resulting from the recognition of the cost of employee stock options in both years.  The financial forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services, offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% to 3% in the first quarter of 2006 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% for the full year of 2006.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects annual net sales growth in the range of 12% to 15% in 2006, which is comparable to the 14% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the full year of 2005.
