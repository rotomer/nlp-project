Stryker Corporation issued a press release on July 20, 2006 announcing its second quarter 2006 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
            In its press release, the Company has presented adjusted net earnings that exclude the impact of a purchased in-process research and development charge reflected in the Company's results for the six month period ended June 30, 2006.  This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure.  A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before the purchased in-process research and development charge recognized in the first quarter of 2006 is included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan -- July 20, 2006 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 as follows:
"We once again delivered on our commitments in the quarter, including strong net earnings growth and the continuing turnaround of our U.S. Orthopaedics division, which reported its third straight quarter of sequentially improved sales growth," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were also particularly pleased by very strong MedSurg growth overseas, which helped offset softer International implant sales growth."
 
Net sales were $1,327.9 million for the second quarter of 2006, representing a 9.0% increase over net sales of $1,218.6 million in the second quarter of 2005, and $2,648.8 million for the first half of 2006, representing a 9.4% increase over net sales of $2,421.1 million for the first half of 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales increased 9.4% for the second quarter and 10.8% for the first half.
 
The second quarter and first half results reflect the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R, , which requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options as compensation expense.  The Company adopted the Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method, under which all prior period amounts have been restated on a consistent basis.  As a result of adopting Statement No. 123R, the Company recognized additional compensation expense of $14.2 million and $10.1 million in the second quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $29.0 million and $19.9 million in the first half of 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Share-Based Payment
 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2006 were $213.9 million, representing a 20.3% increase over net earnings of $177.8 million for the second quarter of 2005.  Diluted net earnings per share for the second quarter of 2006 increased 20.9% to $.52 compared to $.43 in the second quarter of 2005.
 
The Company's net earnings for the first half of 2006 were reduced by a $52.7 million charge in the first quarter to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd. (Sightline).
 
Excluding the impact of the $52.7 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development, adjusted net earnings for the first half of 2006 were $414.1 million, representing a 20.2% increase over net earnings of $344.5 million for the first half of 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the first half of 2006 were $1.01, representing a 20.2% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $.84 for the first half of 2005.
 
Reported net earnings for the first half of 2006 were $361.4 million, representing a 4.9% increase over net earnings of $344.5 million in the first half of 2005.  Reported diluted net earnings per share for the first half of 2006 increased 4.8% to $.88 compared to $.84 in the first half of 2005.
 
Domestic sales were $864.0 million for the second quarter and $1,731.9 million for the first half of 2006, representing increases of 10.2% and 11.1%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.
 
International sales were $463.9 million for the second quarter and $916.9 million for the first half of 2006, representing increases of 6.8% and 6.3%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $4.9 million in the second quarter and by $34.8 million in the first half of 2006.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 7.9% in the second quarter and 10.4% in the first half of 2006.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $771.1 million for the second quarter and $1,534.7 million for the first half of 2006, representing increases of 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 7.3% in the second quarter and 8.9% in the first half of 2006.
 
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $490.7 million for the second quarter and $981.0 million for the first half of 2006, representing increases of 14.5% and 15.0%, respectively, based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 14.4% in the second quarter and 15.5% in the first half of 2006.
 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $66.1 million for the second quarter and $133.1 million for the first half of 2006, representing a decrease of 0.5% and an increase of 1.2%, respectively.
 
The Company's effective income tax rates for the second quarter and first half of 2006 were 27.9% and 31.0%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates for the second quarter, first half and year ended December 31, 2005 of 29.2%, 29.3% and 32.6%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the first half of 2006 reflects the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the Sightline acquisition, for the first half of 2006 was reduced from 28.5% to 28.2% in the second quarter of 2006, thereby reducing income tax expense by $1.8 million. The income tax rate reduction results primarily from increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions and a favorable change in U.S. tax legislation enacted during the second quarter. The effective income tax rates for the 2005 periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 also reflects the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol Corp. as well as the third and fourth quarter 2005 income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
 
 
The Company's outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United States, Japan and certain other foreign markets.  The Company projects adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2006 of $2.02, excluding the impact of the charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline during the first quarter of 2006.  The projection represents a 21.0% increase over adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005.
 
The financial forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services, offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near recent levels, the Company does not expect a significant impact on net sales in the third quarter and anticipates an unfavorable impact of 0% to 1% for the full year of 2006.  Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects annual net sales growth in the range of 11% to 13% in 2006, which is comparable to the 11% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the first half of 2006.
