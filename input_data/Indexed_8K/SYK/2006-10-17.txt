Stryker Corporation issued a press release on October 17, 2006 announcing its third quarter 2006 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
            In its press release, the Company has presented adjusted net earnings that exclude the impact of a purchased in-process research and development charge reflected in the Company's results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2006 as well as the impact of the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act reflected in the Company's results for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005.  This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure.  A reconciliation of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before the purchased in-process research and development charge and the additional income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings is included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Kalamazoo, Michigan - October 17, 2006 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 as follows:
 
"We are pleased to report another strong quarter with double-digit sales growth and very strong earnings growth led by the resurgence of our U.S. Orthopaedics division. This division posted double-digit sales growth for the first time since late 2004, including 11% growth in reconstructive products, and recorded its fourth straight quarter of sequentially improved sales growth," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our MedSurg businesses also continued to generate solid results."
 
Net sales were $1,294.0 million for the third quarter of 2006, representing a 10.4% increase over net sales of $1,171.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, and $3,942.8 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing a 9.7% increase over net sales of $3,593.0 million for the first nine months of 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales increased 9.8% for the third quarter and 10.5% for the first nine months.
 
The third quarter and first nine months results reflect the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R, , which requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options as compensation expense.  The Company adopted the Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method, under which all prior period amounts have been restated on a consistent basis.  As a result of adopting Statement No. 123R, the Company recognized additional compensation expense of $14.6 million and $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $43.6 million and $37.4 million in the first nine months of 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Share-Based Payment
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were $188.4 million, representing a 56.1% increase over net earnings of $120.7 million for the third quarter of 2005.  Diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 increased 58.6% to $.46 compared to $.29 in the third quarter of 2005.  Net earnings for the first nine months of 2006 were $549.8 million, representing an 18.2% increase over net earnings of $465.2 million in the first nine months of 2005.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first nine months of 2006 increased 18.6% to $1.34 compared to $1.13 in the first nine months of 2005.
 
The Company's net earnings for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2005 were reduced by a $31.3 million charge in the third quarter to record the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The Company's net earnings for the first nine months of 2006 were reduced by a $52.7 million charge in the first quarter to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd. (Sightline).
 
Excluding the impact of the charge to record the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in the third quarter of 2005, net earnings for the third quarter of 2006 of $188.4 million increased by 23.9% over adjusted net earnings of $152.0 million for the third quarter of 2005 and diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter of 2006 of $.46 increased by 24.3% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $.37 for the third quarter of 2005.
 
Excluding the impact of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2006 and to record the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in the third quarter of 2005, adjusted net earnings for the first nine months of 2006 were $602.5 million, representing a 21.3% increase over adjusted net earnings of $496.5 million for the first nine months of 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the first nine months of 2006 were $1.47, representing a 21.5% increase over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.21 for the first nine months of 2005.
 
Domestic sales were $864.3 million for the third quarter and $2,596.2 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing increases of 11.5% and 11.2%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
 
International sales were $429.7 million for the third quarter and $1,346.6 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing increases of 8.4% and 7.0%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $6.9 million in the third quarter and unfavorable by $27.9 million in the first nine months of 2006.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 6.7% in the third quarter and 9.2% in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $741.6 million for the third quarter and $2,276.3 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing increases of 9.6% and 7.7%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9.0% in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2006.
 
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $489.5 million for the third quarter and $1,470.5 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing increases of 14.0% and 14.6%, respectively, based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13.4% in the third quarter and 14.8% in the first nine months of 2006.
 
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $62.9 million for the third quarter and $196.0 million for the first nine months of 2006, representing decreases of 4.6% and 0.7%, respectively.
The Company's effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2006 were 28.2% and 30.1%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates for the third quarter, first nine months and year ended December 31, 2005 of 43.7%, 33.7% and 32.6%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2006 reflects the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rates for the 2005 periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R.  The effective income tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 also reflect the impact of the third quarter 2005 income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 also reflects the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol Corp. as well as the third and fourth quarter 2005 income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
 
The Company's outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United States, Japan and certain other foreign markets.  The Company continues to project adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2006 of $2.02, excluding the impact of the charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline during the first quarter of 2006.  The projection represents a 21.0% increase over adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005.
 
The financial forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase of approximately 11% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, which is equal to the 11% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the first nine months of 2006. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near recent levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and does not expect a significant impact on net sales for the full year of 2006.
 
The Company is also optimistic about its outlook for 2007 despite the potential for increased pricing pressures in certain markets. The Company projects diluted net earnings per share to approximate $2.42 for 2007 as a result of its broad range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties along with the expected continuing strength in the underlying growth rates for these products.
