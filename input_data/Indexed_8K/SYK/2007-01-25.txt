Stryker Corporation issued a press release on January 25, 2007 announcing its fourth quarter and year end 2006 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
                          In its press release, the Company made references to the following non-GAAP financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  These items include purchased in-process research and development charges recorded in 2006 and 2005 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2005.  Given the nature of these items, management believes that excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the Company's past and potential future operational performance.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  Reconciliations of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings and reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share before the purchased in-process research and development charges and the additional income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings are included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Kalamazoo, Michigan - January 25, 2007 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 as follows:
 
"Our unique set of businesses delivered a strong finish to 2006, especially in the U.S.," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Our U.S. orthopaedic implant franchises were strong in the quarter, up 17% collectively, and our global endoscopy business was up over 25% in the quarter behind a renewed product cycle."
Net sales were $1,462.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, representing a 14.4% increase over net sales of $1,278.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, and $5,405.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an 11.0% increase over net sales of $4,871.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 12.6% for the fourth quarter and 11.1% for the year.
The fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 results reflect the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123R, , which requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options as compensation expense.  The Company adopted the Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method, under which all prior period amounts have been restated on a consistent basis.  As a result of adopting Statement No. 123R, the Company recognized additional compensation expense of $12.6 million and $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $56.2 million and $48.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company's fourth quarter of 2005 net earnings were reduced by a $15.9 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol) and were increased by a $3.9 million reduction in the previously recorded income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  The fourth quarter adjustment reduced the repatriation income tax expense charge for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $27.4 million.  The Company's net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 were reduced by a $52.7 million charge in the first quarter to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd. (Sightline).
Excluding the fourth quarter 2005 impacts of the $15.9 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition and the $3.9 million reduction in income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $227.9 million, increased by 19.7% over adjusted net earnings of $190.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 and diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $.55 increased by 19.6% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $.46 for the fourth quarter of 2005.
Excluding the annual impacts of the charges of $52.7 million to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the Sightline acquisition in 2006, $15.9 million to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition in 2005 and $27.4 million to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $830.4 million, representing a 20.9% increase over adjusted net earnings of $686.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.02, representing a 21.0% increase over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Domestic sales were $960.6 million for the fourth quarter and $3,556.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing increases of 15.6% and 12.4%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
International sales were $502.2 million for the fourth quarter and $1,848.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing increases of 12.3% and 8.4%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $22.7 million in the fourth quarter and unfavorable by $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 7.2% for the fourth quarter and 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $833.8 million for the fourth quarter and $3,110.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing increases of 13.2% and 9.1%, respectively, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 11.0% in the fourth quarter and 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $566.6 million for the fourth quarter and $2,037.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing increases of 18.8% and 15.8%, respectively, based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17.5% in the fourth quarter and 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $62.4 million for the fourth quarter and $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing decreases of 4.3% and 1.6%, respectively.
 
The Company's effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 were 28.2% and 29.5%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 of 29.5% and 32.6%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rates for the 2005 periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R.  The effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 reflect the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.
 
The Company's outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will approximate $2.42, an increase of 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.02 in 2006.  The financial forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 0% to 1% for the full year of 2007.
