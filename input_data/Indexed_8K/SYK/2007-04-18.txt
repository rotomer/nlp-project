Stryker Corporation issued a press release on April 18, 2007 announcing its first quarter 2007 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude the purchased in-process research and development charge recorded in 2006 which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  Given the nature of this item, management believes that excluding it from certain financial metrics is more representative of the Company's past and potential future operational performance.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  Reconciliations of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings and reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share before the purchased in-process research and development charge are included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan - April 18, 2007 -- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 as follows:
"Our U.S. orthopaedic implant franchises delivered another strong quarter, up 14% collectively, leading us to a strong start in 2007," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our MedSurg franchises also had a very good quarter, especially in international markets where combined sales of our Instruments and Endoscopy products grew 19% on a constant currency basis."
Net sales were $1,489.3 million for the first quarter of 2007, representing a 12.7% increase over net sales of $1,320.9 million for the first quarter of 2006. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 10.9% for the first quarter.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2007 were $243.5 million, representing a 65.1% increase over net earnings of $147.5 million for the first quarter of 2006.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 increased 63.9% to $.59 compared to $.36 for the first quarter of 2006. 
The Company's first quarter 2006 net earnings were reduced by a $52.7 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd. (Sightline).
Excluding the first quarter 2006 impact of the $52.7 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development, net earnings for the first quarter of 2007 of $243.5 million increased by 21.6% over adjusted net earnings of $200.2 million for the first quarter of 2006 and diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2007 of $.59 increased by 20.4% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $.49 for the first quarter of 2006.
Domestic sales were $977.0 million for the first quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 12.6% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 
International sales were $512.3 million for the first quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 13.1% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $24.2 million in the first quarter of 2007.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 7.7% in the first quarter of 2007.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $860.0 million for the first quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 12.6% based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  , sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 10.3% in the first quarter of 2007.
On a constant currency basis
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $565.5 million for the first quarter of 2007, representing an increase of 15.3% based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 14.1% in the first quarter of 2007.
Physical Therapy Services revenues were $63.8 million for the first quarter representing a decrease of 4.8%.
 
The Company's effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2007 was 28.2%, as compared to effective income tax rates for the first quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 of 35.1% and 29.5%, respectively.  The effective income tax rates for the first quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline.
The Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, , on January 1, 2007.  Upon adoption, the Company recognized an increase in the interest accrual associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income taxes).  In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of future income tax payments.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
 
The Company's outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for continued pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will approximate $2.42, an increase of 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.02 in 2006.  The financial forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 1.5% in the second quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2007.
