Stryker Corporation issued a press release on October 17, 2007 announcing its third quarter 2007 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."  These financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2007 and the purchased in-process research and development charge recorded in the first quarter of 2006, both of which affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  Given the nature of these items, management believes that excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the Company's past and potential future operational performance.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  Reconciliations of reported net earnings from continuing operations to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations before the intangible asset impairment and the purchased in-process research and development charges are included in the Company's press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
"Our unique set of businesses and a strong focus on execution helped us deliver another excellent quarter," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Domestic sales were particularly strong, with Orthopaedic Implants growing 16% and MedSurg up 20%, while international sales growth accelerated to 11% operationally."
Net sales were $1,453.2 million for the third quarter of 2007, representing an 18.0% increase over net sales of $1,231.1 million for the third quarter of 2006, and were $4,342.4 million for the first nine months of 2007, representing a 15.9% increase over net sales of $3,746.8 million for the first nine months of 2006.  On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 15.7% for the third quarter and 13.9% for the first nine months.
Net earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2007 were $228.7 million, representing a 22.3% increase over net earnings from continuing operations of $187.0 million for the third quarter of 2006.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2007 increased 22.2% to $.55 compared to $.45 for the third quarter of 2006.
Net earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 were reduced by a $12.7 million intangible asset impairment charge (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products recorded in the second quarter.  Net earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 were reduced by a $52.7 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the first quarter 2006 acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd. (Sightline).
Excluding the impact of the $12.7 million intangible asset impairment recorded in the second quarter of 2007 and the $52.7 million charge to write off purchased in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 of $723.3 million increased 21.1% over adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $597.4 million for the first nine months of 2006 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 of $1.74 increased by 20.0% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.45 for the first nine months of 2006.
Net earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 were $710.6 million, representing a 30.5% increase over net earnings from continuing operations of $544.7 million for the first nine months of 2006.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 increased 28.8% to $1.70 compared to $1.32 for the first nine months of 2006.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business. This sale resulted in a second quarter 2007 gain of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $.06 per diluted share.  Net earnings from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2006 were $1.4 million. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the first nine months of 2007 were $5.0 million compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $5.1 million for the first nine months of 2006. 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2007 were $228.7 million, representing a 21.4% increase over net earnings of $188.4 million for the third quarter of 2006.  Diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter of 2007 increased 19.6% to $.55 compared to $.46 for the third quarter of 2006.  Net earnings for the first nine months of 2007 were $741.3 million, representing a 34.8% increase over net earnings of $549.8 million for the first nine months of 2006.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first nine months of 2007 increased 32.8% to $1.78 compared to $1.34 for the first nine months of 2006.
Domestic sales were $946.0 million for the third quarter and $2,795.7 million for the first nine months of 2007, representing increases of 18.0% and 16.5%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.
International sales were $507.2 million for the third quarter and $1,546.7 million for the first nine months of 2007, representing increases of 18.0% and 14.9%, respectively, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $28.8 million in the third quarter and by $75.6 million in the first nine months of 2007.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 11.3% in the third quarter and 9.2% in the first nine months of 2007.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $855.9 million for the third quarter and $2,599.2 million for the first nine months of 2007, representing increases of 15.4% and 14.2%, respectively based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1.  On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 12.6% in the third quarter and 11.8% in the first nine months of 2007.
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $597.3 million for the third quarter and $1,743.2 million for the first nine months of 2007, representing increases of 22.0% and 18.5%, respectively based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20.3% in the third quarter and 17.1% in the first nine months of 2007.
The Company's effective income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 were 28.1% and 27.9%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates on such earnings for the third quarter, first nine months and year ended December 31, 2006 of 28.1%, 30.0% and 29.5%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit).  The effective income tax rates for the first nine months and year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the impact of the non-deductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline.
The Company's outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth rates in the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for continued pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for 2007 will approximate $2.40, an increase of 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.00 in 2006.  The latest financial forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 13.0% to 13.5%, up from the previous forecast of 12% to 13% growth, as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.5% to 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.1% to 2.3% for the full year of 2007.
