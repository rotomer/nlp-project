(a)  On October 24, 2007, the Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation adopted amendments to the Company's By-Laws.  The amendments were made primarily to allow for the issuance of uncertificated shares, to provide that shareholders must give advance notice to the Company of any business that they propose to bring before an annual meeting or of any person to be nominated as a director, to allow the Company to apply current information technologies to board and shareholder notices and meetings, to revise the indemnification provisions, to opt out of the provisions of the Michigan Control Share Acquisition Statute and to update the By-Laws for changes in Michigan law since the By-Laws were last revised.  A summary of principal changes effected by the amendments follows:

Annual Meeting
Section 2.2.            .  No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.2 and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.
Nature of Business at Meetings of Stockholder
For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
            To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such shareholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (v) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
No business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders except for such business as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.  If the chairman of an annual or special meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
Section 2.3.            .  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of shareholders, or at any special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (a) at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.
Nomination of Directors
For a nomination to be made by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made; and (b) in the case of a special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made.
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director all information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice (i) the name and record address of such shareholder, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such shareholder, (iv) a representation that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (v) any other information relating to such shareholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
Section 2.4.            .  Special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, by the President or by order of the Board of Directors.  Special meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place and on such date and at such time as shall be designated in the notice of meeting.
Special Meetings
Section 2.5.            .  Written notice of each annual and special meeting of shareholders, stating the time, place and purposes thereof, shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  Such notice may be given personally, by mail or by a form of electronic transmission to which the shareholder has consented.  If a shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at a meeting by remote communication, the means of remote communication allowed shall be included in the notice of the meeting.
Notice of Meetings
Section 2.6.            .  If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may participate in a meeting of shareholders by conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting may communicate with the other participants and shall be considered present in person and may vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (a) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to verify that each person considered present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxy holder; (b) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to provide each shareholder and proxy holder a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, (c) if any shareholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation and (d) all participants are advised of the means of remote communication and the names of the participants in the meeting are divulged to all participants.
Participation by Remote Communication
Section 2.7.            .  The officer or agent who has charge of the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall make and certify a complete list, based upon the record date for a meeting of shareholders determined pursuant to Section 5.8 hereof, of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged alphabetically within each class and series, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder.  Such list shall be produced at the time and place of the meeting and may be inspected by any shareholder during the entire meeting.  If a meeting of shareholders is held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder during the entire meeting by posting the list on a reasonably accessible electronic network and the information required to access the list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
List of Shareholders Entitled to Vote
            Such list shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine the list or to vote in person or by proxy at the meeting.
Section 2.8.            .  Any meeting of shareholders may be adjourned to another time or place, and the Corporation may transact at any adjourned meeting only business that could have been transacted at the original meeting unless notice of the adjourned meeting is given.  Notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.  If notice of an adjourned meeting is given, such notice shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in the manner prescribed in these By-Laws for the giving of notice of meetings.  A shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at the adjourned meeting by means of a remote communication if he or she was permitted to be present and vote by that means of remote communication in the original meeting notice.
Adjourned Meetings and Notice Thereof
Section 2.9.            .  At any meeting of shareholders, except as otherwise provided in the MBCA, the holders of record of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes at a meeting constitute a quorum at the meeting.  The shareholders present in person or by proxy at such meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.  Whether or not a quorum is present, the meeting may be adjourned by a vote of the shares present.  When the holders of a class or series of shares are entitled to vote separately on an item of business, this Section 2.9 applies in determining the presence of a quorum of such class or series for transaction of the item of business.
Quorum
Section 2.10.        .  At any meeting of shareholders each outstanding share of stock having voting power shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to vote at such meeting, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation.  A vote may be cast either orally or in writing and otherwise as provided in these By-Laws.  If an action other than the election of directors is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote on the action, unless a greater vote is required by the MBCA.  Abstaining from a vote or submitting a ballot marked "abstain" with respect to an action is not a vote cast on that action.  Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election.
Voting; Proxies
Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy.  Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy, the following methods constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant authority to another person to act as proxy: (a) the execution of a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy, which may be accomplished by the shareholder or by an authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature; and (b) transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will hold the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or similar agent fully authorized by the person who will hold the proxy to receive that transmission.  Any telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder.  If a telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission is determined to be valid, the inspectors of election, or, if there are no inspectors, the persons making the determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.  No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  The authority of the holder of a proxy to act is not revoked by the incompetence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless, before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of the incompetence or death is received by the officer or agent responsible for maintaining the list of shareholders.
Section 2.11.        .  At each meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President or such other person designated by the Board of Directors shall preside and act as the chairman of the meeting.  The chairman shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority to establish rules for the conduct of the meeting, which may include, without limitation, the following:  (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.

Annual Meeting of Board of Directors
            Section 3.10.    .  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.

Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called from time to time by the Chairman of the Board or the President and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary upon the written request of a majority of the whole Board of Directors directed to the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary.

Such notice shall be given personally, by telephone, by overnight courier or by a form of electronic transmission not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the meeting (or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances).
Special Meetings
            Section 3.12.    .  The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation.

Any committee, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions creating such committee, shall have and may exercise all powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, subject to any limitation by the MBCA or these By-Laws.  No such committee shall have the power or authority with regard to amending the Articles of Incorporation (except that a committee may prescribe the relative rights and preferences of the shares of series of preferred stock permitted to be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation), adopting an agreement of merger or share exchange, recommending to the shareholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the shareholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, amending these By-Laws or filling vacancies on the Board of Directors or fixing compensation of the directors for serving on the Board of Directors or on a committee thereof and, unless a resolution of the Board of Directors so provides, declaring a distribution or dividend or authorizing the issuance of shares.
Powers and Duties of Committees
Each committee may adopt its own rules of procedure and may meet at stated times or on such notice as such committee may determine and, unless otherwise provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors, may designate one or more subcommittees, each of which shall consist of one or more members, to which all or part of the power and authority of the committee may be delegated.  Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors.
            Section 3.14.    .   A majority of the members of the Board of Directors then in office and, unless the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing the committee provides otherwise, of the members of a committee constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business by the Board of Directors or such committee.  A director interested in a contract or transaction may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or committee that authorizes the contract or transaction.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors or of a committee present may adjourn a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee until a quorum shall be present.
Quorum and Voting
Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of a conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with the other participants, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
The vote of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present constitutes the action of the Board of Directors or of a committee unless the vote of a greater number is required by the MBCA or, in the case of a committee, the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing the committee; provided, however, that amendment of the By-Laws by the Board requires the vote of not less than a majority of the directors then in office.
            Section 3.15.    .  Action required or permitted to be taken under authorization voted at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, all members of the Board of Directors then in office or of such committee, as the case may be, consent to the action in writing or by electronic transmission.  The consents shall be filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee and shall have the same effect as a vote of the Board of Directors or committee for all purposes.

The Board of Directors may delegate to the President the power to appoint designated officers.

An officer of the Corporation may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors with or without cause, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contracts rights, if any, of the officer so removed.  The election or appointment of any officer does not itself create contract rights.
Resignation and Removal of Officers

Any Vice President may have such additional designation in his or her title as the Board of Directors or the President may determine, which may reflect seniority, duties or responsibilities of such Vice President.  The Vice Presidents shall generally assist the President in such manner as the President shall direct.  Each Vice President shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President.
Vice President
Section 4.7.            .

The Secretary shall be empowered to affix the corporate seal to documents, the execution of which on behalf of the Corporation under its seal is duly authorized, and when so affixed may attest the same.  The Secretary shall have all powers and duties usually incident to the office of Secretary except as specifically limited by a resolution of the Board of Directors.  The Secretary shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President.

The applicant for any substituted certificate or for uncertificated shares shall surrender any mutilated certificate or, in the case of any lost or destroyed certificate, furnish satisfactory proof of such loss, theft or destruction of such certificate and of the ownership thereof.  The Board of Directors may, in its discretion, require the owner of a lost or destroyed certificate, or his or her representative, to furnish to the Corporation a bond with an acceptable surety or sureties and in such sum as will be sufficient to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of the lost or destroyed certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares in respect thereof.
Lost, Destroyed, Stolen and Mutilated Certificates
Section 5.8.            .  The Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of any meeting of shareholders, nor more than sixty days prior to any  other action, for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent or dissent from a proposal without a meeting, or to receive payment or any dividend or allotment of any rights or for the purpose of any other action.

Section 6.1.            .  The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and certain officers as designated by the Board of Directors from time to time to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law (as now or hereafter in effect) and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or designated officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or designated officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors.  The right to indemnification conferred by this Section 6.1 shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation, promptly as incurred, the reasonable expenses of defending or otherwise participating in any action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition upon receipt of a written undertaking executed by or on behalf of such director or designated officer to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he or she did not meet the standard of conduct, if any, required for the indemnification of a person under the circumstances.  The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to other officers, employees and agents of the Corporation.  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section 6.1 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under these By-Laws, the Articles of Incorporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.  Any repeal or modification of this Section 6.1 shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director or designated officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
Indemnification
Section 6.2.            .

Indemnification Insurance
Section 7.1.            .  The seal of the Corporation shall be circular in form with the name of the Corporation and the word Michigan in the circumference and the words "Corporate Seal - Kalamazoo" in the center.

Corporate Seal
Section 7.2.            .  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be from the 1st day of January to the 31st day of December, inclusive, in each year, or such other twelve consecutive months as the Board of Directors may designate.

When used in these By-Laws, the term "electronic transmission" shall include any telegram, cablegram, facsimile transmission, communication by electronic mail or other form of communication that does not directly involve the physical transmission of paper, creates a record that may be retained and retrieved by the recipient and may be directly reproduced in paper by the recipient through an automated process.
Electronic Transmission
Section 7.4.            .  When a notice is required or permitted to be given by these By-Laws in writing, electronic transmission is written notice.  When a notice or other communication is permitted by the MBCA to be transmitted electronically, the notice or other communication is given when electronically transmitted to the person entitled to the notice or communication in a manner authorized by such person.
Notices and Communications Generally
When a notice or communication is given by mail, it shall be mailed, except as otherwise provided in the MBCA, to the person to whom it is directed at the address designated by him or her for that purpose or, if none is designated, at his or her last known address.  The notice or communication is given when deposited, with postage thereon prepaid, in a post office or official depository under the exclusive care and custody of the United States postal service.  Notice and any other written report, statement or communication required to be given to shareholders shall be deemed to have been given to all shareholders of record who share an address if notice is given or such other report, statement or communication is delivered in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Exchange Act and in Section 143 of the MBCA.
When a notice or communication is required to be given to a person by the MBCA, the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws or otherwise and communication with the person is then unlawful under a statute of Michigan or the United States or a rule, regulation, proclamation or order issued under any such statute, the giving of the notice or communication to such person is not required and there is no duty to apply for a license or other permission to do so.

Exhibit 10.1
           
            Stryker Corporation has entered into an Indemnification Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2007, with each of the members of its board of directors: John W. Brown; Howard E. Cox, Jr.; Donald M. Engelman; Louise L. Francesconi; Jerome H. Grossman; Stephen P. MacMillan; William U. Parfet; and Ronda E. Stryker.  All such indemnification agreements are substantially identical in all material respects to the agreement attached hereto.
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), effective as of October 24, 2007, between Stryker Corporation, a Michigan corporation (the "Company"), and __________________ (the "Indemnitee").
WHEREAS, it is essential to the Company to retain and attract as directors the most capable persons available;
WHEREAS, Indemnitee is a director of the Company;
WHEREAS, both the Company and Indemnitee recognize the increased risk of litigation and other claims being asserted against directors of public companies in today's environment;
WHEREAS, the By-laws of the Company require the Company to indemnify and advance expenses to its directors to the full extent permitted by law and the Indemnitee has been serving and continues to serve as a director of the Company in part in reliance on such By-laws;
WHEREAS, in recognition of Indemnitee's need for substantial protection against personal liability in order to enhance Indemnitee's continued service to the Company in an effective manner, the increasing difficulty in obtaining satisfactory director and officer liability insurance coverage, and Indemnitee's reliance on the aforesaid By-laws, and in part to provide Indemnitee with specific contractual assurance that the protection promised by such By-laws will be available to Indemnitee (regardless of, among other things, any amendment to or revocation of such By-laws or any change in the composition of the Company's Board of Directors or acquisition transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancing of expenses to Indemnitee to the fullest extent (whether partial or complete) permitted by law and as set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent insurance is maintained, for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of Indemnitee continuing to serve the Company directly or, at its request, another enterprise, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.         :
Certain Definitions
(a)        : shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or a corporation owned directly or indirectly by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding Voting Securities, or (ii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors of the Company and any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, or (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the Voting Securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into Voting Securities of the surviving entity) at least 80% of the total voting power represented by the Voting Securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of (in one transaction or a series of transactions) all or substantially all the Company's assets.
Change in Control
(b)        :  any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company or any other party, that Indemnitee in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other and whether formal or informal.
Claim
(c)        :  include attorneys' fees and all other costs, expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim relating to any Indemnifiable Event.
Expenses
(d)        :  any event or occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, or by reason of anything done or not done by Indemnitee in any such capacity.
Indemnifiable Event
(e)        :  an attorney or firm of attorneys, selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 3, who shall not have otherwise performed services for the Company or Indemnitee within the last five years (other than with respect to matters concerning the rights of Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other indemnitees under similar indemnity agreements).
Independent Legal Counsel
(f)         :  any securities of the Company which vote generally in the election of directors.
Voting Securities
2.         .  In the event Indemnitee was, is or becomes a party to or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or arising in part out of) an Indemnifiable Event, the Company shall indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as soon as practicable but in any event no later than thirty days after written demand is presented to the Company, against any and all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) of such Claim.  If so requested by Indemnitee, the Company shall advance (within five business days of such request) any and all Expenses to Indemnitee (an "Expense Advance").  Indemnitee undertakes and agrees to repay such Expense Advances if and only to the extent that it shall ultimately be determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed) that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company under applicable law for the applicable Indemnifiable Event.  This undertaking to repay such Expense Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free and without regard to Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in Section 4 hereof, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee unless the Board of Directors has authorized or consented to the initiation of such Claim.
Basic Indemnification Arrangement
3.         .  The Company agrees that if there is a Change in Control of the Company (other than a Change in Control which has been approved by a majority of the Company's Board of Directors who were directors immediately prior to such Change in Control) then with respect to all matters thereafter arising concerning the rights of Indemnitee to indemnity payments and Expense Advances under this Agreement or any other agreement or Company By-law now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events, the Company shall seek legal advice only from Independent Legal Counsel selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  The Company agrees to pay the reasonable fees of the Independent Legal Counsel referred to above and to indemnify fully such counsel against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees), claims, liabilities and damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or its engagement pursuant hereto.
Change in Control
4.         .  The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within five business days of such request) advance such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for (i) indemnification or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under this Agreement or any other agreement or Company By-law now or hereafter in effect relating to Claims for Indemnifiable Events and/or (ii) recovery under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advance expense payment or insurance recovery, as the case may be.
Indemnification for Additional Expenses
5.           If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement of a Claim but not, however, for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.  Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith.
Partial Indemnity, Etc.
6.         .  In connection with any determination by the Company (including, without limitation, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, legal counsel or the stockholders) or otherwise as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that Indemnitee is not so entitled.
Burden of Proof
7.         .  For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.  In addition, neither the failure of the Company (including, without limitation, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, legal counsel or the stockholders) to have made a determination as to whether Indemnitee has met any particular standard of conduct or had any particular belief, nor an actual determination by the Company (including, without limitation, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, legal counsel or the stockholders) that Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct or did not have such belief, prior to the commencement of legal proceedings by Indemnitee to secure a judicial determination that Indemnitee should be indemnified under applicable law shall be a defense to Indemnitee's claim or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any particular standard of conduct or did not have any particular belief.
No Presumptions
8.           The rights of the Indemnitee hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Company's By-laws or the Michigan Business Corporation Act or otherwise.  To the extent that a change in the Michigan Business Corporation Act (whether by statute or judicial decision) permits greater indemnification by agreement than would be afforded currently under the Company's By-laws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change.
Nonexclusivity, Etc.
9.         .  To the extent the Company maintains an insurance policy or policies providing directors' and officers' liability insurance, Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies, in accordance with its or their terms, to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any Company director or officer.
Liability Insurance
10.       .  No legal action shall be brought and no cause of action shall be asserted by or in the right of the Company against Indemnitee, Indemnitee's spouse, heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives after the expiration of two years from the date of accrual of such cause of action, and any claim or cause of action of the Company shall be extinguished and deemed released unless asserted by the timely filing of a legal action within such two-year period; provided, however, that if any shorter period of limitations is otherwise applicable to any such cause of action such shorter period shall govern.
Period of Limitations
11.         No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by both of the parties hereto.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.
Amendments, Etc.
12.       .  In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the Company effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Subrogation
13.       .  The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with any Claim made against Indemnitee to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise actually received payment (under any insurance policy, By-law or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.
No Duplication of Payments
14.       .  The Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event or to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided that if Indemnitee believes, after consultation with counsel selected by Indemnitee, that (i) the use of counsel chosen by the Company to represent Indemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict of interest, (ii) the named parties in any such Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and Indemnitee and Indemnitee concludes that there may be one or more legal defenses available to him or her that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company, or (iii) any such representation by such counsel would be precluded under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any particular Claim) at the Company's expense.  The Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event effected without the Company's prior written consent.  The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any Claim relating to an Indemnifiable Event which the Indemnitee is or could have been a party unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee from all liability on all claims that are the subject matter of such Claim.  Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold its or his or her consent to any proposed settlement; that Indemnitee may withhold consent to any settlement that does not provide a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee.
Defense of Claims
provided
15.         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, spouses, heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.  This Agreement shall continue in effect regardless of whether Indemnitee continues to serve as a director of the Company or of any other enterprise at the Company's request.
Binding Effect, Etc.
16.       .  The provisions of this Agreement shall be severable in the event that any of the provisions hereof (including any provision within a single section, paragraph or sentence) are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable in any respect, and the validity and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Severability
17.       .  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan applicable to contracts made and to be performed in such state without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.
Governing Law
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement this day of October 24, 2007.
