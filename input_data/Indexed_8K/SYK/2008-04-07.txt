The Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation (the "Company") regrets to report that Jerome H. Grossman, M.D., a director since 1982, died unexpectedly on April 1, 2008.  Dr. Grossman, Senior Fellow and Director of the Harvard/Kennedy School Health Care Delivery Policy Program at John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lion Gate Management Corporation, was 68.
 
Dr. Grossman was a nominee for election to the Company's Board of Directors at the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 23, 2008 (the "2008 Annual Meeting").  Because of Dr. Grossman's unexpected death, the Board of Directors has reduced the size of the Company's Board of Directors from eight to seven.  The Board of Directors will therefore present only seven nominees for election to the Company's Board of Directors at the 2008 Annual Meeting.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
