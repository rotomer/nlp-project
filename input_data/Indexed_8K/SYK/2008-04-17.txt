Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on April 17, 2008 announcing its first quarter 2008 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007 which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations before the intangible asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amount. 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan - April 17, 2008-- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 as follows:
"We are pleased to report another strong quarter with double-digit sales growth and twenty percent growth in earnings from continuing operations," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "The ability to draw on a broad base of businesses continues to be important to our success, with six of our U.S. franchises - Spine, Trauma, Craniomaxillofacial, Instruments, Endoscopy and Medical - leading the way with 18% collective growth this quarter."
Net sales were $1,634.4 million for the first quarter of 2008, representing a 14.7% increase over net sales of $1,425.5 million for the first quarter of 2007. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 10.3% for the first quarter.
Net earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2008 were $290.5 million, representing a 20.1% increase over net earnings from continuing operations of $241.8 million for the first quarter of 2007.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2008 increased 20.7% to $.70 compared to $.58 for the first quarter of 2007.
 
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2008 were $290.5 million, representing a 19.3% increase over net earnings of $243.5 million for the first quarter of 2007.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008 increased 18.6% to $.70 compared to $.59 for the first quarter of 2007. 
Domestic sales were $1,032.9 million for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 13.1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.
International sales were $601.5 million for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 17.4%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $62.0 million in the first quarter of 2008.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 5.3% in the first quarter of 2008.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $971.1 million for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 12.4%, based on higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; and bone cement.  , sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 7.3% in the first quarter of 2008.
On a constant currency basis
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $663.3 million for the first quarter of 2008, representing an increase of 18.1%, based on higher shipments of surgical equipment; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 14.9% in the first quarter of 2008.
 
The Company's effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2008 was 28.1%, as compared to effective income tax rates on such earnings for the first quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.1% and 28.0%, respectively.
 
 
The Company's outlook for 2008 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth rates in the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for continued pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will approximate $2.88, an increase of 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 in 2007.  The financial forecast for 2008 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near March 31, 2008 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 4.5% to 5% in the second quarter of 2008 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year of 2008.
