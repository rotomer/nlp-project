Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on July 17, 2008 announcing its second quarter 2008 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2007 which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations before the intangible asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amount. 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The effective income tax rates for the second quarter, first half and year ended December 31, 2007 reflect the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit).
The Company's outlook for 2008 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth rates in the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for continued pricing pressure in certain markets.  The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will approximate $2.88, an increase of 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 in 2007.  The financial forecast for 2008 remains unchanged, with a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near June 30, 2008 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.5% to 3% in the third quarter of 2008 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 3% to 3.5% for the full year of 2008.
