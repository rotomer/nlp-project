Annual Meeting
 
            Section 2.2.            .  No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders other than business that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.2 and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.
Nature of Business at Meetings of Stockholder
            For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made.
            To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and as to the shareholder giving the notice and any "Shareholder Associated Person" (which for purposes of these By-Laws shall mean (a) any person acting in
 
concert, directly or indirectly, with such shareholder and (b) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such shareholder or any Shareholder Associated Person), (i) the name and record address of such person, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person, (iii) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (iv) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation, (v) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the proposal of business on the date of such shareholder's notice, (vi) a description of all arrangements or understandings between or among such persons in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest in such business and (vii) a representation that the shareholder giving the notice intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.  Any information required pursuant to this paragraph shall be supplemented by the shareholder giving the notice no later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting as of the record date.
            No business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders except for such business as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.  If the chairman of an annual or special meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
 
2.2 (including the provision of the information required pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph), the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.
            Section 2.3.            .  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors in certain circumstances.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at any annual meeting of shareholders, or at any special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, (a) at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any shareholder of the Corporation who (i) is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.3 and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3.
Nomination of Directors
            For a nomination to be made by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made; and (b) in the
 
case of a special meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of the special meeting was made.
            To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director and as to the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person (i) all information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (ii) the name and record address of such person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person, (iv) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (v) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate the loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation, (vi) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the nominee for election or reelection as a director on the date of such shareholder's notice, (vii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between or among such persons pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by the shareholder and any relationship between or among the shareholder giving notice and any
 
Shareholder Associated Person, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, on the other hand, and (viii) a representation that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice.  Any information required pursuant to this paragraph shall be supplemented by the shareholder giving the notice not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting as of the record date.  Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.  The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
            If the chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures (including the provision of the information required pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph), the chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.
            Section 2.4.            .  Special meetings of shareholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, by the President or by order of the Board of Directors.  Special meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place and on such date and at such time as shall be designated in the notice of meeting.
Special Meetings
            Section 2.5.            .  Written notice of each annual and special meeting of shareholders, stating the time, place and purposes thereof, shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of such meeting to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  Such notice may be given personally, by mail or by a form of electronic
Notice of Meetings
 
transmission to which the shareholder has consented.  If a shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at a meeting by remote communication, the means of remote communication allowed shall be included in the notice of the meeting.
            Section 2.6.            .  If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, shareholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of shareholders may participate in a meeting of shareholders by conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting may communicate with the other participants and shall be considered present in person and may vote at the meeting, whether such meeting is held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (a) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to verify that each person considered present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder or proxy holder; (b) the Corporation implements reasonable measures to provide each shareholder and proxy holder a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, (c) if any shareholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of the vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation and (d) all participants are advised of the means of remote communication and the names of the participants in the meeting are divulged to all participants.
Participation by Remote Communication
            Section 2.7.            .  The officer or agent who has charge of the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall make and certify a complete list, based upon the record date for a meeting of shareholders determined pursuant to Section 5.8 hereof, of the
List of Shareholders Entitled to Vote
 
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged alphabetically within each class and series, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder.  Such list shall be produced at the time and place of the meeting and may be inspected by any shareholder during the entire meeting.  If a meeting of shareholders is held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder during the entire meeting by posting the list on a reasonably accessible electronic network and the information required to access the list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
            Such list shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine the list or to vote in person or by proxy at the meeting.
            Section 2.8.            .  Any meeting of shareholders may be adjourned to another time or place, and the Corporation may transact at any adjourned meeting only business that could have been transacted at the original meeting unless notice of the adjourned meeting is given.  Notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting.  If notice of an adjourned meeting is given, such notice shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting in the manner prescribed in these By-Laws for the giving of notice of meetings.  A shareholder or proxy holder may be present and vote at the adjourned meeting by means of a remote communication if he or she was permitted to be present and vote by that means of remote communication in the original meeting notice.
Adjourned Meetings and Notice Thereof
            Section 2.9.            .  At any meeting of shareholders, except as otherwise provided in the MBCA, the holders of record of shares entitled to cast a majority of the votes at a meeting
Quorum
 
constitute a quorum at the meeting.  The shareholders present in person or by proxy at such meeting may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.  Whether or not a quorum is present, the meeting may be adjourned by a vote of the shares present.  When the holders of a class or series of shares are entitled to vote separately on an item of business, this Section 2.9 applies in determining the presence of a quorum of such class or series for transaction of the item of business.
            Section 2.10.        .  At any meeting of shareholders each outstanding share of stock having voting power shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to vote at such meeting, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation.  A vote may be cast either orally or in writing and otherwise as provided in these By-Laws.  If an action other than the election of directors is to be taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall be authorized by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote on the action, unless a greater vote is required by the MBCA.  Abstaining from a vote or submitting a ballot marked "abstain" with respect to an action is not a vote cast on that action.  Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election.
Voting; Proxies
            Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her by proxy.  Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for him or her as proxy, the following methods constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may grant authority to another person to act as proxy: (a) the execution of a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for the shareholder as proxy, which may be accomplished by the shareholder or by an authorized officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to
 
the writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, facsimile signature; and (b) transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will hold the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or similar agent fully authorized by the person who will hold the proxy to receive that transmission.  Any telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the shareholder.  If a telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission is determined to be valid, the inspectors of election, or, if there are no inspectors, the persons making the determination shall specify the information upon which they relied.  No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  The authority of the holder of a proxy to act is not revoked by the incompetence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless, before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of the incompetence or death is received by the officer or agent responsible for maintaining the list of shareholders.
            Section 2.11.        .  At each meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, the President or such other person designated by the Board of Directors shall preside and act as the chairman of the meeting.  The chairman shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority to establish rules for the conduct of the meeting, which may include, without limitation, the following:  (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iv) limitations
Conduct of Meetings
 
on attendance at or participation in the meeting to shareholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.
            Section 2.12.        .  The Corporation hereby elects not to be subject to the provisions of the Stacey, Bennett and Randall Shareholder Equity Act under the MBCA.
Control Share Acquisition Act

The exact number of directors that shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, from time to time change the number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors, provided, however, that in no event will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Number of Directors
            Section 3.3.            .  Directors need not be residents of the State of Michigan nor shareholders of the Corporation.
Qualification

            Section 3.5.            .  Each director shall hold office until the succeeding annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal.
Term
            Section 3.6.            .  Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Corporation.  The resignation of any director shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at a later time specified in such notice.  Any director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Resignation and Removal
            Section 3.7.            .  Vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by the shareholders or by the Board of Directors.  If the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum, they may fill vacancies by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.
Vacancies
            Section 3.8.            .  The Board of Directors may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the business and management of the Corporation that are not inconsistent with the MBCA or the Articles of Incorporation or these By-Laws as the Board of Directors may deem proper.
Regulations
            Section 3.9.            .

            Section 3.10.          .  Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the time and place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors.  After there has been such determination and notice thereof has been given to each member of the Board of Directors, no further notice shall be required for any such regular meeting.
Regular Meetings
            Section 3.11.          .  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called from time to time by the Chairman of the Board or the President and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary upon the written request of a majority of the whole Board of Directors directed to the Chairman of the Board or the Secretary.  Notice of any special meeting of the Board of Directors, stating the time and place of such special meeting, shall be given to each director.  Such notice shall be given personally, by telephone, by overnight courier or by a form of electronic transmission not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the meeting (or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances).
Special Meetings
            Section 3.12.          .  The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.  Each committee and each member thereof shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
Committees of Directors
            Section 3.13.          .  Any committee, to the extent provided in the resolution or resolutions creating such committee, shall have and may exercise
Powers and Duties of Committees
 
all powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, subject to any limitation by the MBCA or these By-Laws.  No such committee shall have the power or authority with regard to amending the Articles of Incorporation (except that a committee may prescribe the relative rights and preferences of the shares of series of preferred stock permitted to be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation), adopting an agreement of merger or share exchange, recommending to the shareholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to the shareholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, amending these By-Laws or filling vacancies on the Board of Directors or fixing compensation of the directors for serving on the Board of Directors or on a committee thereof and, unless a resolution of the Board of Directors so provides, declaring a distribution or dividend or authorizing the issuance of shares.
            Each committee may adopt its own rules of procedure and may meet at stated times or on such notice as such committee may determine and, unless otherwise provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors, may designate one or more subcommittees, each of which shall consist of one or more members, to which all or part of the power and authority of the committee may be delegated.  Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors.
            Section 3.14.          .   A majority of the members of the Board of Directors then in office and, unless the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing the committee provides otherwise, of the members of a committee constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business by the Board of Directors or such committee.  A director interested in a contract or transaction may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of
Quorum and Voting
 
the Board of Directors or committee that authorizes the contract or transaction.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors or of a committee present may adjourn a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee until a quorum shall be present.
            Members of the Board of Directors or any committee designated by the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of a conference telephone or other means of remote communication through which all persons participating in the meeting can communicate with the other participants, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
            The vote of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present constitutes the action of the Board of Directors or of a committee unless the vote of a greater number is required by the MBCA or, in the case of a committee, the resolution of the Board of Directors establishing the committee; provided, however, that amendment of the By-Laws by the Board requires the vote of not less than a majority of the directors then in office.
            Section 3.15.          .  Action required or permitted to be taken under authorization voted at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, all members of the Board of Directors then in office or of such committee, as the case may be, consent to the action in writing or by electronic transmission.  The consents shall be filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such committee and shall have the same effect as a vote of the Board of Directors or committee for all purposes.
Action Without Meeting
            Section 4.1.            .  The officers of the Corporation shall include a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer and may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, also include a
Officers
 
Chairman of the Board, one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Treasurers and Assistant Secretaries and such other officers as may be determined pursuant to Section 4.2.  None of the officers, except the Chairman of the Board, if any, need be a director of the Corporation.
            Section 4.2.            .  Officers of the Corporation shall be elected annually by the Board of Directors at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.  If any vacancy in any office shall occur or any office shall be newly created, such office may be filled by the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors may delegate to the President the power to appoint designated officers.  Each officer shall hold office for the term for which he or she is elected or appointed or until his or her successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal.

The resignation of any officer shall take effect upon receipt by the Corporation of notice thereof or at a later time specified in such notice.  An officer of the Corporation may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors with or without cause, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contracts rights, if any, of the officer so removed.  The election or appointment of any officer does not itself create contract rights.
Resignation and Removal of Officers
            Section 4.4.            .  The Chairman of the Board, who may be an officer of the Corporation or may be a non-executive Chairman of the Board as determined by the Board of Directors, shall preside at all meetings of shareholders and of the Board of Directors at which he or she is present.
