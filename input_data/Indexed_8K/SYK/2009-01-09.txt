Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on January 9, 2009 updating its expected 2008 results and 2009 outlook.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted diluted net earnings per share" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charge to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2007, both of which affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.
 
The reconciliation of projected reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share before the restructuring charge for the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows:
 
 
The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations before the intangible asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2007 is as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amount.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The financial forecast for 2009 includes a constant currency net sales increase of 6% to 9% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates net sales will be unfavorably impacted by approximately 4% to 5% in the first quarter of 2009 and by approximately 3% to 4% for the full year of 2009.
"In a challenging economic environment, we are pleased to report our eighth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth for 2008," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Although our fourth quarter was impacted by reduced capital purchases by the Company's hospital customers, our diversified business model helped deliver another strong year of growth.  Despite great uncertainty in the global economy and continued pressure on hospital capital expenditure budgets, we believe the strength of our global franchises combined with our focus on cost controls will allow us to deliver solid top line growth and double-digit EPS gains in 2009."
