Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on January 27, 2009 announcing its fourth quarter and year end 2008 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings from continuing operations" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
"We are pleased to report our eighth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth for 2008 despite the slowdown in capital purchases by our hospital customers during the fourth quarter," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Six of our eight major product franchises achieved double-digit sales growth in 2008 demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model.  As a result, we were able to deliver 18% adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations growth in a year that included significant internal and external challenges."
 
Net sales increased 3.6% to $1,718 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, and increased 12.0% to $6,718 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter and 10.5% for the year.
 
Net earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by $22 million of restructuring charges (net of income tax benefits) related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company's Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the 2006 acquisition of Sightline Technologies, Ltd.  Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were reduced by a $13 million intangible asset impairment charge (net of income tax benefit).
 
Excluding the impact of the 2008 restructuring charges, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $299 million increased 8.4% over net earnings from continuing operations of $276 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $0.74 increased 12.1% over diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.66 for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Excluding the impacts of the 2008 restructuring charges and the 2007 intangible asset impairment charge, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $1,170 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 17.0% over adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $999 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $2.83 increased 17.9% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
Net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $278 million, representing a 0.6% increase over net earnings of $276 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Diluted net earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 4.5% to $0.69 compared to $0.66 for the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a gain of $26 million (net of income taxes) to reflect the divestiture of the Company's outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $5 million.
 
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1,148 million, representing a 12.8% increase over net earnings of $1,017 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 13.9% to $2.78 compared to $2.44 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
 
Domestic sales increased 7.0% in the fourth quarter and 11.2% for the year. International sales decreased 2.3% in the fourth quarter and increased 13.3% for the year. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $68 million in the fourth quarter and favorable by $85 million for the year.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9.0% in the fourth quarter and 9.4% for the year.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 4.2% in the fourth quarter and 10.6% for the year, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 8.9% in the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the year.

Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 14.0% for the year. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the year.
 
The Company's effective income tax rates on earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 were 26.9% and 27.4%, respectively, as compared to effective income tax rates on such earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.1% and 28.0%, respectively.  The effective income tax rates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 reflect the impact of the restructuring charges of $22 million (net of $13 million income tax benefits).  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $13 million (net of $7 million income tax benefit).
 
The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of $3.12 to $3.22, an increase of 10% to 14% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.83 in 2008.  The financial forecast for 2009 anticipates a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 6% to 9%.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 4.5% to 5.5% in the first quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year of 2009.
