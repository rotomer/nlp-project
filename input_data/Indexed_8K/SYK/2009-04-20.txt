            Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on April 20, 2009 announcing its first quarter 2009 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
            In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 which affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Kalamazoo, Michigan - April 20, 2009-- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 as follows:
"The unprecedented global economic slowdown clearly impacted our business, yet our diverse set of businesses still delivered underlying sales growth in this very challenging period as six of our eight key product franchises delivered mid-single to low double-digit constant currency revenue growth," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Net sales were $1,601 million for the first quarter of 2009, representing a 2.0% decrease compared to net sales of $1,634 million for the first quarter of 2008. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 3.3% for the first quarter.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2009 were $281 million, representing a 3.2% decrease compared to net earnings of $291 million for the first quarter of 2008.  Diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2009 increased 1.4% to $0.71 compared to $0.70 for the first quarter of 2008.
 
Domestic sales were $1,042 million for the first quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 0.9%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg Equipment.
International sales were $559 million for the first quarter of 2009, representing a decrease of 7.0%.  The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $87 million in the first quarter of 2009.  On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 7.4% in the first quarter of 2009, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $973 million for the first quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 0.2%.  , sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6.2% in the first quarter of 2009, based on higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems.
On a constant currency basis
Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $628 million for the first quarter of 2009, representing a decrease of 5.3%.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 1.0% in the first quarter of 2009, as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems and patient handling and emergency medical equipment.
 
The Company's effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2009 was 27.3%, as compared to effective income tax rates for the first quarter of 2008 and year ended December 31, 2008 of 28.1% and 27.4%, respectively.
In April 2009 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued two notices of proposed tax adjustments to the Company's previously filed 2003, 2004 and 2005 income tax returns related to income tax positions the Company has taken for its cost sharing arrangements with two wholly owned entities operating in Ireland.  The Company believes it followed the applicable tax law and Treasury regulations and will vigorously defend these income tax positions. If the IRS were ultimately to prevail with respect to its proposed tax adjustments, such adjustments could have a material unfavorable impact on the Company's income tax expense and net earnings in future periods.
 
As a result of the continued weaker demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products as well as consideration of slowing elective procedures for certain Orthopaedic Implant products, the Company is reducing its guidance for 2009.
The Company now projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of $2.90 to $3.10, an increase of 2% to 10% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.83 in 2008.  The financial forecast for 2009 anticipates a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 2% to 5%.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near March 31, 2009 levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 5.5% to 6.0% in the second quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year of 2009.
