            Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on October 20, 2009 announcing its third quarter 2009 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
            In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency," "adjusted net earnings" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows:
 
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Kalamazoo, Michigan - October 20, 2009- Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 as follows:
 
"We are pleased to deliver solid results in a challenging environment with all of our orthopaedic implant businesses posting accelerated worldwide revenue growth, led by strong performances in the U.S. In addition, both our Endoscopy and Medical franchises showed a modest rebound with sequentially higher sales over the second quarter of 2009 despite continued softness in hospital spending," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
Net sales were $1,653 million in both the third quarter of 2009 and the third quarter of 2008. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1.2% for the third quarter.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were reduced by $48 million of restructuring charges (net of income tax benefits) related to decisions to terminate certain third-party agent agreements at the Company's EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products.
 
Excluding the impact of the 2009 restructuring charges, adjusted net earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $277 million, representing a 1.3% increase compared to net earnings of $274 million for the third quarter of 2008.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 were $0.69, representing a 4.5% increase compared to $0.66 for the third quarter of 2008.
 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2009 were $229 million, representing a 16.4% decrease compared to net earnings of $274 million for the third quarter of 2008.  Diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 were $0.57, representing a 13.6% decrease compared to $0.66 for the third quarter of 2008. 
 
Domestic sales were $1,070 million for the third quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 0.2%, as a 7.9% increase in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants was partially offset by an 8.3% decrease in shipments of MedSurg Equipment.
 
International sales were $584 million for the third quarter of 2009, representing a decrease of 0.3%. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 3.1% in the third quarter of 2009, as a result of a 5.5% increase in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by a 2.3% decrease in shipments of MedSurg Equipment.
 
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,017 million for the third quarter of 2009, representing an increase of 5.5% as reported and 6.9% on a constant currency basis. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $637 million for the third quarter of 2009, representing a decrease of 7.7% as reported and 6.7% on a constant currency basis.
 
The Company projects that adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of $2.90 to $3.00, an increase of 2% to 6% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.83 in 2008.  The financial forecast for 2009 anticipates a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 1.0% to 2.0%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near September 30, 2009 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 3.2% to 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1.6% to 2.0% for the full year of 2009.
