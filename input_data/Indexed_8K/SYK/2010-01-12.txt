Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on January 12, 2010 updating its expected 2009 results and 2010 outlook.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009 and the gain recorded pursuant to a confidential patent infringement settlement agreement recorded in 2009, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.
The reconciliation of projected reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows:
The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 is as follows:
 
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure are the same as the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan - January 12, 2010 - Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) announced today that net sales were $1,834 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, representing a 6.8% increase over net sales of $1,718 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and were $6,723 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a 0.1% increase from net sales of $6,718 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% for the fourth quarter and 1.7% for the year.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement and will record a gain of $63 million ($43 million net of income taxes).  In addition, the Company repatriated $787 million of foreign earnings to the United States and will incur additional income tax expense of approximately $70 million.  The repatriated cash was used to fund the acquisition of Ascent Heathcare and will also be used for previously announced initiatives including the share repurchase authorization.
Stryker expects 2009 diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.78 compared to diluted net earnings per share of $2.78 in 2008. Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain, the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, and previously announced restructuring charges, adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2009 are expected to be in the range of $2.94 to $2.96, an increase of 4% to 5% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.83 in 2008.
2009 Sales Analysis
Domestic sales were $1,159 million for the fourth quarter and $4,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing increases of 2.7% and 0.8%, respectively. International sales were $676 million for the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 14.6% and were $2,406 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, representing a decrease of 1.2%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $73 million in the fourth quarter and unfavorable by $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 2.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009.

2010 Outlook
The financial forecast for 2010 includes a constant currency net sales increase of 5% to 8% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 4% to 5% in the first quarter of 2010 and by approximately 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year of 2010. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2010 will be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30, an increase of 8% to 12% over expected adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.94 to $2.96 in 2009.
"It was nice to end the year on a stronger note. We are particularly pleased that in a challenging year, our U.S. orthopaedic implant businesses performed well. Additionally, we are feeling better as we enter 2010 that our MedSurg franchises have stabilized and are showing signs of a modest recovery," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
