Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on January 10, 2011 updating its expected 2010 results and 2011 outlook.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes acquisition and integration-related charges to be recorded in 2011, the gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009, the impairment of certain property, plant and equipment recorded in 2010, restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and the gain recorded pursuant to a confidential patent infringement settlement agreement recorded in 2009, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.  The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share is included in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan - January 10, 2011 - Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) announced today that net sales were $1,995 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, representing an 8.8% increase over net sales of $1,834 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, and were $7,320 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing an 8.9% increase over net sales of $6,723 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 8.6% for the fourth quarter. For the year, constant currency sales growth of 7.8% falls within the previously communicated 7% to 8% constant currency sales range and is at the high end of the initial 5% to 8% sales guidance.
Stryker expects 2010 diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.19 compared to diluted net earnings per share of $2.77 in 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company will record a charge of approximately $125 million ($77 million net of income taxes) to reflect the anticipated loss on the previously announced sale of OP-1 assets used in orthopaedic bone applications.
Excluding the impact of the 2010 OP-1 assets charge and other previously reported adjusting items, adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2010 are expected to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.33, above the previously communicated $3.27 to $3.30 range. This will represent an increase of 12.2% to 12.9% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.95 in 2009.  A reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share has been included at the end of this press release.
During the fourth quarter, Stryker repurchased 6.1 million shares at a cost of $314 million bringing total 2010 share repurchases to 8.3 million shares at a cost of $426 million.
"Despite ongoing economic uncertainty and a slowdown in elective surgeries, we delivered sales growth at the high end of the range established at the start of 2010. Additionally, we achieved earnings growth above the high end of the stated range while making significant investments in our quality and compliance systems, as well as sales, marketing and R&D," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We took a number of important steps to reshape our company and enhance our competitive position by executing on several strategic acquisitions that are strengthening our core product offerings while also allowing us to further diversify our sales footprint in some of the highest growth segments in medical technology. And with the sale of the OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications, we refocused our biologic R&D activities. Finally, we utilized our exceptional cash flow generation to further enhance shareholder return with a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend coupled with ongoing share repurchases."
2010 Sales Analysis
Domestic sales were $1,286 million for the fourth quarter and $4,793 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing increases of 11.0% in both the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. International sales were $710 million for the fourth quarter and were $2,527 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing increases of 5.0% and 5.1%, respectively. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $2 million in the fourth quarter and favorable by $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 4.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,166 million for the fourth quarter and $4,308 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing increases of 4.5% and 4.6%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $829 million for the fourth quarter representing an increase of 15.3% and were $3,012 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, representing an increase of 15.7%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 15.4% in the fourth quarter and 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
2011 Outlook
The financial forecast for 2011 includes a constant currency sales increase of 11-13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment as well as sales from the recently acquired Neurovascular business. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 0% to 1.0% in the first quarter of 2011 and by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2011. Excluding the expected impact from foreign currency as well as acquisitions (Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator, Gaymar Industries, Porex Surgical and the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific), projected sales growth is 5-7%.
The Company projects that adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2011 will be in the range of $3.65 to $3.73, an increase of 10% to 13% over expected adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.31 to $3.33 in 2010. In 2011, the Company anticipates acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the recently completed acquisition of the Neurovascular business to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.21 to $0.25, including transaction costs, additional costs associated with the step-up of inventory to fair value and other integration costs.
"We believe our results for 2010 and our financial forecast for 2011 underscore the strength of our unique sales footprint that is driving superior results in the near term while investing in critical growth areas for the long term," commented Stephen P. MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
