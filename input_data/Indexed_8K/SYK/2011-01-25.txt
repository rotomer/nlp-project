Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on January 25, 2011 announcing its fourth quarter and year end 2010 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes acquisition and integration-related charges to be recorded in 2011, the gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009, the impairment of certain property, plant and equipment recorded in 2010, restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and the gain recorded pursuant to a confidential patent infringement settlement agreement recorded in 2009, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.
 
The reconciliation of projected reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:
 
 
The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is included in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Kalamazoo, Michigan - January 25, 2011 - Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 as follows:
"Our 2010 results reinforce the underlying strength provided by our diverse revenue base as we delivered on our financial commitments while successfully navigating through the continued challenges presented by the difficult economic environment," said Stephen P. MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "In 2010 we augmented our unique sales footprint by leveraging our balance sheet through several key acquisitions that both strengthen our core product offering while also allowing us to expand into fast growing adjacent medical technology markets. Combined with the continued double-digit increase in our annual dividend and ongoing share repurchases, we believe these moves optimized shareholder return and position our company for long term growth."

2011 Outlook
The financial forecast for 2011 includes a constant currency sales increase of 11-13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment as well as sales from the recently acquired Neurovascular business. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near year-end levels, the Company anticipates net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 0% to 1.0% in the first quarter of 2011 and by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2011. Excluding the expected impact from foreign currency as well as acquisitions, sales growth is projected to be 5-7%.
The Company projects that adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2011 will be in the range of $3.65 to $3.73, an increase of 10% to 12% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.33 in 2010. In 2011, the Company anticipates acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the recently completed acquisition of the Neurovascular business to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.21 to $0.25, including transaction costs, additional costs associated with the step-up of inventory to fair value and other integration costs.
