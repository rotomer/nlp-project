SECTION 5 - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Item 5.02      Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) On February 8, 2011, Donald M. Engelman, Ph.D. notified the Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation (the "Company") that he will retire as a Director of the Company, effective April 26, 2011 and, therefore, will not stand for re-election to the Company's Board of Directors at its Annual Shareholders' meeting to be held on April 26, 2011.
(e) The Company has historically granted stock options to key employees and, since 2009, has granted restricted stock units as well as stock options to certain key employees under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  On February 9, 2011, performance stock units (PSUs) were included for the first time in the equity awards to certain key employees under the Plan. The 2011 awards to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and named executive officers under the Plan are as follows:
 
The stock options have an exercise price of $59.70 per share, the closing sales price as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions for the day before the grant, will become exercisable 20% per year beginning on February 9, 2012 and will expire on February 8, 2021.  The vesting of the PSUs is dependent upon the Company's financial performance during the three-year period ending December 31, 2013, with the vesting of 50% of the PSUs being based on the level of achievement of pre-established three-year average adjusted earnings per share goals and the vesting of the remaining 50% of the PSUs being based on the Company's three-year average sales growth performance relative to a comparison group of companies.  As a general rule, the vesting of the performance share units is also dependent upon the recipient remaining continuously employed with the Company through the vesting date, March 21, 2014.
