Stryker Corporation (the Company) issued a press release on April 19, 2011 announcing its first quarter 2011 operating results.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
            
In its press release, the Company made references to the following financial measures:  "constant currency" and "adjusted diluted net earnings per share."  These financial measures are an alternative representation of the Company's past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.  Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales.  Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates.  In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes acquisition and integration-related charges recorded in 2011, the impairment of property, plant and equipment and gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009, restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and the gain recorded pursuant to a confidential patent infringement settlement agreement recorded in 2009, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings.  In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results.  The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.
 
The reconciliation of projected reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2011 is as follows:
 
 
The reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 is included in the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Sales Analysis

Net sales grew by 6.2% as a result of acquisitions, 5.9% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.8% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.9% due to changes in price.
 
Worldwide sales of Reconstructive products were $911 million for the first quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 1.9%.  , sales of Reconstructive products decreased 0.2% in the first quarter of 2011, as higher shipments of hip and trauma and extremities implant systems were offset by lower shipments of knee and other implant systems.
On a constant currency basis
 
Worldwide sales of MedSurg products were $764 million for the first quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 13.1%.  On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg products increased 11.9% in the first quarter of 2011, based on higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems and patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as sales growth through acquisitions.  Sales of MedSurg products in the first quarter of 2010 were positively impacted by 2.6% from a one-time shipment of patient handling equipment.  Excluding this shipment and the impact of acquisitions, worldwide sales of MedSurg products increased 12.4% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Worldwide sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products were $340 million for the first quarter of 2011, representing an increase of 48.3%.

Earnings Analysis
 
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2011 included acquisition and integration-related charges of $46 million (net of income tax benefits) as a result of the acquisition of the Neurovascular business. These charges included transaction, integration-related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the first quarter that was stepped up to fair value. These charges reduced the reported gross profit margin from 68.5% to 65.8% and the reported operating income margin from 24.3% to 21.0%.
 
Excluding the impacts of the acquisition and integration-related charges, adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of 2011 of $353 million increased 9.9% over net earnings of $322 million for the first quarter of 2010.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2011 of $0.90 increased 12.5% over diluted net earnings per share of $0.80 for the first quarter of 2010.

2011 Outlook
 
The financial forecast for 2011 includes a constant currency net sales increase of 11-13% as a result of growth in shipments of Reconstructive products, MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products as well as sales growth through acquisitions.  If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 3-4% in the second quarter of 2011 and by approximately 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year of 2011.  Excluding the expected impact from foreign currency as well as acquisitions, sales growth is projected to be 5-7% for the full year of 2011.
 
The Company projects that adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2011 will be in the range of $3.65 to $3.73, an increase of 10% to 12% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.33 in 2010.  In 2011, the Company anticipates acquisition and integration-related charges of approximately $0.28 to $0.30 per share (net of income tax benefits), including transaction costs, integration-related charges and additional cost of sales for inventory sold that was stepped-up to fair value, as a result of the acquisition of the Neurovascular business. This is an increase from the previously communicated range of $0.21 to $0.25 as a result of a higher fair value step-up to inventory identified as part of the valuation.
