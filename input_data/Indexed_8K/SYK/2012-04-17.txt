STRYKER REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Kalamazoo, Michigan - April 17, 2012 - Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the first quarter of 2012:
Quarter Highlights
Our dedicated employees continue to execute on the strategy we have been pursuing. The 7% revenue and 10% adjusted per share earnings growth reflect the momentum we are seeing on both a product and geographic level and have us on track to deliver on our financial commitments, " commented Curt R. Hartman, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are committed to growing our diverse mix of businesses and global market presence. Our focus remains on internally driven innovation, strategic acquisitions and our ongoing commitment to both quality and operating efficiencies while optimizing capital allocation through share buybacks and dividends.
Sales Analysis
Consolidated net sales of $2.2 billion increased 7.2% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 7.4% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 6.9% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 2.3% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.7% due to changes in price and 0.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 5.2% in constant currency over the prior year.
Reconstructive net sales of $958 million increased 5.2% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 5.2% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 6.1% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.8% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 2.6% due to changes in price. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Reconstructive net sales increased 3.4% in constant currency over the prior year.
MedSurg net sales of $821 million increased 7.5% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 7.9% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 8.2% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.3% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 0.5% due to changes in
price and 0.4% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, MedSurg net sales increased 7.6% in constant currency over the prior year.
Neurotechnology and Spine products net sales of $382 million increased 12.4% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 12.3% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 6.2% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 8.0% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 2.0% due to changes in price. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Neurotechnology and Spine net sales increased 4.3% in constant currency over the prior year.
Earnings Analysis
Reported net earnings in the quarter includes restructuring and related charges of $12 million (net of taxes), and acquisition and integration related charges of $17 million (net of taxes) related to the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric acquisitions, including integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the quarter that was stepped up to fair value. These charges reduced reported gross profit margin from 67.8% to 67.2% and reported operating income margin from 23.7% to 22.0%.
Excluding the impacts of restructuring and related charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, adjusted net earnings
(2)
of $379 million increased 7.4% in the quarter over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share
(1)
of $0.99 increased 10.0% in the quarter over the prior year.
Net earnings of $350 million increased 14.0% in the quarter over the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share of $0.91 increased 16.7% in the quarter over the prior year.
During the quarter, Stryker repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of $50 million.
2012 Outlook
The financial forecast for 2012 includes a constant currency sales increase of 3.5% to 6.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be impacted negatively by approximately 1.0% to 2.0% in the second quarter of 2012 and negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2012. Excluding the expected impact of foreign currency and acquisitions, projected sales growth is 2% to 5%.
We project 2012 adjusted diluted net earnings per share
(1)
to grow at double-digit levels over 2011. In 2012, we anticipate previously announced restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration-related charges to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.22.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments, and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share:
