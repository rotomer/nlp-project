Section 2.17
, risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans and L/C Obligations) to be held ratably by all Lenders in accordance with their respective revised Applicable Percentage, (ii) the Borrowers shall be deemed to have prepaid and reborrowed the outstanding Committed Loans as of such Increase Effective Date to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section and (iii) the Company shall pay to the relevant Lenders the amounts, if any, required pursuant to

Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit

Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company or a Designated Borrower
delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof (either Dollars or a Letter of Credit and Swing Line Offshore Currency); (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the account party (either the Company or a Designated Borrower) for whom such Letter of Credit shall be issued; and (H) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Part II of
Schedule
32
1.01(C)
summarizes the protocols for the issuance and amendment of Letters of Credit.
(ii)
    
Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Company or a Designated Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer may provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the applicable L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender or the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in
Article IV
shall not then be satisfied, upon receipt by the applicable L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted under
Section 2.04(a)(i)
in terms of any additional L/C Obligations created thereby, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Company or a Designated Borrower, as applicable, or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuers usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lenders Applicable Percentage
times
the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(iii)
    
If the Company or a Designated Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an 
Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit
);
provided
that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the applicable L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the 
Nonrenewal Notice Date
) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Company or such Designated Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the applicable L/C Issuer for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided
,
however
, that the applicable L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof, or (B) it has received notice on or before the day that is two Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 4.02
is not then satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no L/C Issuer shall have any obligation to permit the renewal of any Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit at any time, and in no event shall the expiry date of any Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit after any renewal as described herein occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.
(iv)
    
Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
33
(c)
    
Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations
.
(i)
    
Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company, the applicable Designated Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and of the anticipated date of payment by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit (each such actual date of payment, an 
Honor Date
). In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Offshore Currency, the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be, shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any drawing thereunder in such Offshore Currency, unless such L/C Issuer (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Offshore Currency, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be, of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. The Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be, shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency not later than (A) in the event notice of the Honor Date has been given to the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be, at least one Business Day in advance of such Honor Date, 12:00 noon (Applicable Time, in the case of a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Offshore Currency), or (B) in any other event, 12:00 noon (Applicable Time, in the case of a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Offshore Currency) on the Business Day following the Honor Date. If the Company or such Designated Borrower fails to so reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the 
Unreimbursed Amount
), and the amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage thereof and, in accordance with the following sentence, whether a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans will be made to repay the Unreimbursed Amount or whether, pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(iii)
, an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount shall be deemed incurred by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower and that each Lender shall participate in such L/C Borrowing in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. In such event, the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.02 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with (x) to the extent such Unreimbursed Amount is in Dollars, a Base Rate Loan or Swing Line Loan in Dollars in an amount equal to such Unreimbursed Amount or (y) to the extent such Unreimbursed Amount is in an Offshore Currency, an Offshore Rate Loan in such Offshore Currency in an amount equal to such Unreimbursed Amount and, in each case, to the extent so financed, the Companys or the applicable Designated Borrowers, as the case may be, obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Base Rate Loan, Offshore Rate Loan or Swing Line Loan, as applicable. Any notice given by the applicable L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.04(c)(i)
shall have the same force and effect as if made by the Company or a Designated Borrower, and may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;
provided
that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(ii)
    
Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(i)
make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, in the currency of the applicable Letter of Credit, at the Administrative Agents Office for payments in such currency in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse any L/C Issuer for any Unreimbursed Amount (other than the funding of Base Rate Loans, Offshore
34
Rate Loans or a Swing Line Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Committed Loan and shall not relieve the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be, of its obligation to reimburse such Unreimbursed Amount.
(iii)
    
With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing because the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(ii)
shall be deemed payment in respect of its risk participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its risk participation obligation in such L/C Borrowing under this
Section 2.04
.
(iv)
    
Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.04(c)
to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any Unreimbursed Amount drawn under any Letter of Credit or to fund its participation therein, as the case may be, interest in respect of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such L/C Issuer.
(v)
    
Each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
Section 2.04(c)
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, the Company, any Designated Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.04(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(other than delivery by the Company or any Designated Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). Any such reimbursement with the proceeds of Committed Loans or L/C Advances shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(i)
    
If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.04(c)
by the time specified in
Section 2.04(c)(ii)
, then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. A certificate of the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d)
    
Repayment of Participations
.
(i)
    
At any time after the applicable L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter
35
of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lenders L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)
, if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Company, the applicable Designated Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender the amount of its Applicable Percentage thereof.
(ii)
    
If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(i)
in respect of any drawing on any Letter of Credit is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
Section 10.05
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer the amount of its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, and such payment by each Lender shall be deemed to be its L/C Advance in such amount pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)(iii)
. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e)
    
Obligations Absolute
.
The obligation of the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit, and to repay each L/C Borrowing, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
(i)
    
any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

(iii)
    
any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
(iv)
    
any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by such L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;
(v)
    
any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Letter of Credit and Swing Line Offshore Currency to the Company or any Designated Borrower
36
or in the relevant currency markets generally; or
(vi)
    
any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Company or a Designated Borrower, as the case may be.
The Company or the applicable Designated Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Companys or such Designated Borrowers instructions or other irregularity, the Company or such Designated Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer. The Company or the applicable Designated Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

None of the applicable L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the applicable L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Company and each Designated Borrower hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the applicable L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such L/C Issuer shall not be responsible (a) for accepting documents that appear on their face to be in order except to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company or a Designated Borrower, as the case may be, which the Company or such Designated Borrower, as applicable, proves were caused by such L/C Issuers gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining that any such document appears on its face to be in order or (b) for the validity or sufficiency
37
of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

If such Swing Line Loan is outstanding in a currency described in clause (i) of the definition of Committed Loan Offshore Currency, then such Committed Loan shall be an Offshore Currency Committed Loan in such currency in an amount equal to such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swing Line Loan. If such Swing Line Loan is outstanding in Dollars or a currency that is not described in clause (i) of the definition of Committed Loan Offshore Currency, then such Committed Loan shall be a Base Rate Committed Loan in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent Amount of such Lenders Applicable Percentage of such Swing Line Loan.

(iv)
    
If for any reason any Committed Borrowing cannot be requested in accordance with
Section 2.05(c)(i)
or any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Committed Borrowing, the Committed Loan Notice submitted by the Swing Line Lender shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the amount and currency of the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lenders payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to
Section 2.05(c)(i)
shall be deemed payment in respect of such risk participation in the amount of such Swing Line Loan.
(v)
    
If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.05(c)
by the time specified in
Section 2.05(c)(i)

provided
,
however
, that each Lenders obligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.05(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
. Any such purchase of risk participations by each Lender from the Swing Line Lender shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

Repayment of Participations
.
(vii)

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Offshore Currency, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 12:00 noon on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Offshore Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agents Office in such Offshore Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than 12:00 noon, Applicable Time, on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Offshore Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent Amount of the Offshore Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lenders Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 12:00 noon in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after 12:00 noon, Applicable Time, in the case of payments in an Offshore Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall in each case continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b)
    
(i)     
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Offshore Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lenders share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02
(or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02
) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (or, in the case of a Borrower only, one Business Day following demand) such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lenders Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim
47
such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii)
    
Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be presumptively correct, absent manifest error.
(c)
    
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to any Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to such Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article IV
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)
    
Obligations of Lenders Several
. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to
Section 10.04(c)
are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c)
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under
Section 10.04(c)
.
(e)
    
Funding Source
. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
Sharing of Payments
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lenders receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its
pro
rata
share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them;
provided
that:
(a)
    
if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the
48
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(b)
    
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by a Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in
Section 2.16
or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower, subject to
Section 10.08
, rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Designated Borrowers
.
(a)
    
Effective as of the date hereof, each of Stryker IFSC Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Ireland, Howmedica International S. de R.L., a limited liability company (
sociedad de responsabilidad limitada

(b)
    
The Company may at any time, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent, designate any additional
Subsidiary of the Company (an 
Applicant Borrower
) as a Designated Borrower to request and be advanced Committed Loans
and Swing Line Loans hereunder and to apply for Letters of Credit to be issued hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver counterparts thereof to each Lender) a duly executed notice and agreement in substantially the form of
Exhibit H
(a 
Designated Borrower Notice and Assumption Agreement
). Following receipt of such notice from the Company, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of such notice. Within 5 Business Days of its receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent, each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent if it would be unlawful for such Lender to permit such Applicant Borrower to request and be advanced Committed Loans
and Swing Line Loans from such Lender hereunder and to apply for Letters of Credit to be issued from such Lender (in its capacity as an L/C Issuer) hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any such responses;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender to give such notice shall not obligate such Lender to advance Committed Loans or Swing Line Loans or to issue Letters of Credit to the extent it is unlawful for such Lender to do so. Following the Companys receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent of any such responses, the Company may, in its discretion, terminate the applicable Subsidiarys designation as an Applicant Borrower. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that prior to any Applicant Borrower becoming entitled to utilize the credit facilities provided for herein the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the
49
Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders in their sole discretion, Notes signed by such new Borrowers to the extent any Lenders so require, and, if the designation of such Designated Borrower obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with know your customer or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary know your customer or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations. Promptly following receipt of all such requested resolutions, incumbency certificates, opinions of counsel and other documents or information, the Administrative Agent shall send a notice in substantially the form of
Exhibit I
(a 
Designated Borrower Confirmation
) to the Company and the Lenders specifying that effective as of the date of such Designated Borrower Confirmation the Applicant Borrower shall constitute a Designated Borrower for purposes hereof, whereupon each of the Lenders agrees to permit such Designated Borrower to request and be advanced Committed Loans
and Swing Line Loans hereunder and to apply for Letters of Credit to be issued hereunder, on the terms and conditions set forth herein, except to the extent it is unlawful for any such Lender to do so (in which case, it shall not be obligated to do so) and each of the parties agrees that such Designated Borrower otherwise shall be a Borrower for all purposes of this Agreement.
(c)
    
The Company shall guaranty the Obligations of each Designated Borrower pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guaranty. The Obligations of all Designated Borrowers shall be several in nature.
(d)
    
Each Subsidiary of the Company that is or
becomes a Designated Borrower pursuant to this
Section 2.15
hereby irrevocably appoints the Company, and the Company hereby accepts such appointment, as its agent for all purposes relevant to this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including (i) the giving and receipt of notices, (ii) the execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto, (iii) the receipt of the proceeds of any Loans made by the Lenders, to any such Designated Borrower hereunder and (iv) to be such Designated Borrowers Agent for the purpose of receiving, accepting and acknowledging service on its behalf in any legal process issued in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document. Any acknowledgment, consent, direction, certification or other action which might otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by all Borrowers, or by each Borrower acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by the Company, whether or not any such other Borrower joins therein. Any notice, demand, consent, acknowledgement, direction, certification or other communication delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered to each Designated Borrower.
(e)
    
The Company may from time to time, upon not less than 10 Business Days notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), terminate a Designated Borrowers status as such;
provided
that there are no outstanding Loans payable by such Designated Borrower, or other amounts payable or obligations outstanding by such Designated Borrower, as of the effective date of such termination. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such termination of a Designated Borrowers status.
(f)
    
If the Company shall designate as a Designated Borrower hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment hereunder with respect to such Designated Borrower by causing a branch or an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Designated Borrower (and such Lender shall, to the extent of Loans made to and participations in Swing
50
Line Loans made to, or in Letters of Credit issued for the account of, such Designated Borrower, be deemed for all purposes hereof to have pro tanto assigned such Loans and participations to such Affiliate in compliance with the provisions of
Section 10.06
);
provided
that the taking of any such actions by a branch or an Affiliate of such Lender shall not relieve any Lender of its obligations under this Agreement.
Cash Collateral
.
(a)
    
Certain Credit Support Events
. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrowers shall, in each case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations (to the extent such L/C Obligations are not otherwise Cash Collateralized hereunder). At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral to the extent required under
Section 2.17
.
(b)
    
Grant of Security Interest
. All Cash Collateral from the Company (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing accounts at JPMorgan. All Cash Collateral from a Defaulting Lender (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at JPMorgan. Each Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender), and agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have a first priority perfected security interest in and will have control within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code of such accounts and all such Cash Collateral, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.16(c)
. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrowers will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
(c)
    
Application
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this
Section 2.16
or
Sections 2.04
,
2.05
,
2.06
,
2.17
or
8.02
in respect of Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was specifically provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be required herein.
(d)
    
Release
. The Administrative Agent agrees to determine whether there exists excess Cash Collateral on a monthly basis and otherwise from time to time promptly upon the request of the Company. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by reallocation or otherwise pursuant to
Section 2.17
or by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
Section 10.06(b)(vi)
)) or (ii) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
provided
,
however
, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Borrower as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
Section 2.16
may be otherwise applied in accordance with
Section 8.03
), and (y) the Person providing
51
Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuers or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)
    
each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive a facility fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the Committed Loans funded by it, and (2) its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.16;
(b)
    
the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender and such Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentage of the Total Outstandings shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to, but subject to, Section 10.01);
(c)
    
if any Swing Line Exposure or L/C Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)
    
all or any part of the Swing Line Exposure and L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) the sum of the amount of all non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages of the Total Outstandings plus the amount of such Defaulting Lenders Swing Line Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders Commitments;
(ii)
    
if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) 
first
, prepay such Swing Line Exposure and (y) 
second
, Cash Collateralize for the benefit of the relevant L/C Issuers only the Borrowers obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.16 for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding;
(iii)
    
if the Company Cash Collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(h) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is Cash Collateralized;
(iv)
    
if the L/C Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04(h) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders Applicable Percentages; and
(v)
    
if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor Cash Collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any L/C Issuer or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lenders Commitment that was utilized by such L/C Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable
52
under Section 2.04(h) with respect to such Defaulting Lenders L/C Exposure shall be payable ratably to the relevant L/C Issuers until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or Cash Collateralized; and
(d)
    
so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Line Loan and no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lenders then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or Cash Collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with Section 2.17(c), and participating interests in any such newly made Swing Line Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.17(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
In the event that each of the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Swing Line Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes hereof, the Swing Line Exposure and L/C Exposure shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lenders Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swing Line Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage;
provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively for fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of a Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender;
provided
,
further
, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to non-Defaulting Lender will constitute any waiver or release of any claim hereunder resulting from such Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
Extension of Maturity Date
.
(a)
    
Requests for Extension
. The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders) not earlier than 75 days and not later than 40 days prior to the next anniversary of the Closing Date (each such date, an 
Anniversary Date
), request that each Lender extend such Lenders Maturity Date then in effect hereunder (the 
Existing Maturity Date
) for an additional calendar year from the Existing Maturity Date;
provided
,
however
, that if the Company does not request an extension of the Existing Maturity Date in a timely manner prior to any Anniversary Date it may, but shall not be obligated to, request that the Existing Maturity Date be extended for two consecutive calendar years from the Existing Maturity Date by making a request therefor in a timely manner prior to the next succeeding Anniversary Date.
(b)

NonExtending Lender
) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise the Administrative Agent on or before the Notice Date shall be deemed to be a NonExtending Lender.

Section 10.16
;
provided
that each of such Additional Commitment Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lender shall, effective as of the applicable Anniversary Date, undertake a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lenders Commitment hereunder on such date).
(e)
    
Minimum Extension Requirement
. Effective as of the applicable Anniversary Date, the Maturity Date of each Lender that has agreed to extend its Maturity Date (each, an 
Extending Lender
) and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date falling one or two, as applicable, calendar year(s) after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a Lender for all purposes of this Agreement.
(f)
    
Conditions to Effectiveness of Extensions
. As a condition precedent to such extension, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of each Borrower dated as of the applicable Anniversary Date signed by a Responsible Officer of such Borrower (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Borrower approving or consenting to such extension and (ii) in the case of the Company, certifying that, both immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties of the Borrowers contained in
Article V
or in any other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the applicable Anniversary Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (B) no Default exists. In addition, on each Anniversary Date on which the Existing Maturity Date is extended, the Borrowers shall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to

ARTICLE III
    
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
Taxes
.

Any and all payments by any Borrower to or for the account of the Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding
, in the case of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income taxes) and branch profits taxes imposed by the United States and any similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or the principal office or applicable Lending Office is maintained or is otherwise treated as doing business in such jurisdiction, (ii) taxes as a result of a failure of the Lender or the Administrative Agent to provide any required forms or exemption certificate or other documentation it was legally entitled to provide or a failure to comply with any of its covenants and agreements herein, including, without limitation,
Section
54
10.15
, (iii) in the case of a successor, assign or Participant, any withholding tax that is imposed on amounts payable to such successor, assign or Participant at the time such successor, assign or Participant becomes a party hereto (or designates a new lending office), except to the extent that such successor, assign or Participant (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment or participation) to receive additional amounts from any Borrower with respect to such withholding tax, (iv) any U.S. backup withholding taxes, (v) any U.S. Federal withholding taxes imposed by FATCA (including taxes on passthru payments made by any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Participant or any of their respective successors or assigns), (vi) any other taxes imposed as a result of the Administrative Agents or any Lenders gross negligence or willful misconduct and (vii) taxes and special assessments of any kind imposed solely as a result of a present or former connection between such recipient and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or special assessment (other than any such connection arising solely from such recipient having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, any of the Loan Documents) (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as 
Taxes
). If any Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment, such Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

In addition, the applicable Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document, excluding, however, such amounts imposed as a result of an assignment or a grant of a participation (hereinafter referred to as 
Other Taxes
).
(l)
    
Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes in the full amount (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 3.01
) that are necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (taking into account and giving effect to any tax benefits afforded such Lender or the Administrative Agent in connection with or directly as a result of the imposition of such Taxes or Other Taxes) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes, as the case may be, had not been imposed, and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, except with respect to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, for such Taxes, Other Taxes or a liability arising from such Lenders or the Administrative Agents, as the case may be, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date the applicable Lender or Agent makes written demand therefor specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section 3.01
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation;
provided
that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
Section 3.01
for any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on such Lender more than 60 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of such Taxes or Other Taxes and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that
, if the imposition of such Taxes or Other Taxes is retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
55
retroactive effect thereof.
(m)
    
Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or a L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from the funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer in good faith determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),
provided
that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
(n)
    
If any Borrower is required to pay any amount to any Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.01
, then such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate, or reduce the amount of, any such additional payment by such Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Person.
(o)
    
Except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.01(h)
, no Designated Borrower that is a resident of Ireland for tax purposes shall be required to make an increased payment to a Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 3.01
for Taxes in respect of tax imposed by Ireland from a payment of interest if on the date on which the payment falls due the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a deduction for Taxes if it was a Qualifying Lender, but on that date such Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or double taxation treaty, or any published practice or concession of any relevant taxing authority. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender with respect to a Designated Borrower that is a resident of Ireland for tax purposes, hereby represents that (i) in the case of each Lender that is a signatory hereto, as of the Closing Date it is a Qualifying Lender and (ii) in the case of a Lender that becomes a Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption in accordance with
Section 10.06
, as of the Effective Date of such Assignment and Assumption it is a Qualifying Lender.
(p)
    
A Lender and each Designated Borrower which makes a payment to which that Lender is entitled shall co-operate promptly in completing any procedural formalities necessary for such Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a withholding tax deduction. Each Lender shall cooperate with all reasonable requests for information made by any Designated Borrower that is a resident of Ireland for the purposes of enabling such Designated Borrower to determine the correct position regarding withholding tax on payments of interest under this Agreement.     
56
(q)
    
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Designated Borrower that is a resident of Ireland for tax purposes shall remain liable for any Taxes incurred by any Qualifying Lender resulting from such Designated Borrowers failure to provide any forms or exemption certificate or other documentation it is legally required to provided to entitle any Qualifying Lender to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of Ireland, or any treaty to which Ireland is a party.
(r)
    
Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers, if any, to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lenders failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 10.06(d)
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges and liabilities attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges and liabilities were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this
Section 3.01(i)
.
Illegality
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Offshore
Rate Loans or issue Letters of Credit in an Offshore Currency, or (if such Lender is the Swing Line Lender) for the Swing Line Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Swing Line Loans in an Offshore Currency, as it would otherwise be obligated hereunder to make, maintain or fund, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or the applicable Offshore Currency in the applicable offshore interbank market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Offshore
Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation existing hereunder of such Lender to make or continue Offshore
Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Offshore
Rate Committed Loans or to issue Letters of Credit in such Offshore Currency or to make Swing Line Loans in such Offshore Currency shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Offshore Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore
Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore
Rate Loans, and prepay all such Swing Line Loans in such Offshore Currency. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay (or shall cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) accrued and unpaid interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender or make it impracticable for such Lender to fund Loans within the time periods required under this Agreement.
Inability to Determine Rates
. If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders reasonably determine in connection with any request for an Offshore Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits in Dollars or the applicable Offshore Currency are not being offered
57
to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Offshore Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Offshore Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or any Committed Loan Offshore Currency), or (c) such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Offshore Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent (following notice from the Required Lenders if they make such determination) will promptly notify the Company and all Lenders, except as set forth below. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Offshore Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice:
(i)
    
the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Offshore Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies on the last day of the Interest Period therefore, or, failing that, with respect to any request for an Offshore Rate Committed Loan in the affected currency or currencies, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein; and
(ii)
    
with respect to any Offshore Rate Committed Loans outstanding on the date of receipt by the Company of any such notice from the Administrative Agent, the rate of interest on each Lenders share of any outstanding Offshore Rate Committed Loan for the Interest Period with respect thereto shall be a rate per annum equal to (x) the Offshore Rate for such Offshore Rate Committed Loan in effect on the date of receipt of such notice
plus
(y) the Applicable Margin.
Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on Offshore Rate Loans
.
(h)
    
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender reasonably determines (which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender or the Administrative Agent under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender or the Administrative Agent then reasonably determines to be relevant) that (i) as a result of any Change in Law there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or participating in Swing Line Loans and Offshore Currency Committed Loans, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing including, without limitation, as a result of the Administrative Agent or such Lender becoming subject to any taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges and liabilities on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (v) any taxes imposed by FATCA (including taxes on any passthru payments made by any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Participant or any of their respective successors or assigns), (w) Taxes imposed on payments hereunder or Other Taxes (as to which
Section 3.01
shall govern), (x) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office, (y) reserve requirements contemplated by
Section 3.04(f)
, and (z) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below), or (ii) the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, does not represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Offshore Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of the
58
Administrative Agent or such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent or such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.
(i)
    
If any Lender reasonably determines (which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant) that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lenders obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity and such Lenders desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.
(j)
    
If any Lender requests compensation by any Borrower under the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04
, the Company may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue Loans of the Type with respect to which such compensation is requested, or to convert Loans of any other Type into Loans of such Type, until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect; provided, such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.
(k)
    
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation;
provided
that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 60 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that
, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
(l)
    
Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for compensation under this
Section 3.04
and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
(m)
    
The Company shall, to the extent not provided for in the calculation of the Offshore Rate, pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as Eurocurrency liabilities), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Offshore Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be
required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Offshore Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, which in each case shall be due
59
and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan;
provided
the Company shall have received at least 10 days prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional
interest or
costs shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
Funding Losses
.
(g)
    
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate (or shall cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense reasonably incurred by it as a result of:
(i)
    
any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or, to the extent such payment or prepayment is demanded by the Swing Line Lender prior to an Event of Default, an Offshore Currency Swing Line Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(ii)
    
any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount specified in a notice given by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower, as the case may be; or
(iii)
    
the assignment of any Offshore Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.16;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company or any Designated Borrower, as applicable, to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05(a)
, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Offshore Rate Loan made by it at the rate used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other Borrowing in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
Survival
. All of the Borrowers obligations under
Sections 3.01
,
3.02
and
3.04
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(d)
    
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties in connection with the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement and the administration of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any transactions other than the transactions under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, other corporate transactions, other financial matters and custodial relationships between the Person acting as Administrative Agent (and not in its capacity as Administrative Agent), any Borrower or any Borrowers Affiliates, and except as otherwise agreed to in writing by such Persons);

Sections 10.01
and
8.02
) except, in each case for this clause (i), to the extent of its gross negligence or willful misconduct or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Delegation of Duties

The
77
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent or Affiliate may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and Affiliate and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and Affiliate, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders with the consent of the Company (if required) and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;
provided
that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Company (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agents resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.04
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its subagents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
(k)
    
Any resignation by JPMorgan as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as an L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender. Upon the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as another Lender is willing to act as a swing line lender, such successor shall not be required to
78
succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as another L/C Issuer is willing to and has satisfied the provisions of clause (c) of the preceding sentence, such successor shall not be required to succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer nor satisfy the requirements of such clause (c).
Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders
. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Sections 2.10
and

unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided
,
however
, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met; and

Certain Additional Payments
. In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, at the request of the Company, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01
,
3.04
,
3.05
, and
10.04
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.
(h)
    
Register
. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agents Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
88
(the 
Register
). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(i)
    
Participations
. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a 
Participant
) in all or a portion of such Lenders rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lenders participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lenders obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) such Lender shall remain the holder of its Loans and owner of its interest in the Credit Agreement for all purposes hereunder.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01
that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01
,
3.04
and
3.05
(subject to the requirements and limitations with respect thereto) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.04 and 10.16 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment which (i) would accrue to such Participant if it were deemed to be a Lender under Section 3.01 or 3.04 (and subject to the requirements and limitations with respect thereto) and (ii) results from a Change in Law for which a Participant would be entitled to compensation under Section 3.01 or Section 3.04 (in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (i)) that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Companys request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.04 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.08
as though it were a Lender;
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.14
as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the 
Participant Register
);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participants interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
89
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(j)
    
Limitations upon Participant Rights
. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender or a Qualifying Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 3.01
unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with
Section 10.15
as though it were a Lender.
(k)
    
Certain Pledges
. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(l)
    
Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time JPMorgan or any other Lender then acting as an L/C Issuer assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, JPMorgan or such other Lender, as the case may be, may, (i) upon 30 days notice to the Company and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer and/or (ii) in the case of JPMorgan, upon 30 days notice to the Company, resign as Swing Line Lender. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the Company shall be entitled, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to appoint from among the Lenders that have accepted such appointment a successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder;
provided
,
however
, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of JPMorgan or such other Lender as an L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, or the resignation of such other Lender as an L/C Issuer. If JPMorgan or any other Lender then acting as an L/C Issuer resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.04(c)
) until such time as the obligations relating to such outstanding Letters of Credit are assigned, assumed, released, terminated or paid in full (other than indemnification and other contingent obligations). If JPMorgan resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Committed Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to
Section 2.05(c)
until such time as the obligations relating to such outstanding Swing Line Loans are assigned, assumed, released, terminated or paid in full (other than indemnification and other contingent obligations). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to JPMorgan or such other Lender, as the case may be, to effectively assume the obligations of JPMorgan or such other Lender, as the case may be, with respect to such Letters of Credit.

.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) on a confidential, need-to-know basis, to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and
90
other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)
or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction (including, without limitation, credit insurance providers) relating to a Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any L/C Issuer or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than a Borrower. In addition, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments and the Credit Extensions. For purposes of this Section, 
Information
 means all information received from any Borrower relating to such Borrower or any other Borrower or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (a) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the a Borrower, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws.
Set-off
. In addition to any other rights and remedies that such Lender or such L/C Issuer may have, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Lender and each L/C Issuer is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to any Borrower, any such notice being waived by each Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or such L/C Issuer to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of such Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided
that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of set-off hereunder, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section 2.17
and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
91
Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of set-off. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees promptly to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or such L/C Issuer;
provided
,
however
, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
Interest Rate Limitation
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the 
Maximum Rate
). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations.

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in
Section 4.01
, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
Survival of Representations and Warranties
. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall survive in full force and effect until payment in full of all Obligations (other than indemnification and other contingent obligations).
Severability
. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.12
, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited
92
No advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
.
In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers are arms-length commercial transactions between such Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers, on the other hand, (B) such Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) such Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) in connection with the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement and the administration of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Arranger, as applicable, each is and has been acting solely as a principal and has not been, is not and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for such Borrower or any of its Affiliates or any other Person (it being understood that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any other transactions, including, without limitation, other corporate transactions, other financial matters and custodial relationships between such parties, and except as otherwise agreed to by the relevant parties) and (B) neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor any Arranger has any obligation to such Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of such Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor any Arranger has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to such Borrower or its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Borrowers hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby except to the extent provided otherwise in clause (ii) above.
Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents
.
The words execution, signed, signature, and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption or in any amendment or other modification hereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
Tax Forms
.
In the event that a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i)
    
duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for exemption from United States Federal withholding tax under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(ii)
    
duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
93
(iii)
    
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a bank within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10 percent shareholder of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN,
(iv)
    
IRS Form W-81MY and all required supporting documentation, or
(v)
    
any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lenders status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender to the extent that it may legally do so, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lenders entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lenders status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction.
(a)
    
Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.
(b)
    
If a payment made to a Lender or a Participant under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lenders obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
Section 10.15(c)
, FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Replacement of Lenders
.
If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04
, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01
, or if any Lender gives notice under
Section 3.02
, or if any Lender is a Restricted Lender (as defined below),
or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Company the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
94
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 10.06
), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that:
(a)
    
the Company shall have paid (or caused a Designated Borrower to pay) to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.06(b)
;
(b)
    
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05
) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(c)
    
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04
or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01
, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(d)
    
in the case of any such assignment by a Restricted Lender, the assignee must have approved in writing the substance of the amendment, waiver or consent which caused the assignor to be a Restricted Lender;
and
(e)
    
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this
Section 10.16
may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company and the assignee and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto.
For the purposes of this
Section 10.16
, a Restricted
Lender
 means a Lender that fails to approve an amendment, waiver or consent requested by the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01
that has received the written approval of not less than the Required Lenders but also requires the approval of such Lender.
Judgment Currency
. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency
) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the 
Agreement Currency
), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case
95
may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

Waiver of Notice; Subrogation

(a)
    
The Guarantor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law notice of the following events or occurrences: (i) acceptance of this Guaranty Agreement; (ii) the Lenders' heretofore, now or from time to time hereafter making Loans and issuing Letters of Credit and otherwise loaning monies or giving or extending credit to or for the benefit of any Designated Borrower, or otherwise entering into arrangements with any Designated Borrower giving rise to Guaranteed Liabilities, whether pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document or Related Agreement or any amendments, modifications, or supplements thereto, or replacements or extensions thereof; (iii) presentment, demand, default, non-payment, partial payment and protest; and (iv) any other event, condition, or occurrence described in
Section 3

(c)
    
The Guarantor further agrees with respect to this Guaranty Agreement that it shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnity, nor any right of recourse to security for the Guaranteed Liabilities unless and until 93 days immediately following the Facility Termination Date (as defined below) shall have elapsed without the filing or commencement, by or against any Designated Borrower, of any state or federal action, suit, petition or proceeding seeking any reorganization, liquidation or other relief or arrangement in respect of creditors of, or the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, trustee or conservator in respect to, such Designated Borrower or its assets. This waiver is expressly intended to prevent the existence of any claim in respect to such subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or indemnity by the Guarantor against the estate of any Designated Borrower within the meaning of Section 101 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the event of a subsequent case involving any Designated Borrower. If an amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such rights at any time prior to termination of this Guaranty Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
