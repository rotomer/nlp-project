STRYKER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2012 RESULTS
Kalamazoo, Michigan - October 17, 2012 - Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) reported operating results for the third quarter of 2012 with net sales of $2.1 billion, up 1.0% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share
(1)
of $0.97, an increase of 6.6%.
Our third quarter results reflect solid performance for most of our U.S. franchises, however, this was partly offset by weaker results from key countries outside the U.S. and our capital businesses, commented Kevin A. Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. We expect market conditions to remain challenging in Europe and for capital equipment, and as a result we are lowering our earnings outlook for 2012 and 2013. This will ensure that Stryker makes the necessary investments to strengthen its position as a market leader while continuing to deliver leveraged earnings gains.
Sales Analysis
Consolidated net sales of $2.1 billion increased 1.0% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 2.9% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 3.4% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.4% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 0.9% due to changes in price and 1.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 2.5% in constant currency over the prior year.
Reconstructive net sales of $891 million decreased 1.1% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and increased 1.1% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 2.4% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.1% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.4% due to changes in price and 2.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Reconstructive net sales increased 1.0% in constant currency over the prior year.
MedSurg net sales of $781 million increased 1.7% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 3.1% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 3.3% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix. This increase was partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 0.2% due to changes in price and 1.4% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales.
Neurotechnology and Spine net sales of $380 million increased 4.7% in the quarter over the prior year, as reported, and 6.9% in constant currency. Net sales in the quarter grew by 6.0% due to increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 2.1% as a result of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.3% due to changes in price and 2.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Neurotechnology and Spine net sales increased 4.7% in constant
currency over the prior year.
Earnings Analysis
Reported net earnings in the quarter include restructuring and related charges of $11 million (net of taxes), and acquisition and integration related charges of $6 million (net of taxes) related to acquisitions completed in 2011. These charges reduced reported gross profit margin from 68.2% to 68.1% and reported operating income margin from 22.9% to 21.9%.
Excluding the charges described above, adjusted net earnings
(2)
of $370 million increased 5.1% in the quarter over the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share
(1)
of $0.97 increased 6.6% in the quarter over the prior year.
Net earnings of $353 million increased 8.0% in the quarter over the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 increased 9.5% in the quarter over the prior year.
During the quarter, Stryker repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a cost of $19 million.
Outlook
The financial forecast for 2012 includes a constant currency sales increase of 4% to 5.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 0% to 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2012. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales growth is projected to be 2.5% to 4% in constant currency over the prior year.
The company now projects 2012 adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.04 to $4.07, an increase of 9% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.72 in the prior year. The company also projects 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.40.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS
RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments, and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share:
