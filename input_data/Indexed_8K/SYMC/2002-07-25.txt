ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS.
     Symantec has clarified its policy regarding securities trades by company personnel to expressly permit sales of the company's securities under plans instituted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. These plans are designed to allow executive officers to diversify their holdings but dispel any inference that they are purchasing or selling their company's stock on the basis of, or while they are aware of, material nonpublic information.
     John W. Thompson, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has adopted a 10b5-1 plan. This plan provides for quarterly sales of shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to volume limits and minimum price requirements. The plan is effective immediately and will expire on December 31, 2004, unless terminated earlier. Mr. Thompson currently holds approximately 240,000 shares and stock options to purchase approximately 3.4 million additional shares of Symantec common stock.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
