ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS.
     Symantec's policy regarding securities trades by company personnel permits sales of the company's securities under plans instituted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. These plans are designed to allow directors and executive officers to diversify their holdings but dispel any inference that they are purchasing or selling their company's stock on the basis of, or while they are aware of, material nonpublic information.
     Gail Hamilton, the company's Executive Vice President and General Manager, Global Services and Support, and Janice Chaffin, the company's Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, have adopted 10b5-1 plans. These plans provide for periodic sales of shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to certain volume limits and minimum price requirements. These plans are effective immediately.
