ITEM 8.01: OTHER EVENTS.
     Symantec's policy regarding securities trades by company personnel permits sales of the company's securities under plans instituted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. These plans are designed to allow directors and executive officers to diversify their holdings but dispel any inference that they are purchasing or selling their company's stock on the basis of, or while they are aware of, material nonpublic information.
     Arthur F. Courville, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary has adopted a 10b5-1 plan. This plan provides for periodic sales of shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to certain volume limits and minimum price requirements. This plan is effective immediately.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
