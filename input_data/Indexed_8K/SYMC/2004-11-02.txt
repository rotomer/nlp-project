ITEM 1.01: ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On October 20, 2004, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted Gregory E. Myers, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, 100,000 shares of restricted stock of Symantec Corporation at a purchase price per share of $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000.00 pursuant to a restricted stock purchase agreement dated October 20, 2004 under the Symantec Corporation 1996 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. As long as Mr. Myers continues to be employed by Symantec Corporation, one-half of these shares will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, and the remainder will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date.
ITEM 8.01: OTHER EVENTS.
     Symantec's policy regarding securities trades by company personnel permits sales of the company's securities under plans instituted pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. These plans are designed to allow directors and executive officers to diversify their holdings but dispel any inference that they are purchasing or selling their company's stock on the basis of, or while they are aware of, material nonpublic information.
     Gregory E. Myers, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, has adopted a 10b5-1 plan. This plan provides for periodic sales of shares on the open market at prevailing market prices, subject to certain volume limits and minimum price requirements. This plan is effective immediately.
