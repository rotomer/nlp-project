Explanatory Note:
This Amendment No. 1 is filed solely to correct two typographical errors in Slide No. 23 of Exhibit 99.01, which was furnished in the Form 8-K filed by Symantec Corporation ("Symantec") on May 31, 2005. In Slide No. 23, which represents Symantec's reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures ($ in thousands except per share amounts), the Non-GAAP gross profit included in the June '05 reconciliation column should be $599,240 rather than $710,000, and the GAAP gross profit in the same column should be $588,302 rather than $699,062. The corrected Exhibit 99.01 is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
