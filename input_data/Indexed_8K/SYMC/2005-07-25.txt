ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On July 19, 2005, Symantec Corporation ("Symantec") adopted the FY06 Executive Supplemental Incentive Plans for certain executive officers of Symantec who were executive officers of Symantec prior to July 2, 2005. Under the terms of these plans, the executive officers will be eligible to receive performance-based incentive bonuses equivalent to the bonuses payable under, and upon terms substantially similar to, Symantec's FY06 Executive Annual Incentive Plans. The supplemental incentive bonuses are in addition to the incentive bonuses under the FY06 Executive Annual Incentive Plans. The target payouts under the FY06 Executive Supplemental Incentive Plans are 60% to 125% of a participant's annual base salary. The actual bonus amounts are subject to the following metrics and weighting: (a) achievement of targeted annual revenue growth of the company (50% weighting); and (b) achievement of targeted annual earnings per share growth of the company (50% weighting). John Schwarz, President of Symantec, will be entitled to receive not less than 60% of his target bonus amount. In addition, the supplemental incentive bonus may be increased up to a maximum of 50% of the calculated bonus amount for any executive officer, based on the executive officer's impact on and contributions to the integration of VERITAS Software Corporation into Symantec.
