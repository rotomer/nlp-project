ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
Symantec Corporation (the "Company") permits its directors, officers and employees to enter into stock trading plans adopted pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Rule 10b5-1 allows insiders to sell and diversify their holdings in the Company over a designated period by adopting pre-arranged stock trading plans at a time when they are not aware of material nonpublic information about the Company, and thereafter sell shares of the Company's common stock in accordance with the terms of their stock trading plans.
On August 15, 2005, Gary Bloom, the Company's President and Vice Chairman, adopted a stock trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to which his broker will undertake to sell in the open market, on specified dates from November 2005 through August 2006, up to a maximum of 1,221,000 shares of common stock of the Company to be issued upon the exercise of existing employee stock options. After giving effect to the potential sale of these shares and should all of these shares be sold under the stock trading plan, Mr. Bloom will continue to hold, as of August 15, 2005, employee stock options to acquire approximately 3.46 million shares of the Company's common stock.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
