Item 8.01. Other Events
On March 22, 2006, Symantec Corporation (the "Company") announced to its employees that on March 30, 2006, the Company will accelerate the vesting of certain stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than $27.00 per share that are outstanding on that date. The Company will not accelerate the vesting of any such stock options held by the Company's executive officers or directors.
The acceleration of vesting is effective for stock options outstanding as of March 30, 2006. Options to purchase approximately 6.7 million shares of common stock, or approximately 14% of the Company's outstanding unvested options, will be accelerated. The weighted average exercise price of the stock options subject to this acceleration is approximately $28.73.
The Company's purpose for implementing the acceleration is to reduce future stock option compensation expense that the Company would otherwise be required to recognize in its results of operations after adoption of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), The Company will adopt FAS No. 123(R) on April 1, 2006, which is the beginning of the Company's 2007 fiscal year. The Company estimates that the pre-tax charge to be avoided would be approximately $80 million over the remaining portion of the original vesting periods, which on average is approximately 2.5 years from the effective date of the acceleration.
