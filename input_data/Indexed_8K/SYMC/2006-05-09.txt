FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:
 
Symantec Closes Fiscal Year 2006 with Solid March Quarter Page 5 of 11
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Symantec reports non-GAAP financial results. All references to "combined non-GAAP" financial information for pre-acquisition periods include the results of Symantec and VERITAS for like fiscal quarters (i.e., combining the results of Symantec for the March 2005 fiscal quarter with the results of VERITAS for the December 2004 fiscal quarter) and have been adjusted to exclude certain expenses, net of tax, and include adjustments based on the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date of July 2, 2005 and deferred revenue that was eliminated as a result of purchase accounting for the VERITAS acquisition. Symantec's management believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information that facilitates comparisons to prior periods. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial results, develop budgets and manage expenditures. The method Symantec uses to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP, may differ from the methods used by other companies and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to this release. Additional information regarding the reconciliation, along with additional pro forma financial information, can be found on the investor relations page of Symantec's Web site, along with additional pro forma financial information for the combined company, at .

* For the twelve months ended March 31, 2005, diluted net income per share is calculated using the if-converted method. Under this method, the numerator excludes the interest expense from the 3% convertible subordinated notes, net of income tax, of $8.4 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2005, and the denominator includes shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the 3% convertible subordinated notes.
 
NOTES:
The above information reflects the combined results of Symantec Corporation ("Symantec") and VERITAS Software Corporation ("VERITAS"), including amounts related to the amortization of fair value adjustments of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by Symantec as of the actual acquisition date of July 2, 2005. For comparative purposes, the information presented assumes that the acquisition took place on April 1, 2004. If the acquisition had taken place on April 1, 2004, the fair values of the assets and liabilities would have been different and actual results of operations would have been different from those presented above.
Additional non-GAAP adjustments consist of: non-cash charges related to acquisitions, such as the amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation expense, and the write-off of in-process research and development; restructuring charges; integration planning costs; and the impact of other special items, such as other stock-based compensation expense, litigation matters, gain/loss on investments and related adjustments to provision for income taxes on our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
(*) The results of operations include our results for the three months ended March 31, 2005.
(**) The results of operations include VERITAS' historical results for the three months ended December 31, 2004, including amortization related to fair value adjustments based on the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date of July 2, 2005.
