Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
     On July 12, 2006, Symantec Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among the Company, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Citicorp USA, Inc., as Syndication Agent, Bank of America, N.A., Morgan Stanley Bank and UBS Loan Finance LLC, as Co-Documentation Agents, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers.
     The Credit Agreement provides for a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, under which the Company may borrow funds. At the time of entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company did not draw down any funds under such agreement.
     The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and customary events of default, including among others, non payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, insolvency or inability to pay debts, bankruptcy, or a change of control (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
     The Credit Agreement terminates on July 11, 2011, at which time any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement are due. The Company may optionally prepay loans under the Credit Agreement at any time, without penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs in the case of LIBOR based borrowings.
