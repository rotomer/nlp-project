Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 13, 2006, at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Symantec Corporation (the "Company"), the Company's stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Company 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The amendment and restatement effects the following material changes to the Plan:
The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") approved the amendment and restatement of the Plan on July 18, 2006, effective upon stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting.
As previously announced, pursuant to discussions of the Company with Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), management of the Company has determined to recommend to the Board that it amend Section 16 of the Plan to delete the second sentence in such section to clarify that the Company may not engage in a cash-for-equity exchange without prior stockholder approval. The Company expects the Board to so amend the Plan at the next meeting of the Board.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
