Release
,
 
the Company in which Executive participated and under which Executive has accrued or become entitled to a benefit) or a termination thereof.
     6. . Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for herein be reduced by any compensation earned by other employment or otherwise.
No Mitigation Obligation
     7. . Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any subsidiary prior to or following any Change in Control.
Employment Rights
     8. 
Tax Matters
     (a) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law, regulation or ruling.
Withholding of Taxes
     (b) Parachute Excise Tax. In the event that any amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise to Executive would (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any comparable successor provisions and (ii) but for this Subsection (b) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code or any comparable successor provisions (the "Excise Tax"), then such amounts payable to Executive hereunder shall be either:
          (i) Provided to Executive in full; or
          (ii) Provided to Executive to the maximum extent that would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax;
whichever of the foregoing amounts, when taking into account applicable federal, state, local and foreign income and employment taxes, the Excise Tax and any other applicable taxes, results in the receipt by Executive, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under the Excise Tax. Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Subsection (b) shall be made in writing in good faith by a nationally recognized accounting firm (the "Accountants"). In the event of a reduction in benefits hereunder, the reduction of the total payments shall apply as follows, unless otherwise agreed in writing and such agreement is in compliance with section 409A of the Code: (i) first, any cash severance payments due under this Agreement shall be reduced, with the last such payment due first forfeited and reduced, and sequentially thereafter working from the next last payment, and (ii) second, any acceleration of vesting of any equity shall remain as originally scheduled to vest, with the tranche that would vest last (without any such acceleration) first remaining as originally scheduled to vest. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Subsection (b), the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning
 
applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of the Code and other applicable legal authority. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Subsection (b). The Company shall bear all costs that the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Subsection (b).
If, notwithstanding any reduction described in this Subsection (b), the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax as a result of the receipt of amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise as described above, then Executive shall be obligated to pay back to the Company, within thirty (30) days after a final IRS determination or, in the event that Executive challenges the final IRS determination, a final judicial determination, a portion of such amounts equal to the Repayment Amount. The "Repayment Amount" with respect to the payment of benefits shall be the smallest such amount, if any, that is required to be paid to the Company so that Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to any payment of benefits (after taking into account the payment of the Excise Tax and all other applicable taxes imposed on such payment) are maximized. The Repayment Amount with respect to the payment of benefits shall be zero if a Repayment Amount of more than zero would not result in Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of such benefits being maximized. If the Excise Tax is not eliminated pursuant to this paragraph, Executive shall pay the Excise Tax.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection (b), if (i) there is a reduction in the payment of benefits as described in this Subsection (b), (ii) the IRS later determines that Executive is liable for the Excise Tax, the payment of which would result in the maximization of Executive's net after-tax proceeds (calculated as if Executive's benefits had not previously been reduced), and (iii) Executive pays the Excise Tax, then the Company shall pay to Executive those benefits which were reduced pursuant to this Subsection (b) as soon as administratively possible after Executive pays the Excise Tax, so that Executive's net after-tax proceeds with respect to the payment of benefits are maximized.
     9. . This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the "Initial Term"), and shall automatically renew for additional one (1) year renewal periods (a "Renewal Term") if Executive is employed by the Company on the last day of the Initial Term and on each Renewal Term; provided, however, that within the sixty (60) to ninety (90) day period prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, at its discretion, the Board, may propose, for consideration by Executive, such amendments to the Agreement as it deems appropriate. If Executive's employment with the Company terminates during the Initial Term or a Renewal Term, this Agreement shall remain in effect until all of the obligations of the parties hereunder are satisfied or have expired.
Term of Agreement
 
     10. .
Successors and Binding Agreement
          (a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by the Company.
          (b) This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees. This Agreement will supersede the provisions of any employment, severance or other agreement between the Executive and the Company that relate to any matter that is also the subject of this Agreement, and such provisions in such other agreements will be null and void.
          (c) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto will, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 10(a) and 10(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by the Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 10(c), the Company will have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.
     11. . For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five (5) business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after having been sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as FedEx or UPS, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the Company) at its principal executive office and to the Executive at his principal residence, or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be effective only upon receipt.

If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under section 409A of the Code, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. Any amount payable under this Agreement that constitutes deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code shall be paid at the time provided under this Agreement or such other time as permitted under section 409A of the Code. No interest will be payable with respect to any amount paid within a time period permitted by, or delayed because of, section 409A of the Code. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement that are deferred compensation may only be made upon a "separation from service" under section 409A of the Code. For purposes of section 409A of the Code, each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. In no event may Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment.
          (b) . To the maximum extent permitted under section 409A of the Code, the severance benefits payable under this Agreement are intended to comply with the "short-term deferral exception" under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4), and any remaining amount is intended to comply with the "separation pay exception" under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii); provided, however, any amount payable to Executive during the six (6) month period following Executive's Termination Date that does not qualify within either of the foregoing exceptions and constitutes deferred compensation subject to the requirements of section 409A of the Code, then such amount shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Excess Amount." If at the time of Executive's separation from service, the Company's (or any entity required to be aggregated with the Company under section 409A of the Code) stock is publicly-traded on an established securities market or otherwise and Executive is a "specified employee" (as defined in section 409A of the Code and determined in the sole discretion of the Company (or any successor thereto) in accordance with the Company's (or any successor thereto) "specified employee" determination policy), then the Company shall postpone the commencement of the payment of the portion of the Excess Amount that is payable within the six (6) month period following Executive's Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto) for six (6) months following Executive's Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto). The delayed Excess Amount shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive within ten (10) days following the date that is six (6) months following Executive's Termination Date with the Company (or any successor thereto). If Executive dies during such six (6) month period and prior to the payment of the portion of the Excess Amount that is required to be delayed on account of section 409A of the Code, such Excess Amount shall be paid to the personal representative of Executive's estate within sixty (60) days after Executive's death.
Payment Delay
 
          (c) . All reimbursements provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred during Executive's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the taxable year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Any tax gross up payments to be made hereunder shall be made not later than the end of Executive's taxable year next following Executive's taxable year in which the related taxes are remitted to the taxing authority.

     15. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Company.

Survival
     17. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
