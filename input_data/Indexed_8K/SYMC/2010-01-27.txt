Exhibit 99.01
News Release
Symantec Corp. (Nasdaq:SYMC) today reported the results of its third quarter of fiscal year 2010, ended Jan. 1, 2010. GAAP revenue for the fiscal third quarter was $1.548 billion. Non-GAAP revenue was $1.551 billion, up 1 percent over the comparable period a year ago (down 3 percent after adjusting for currency).
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Jan. 27, 2010 
"Our consumer business, with its market-leading solutions and diverse go-to-market channels, continued to show strong momentum," said Enrique Salem, president and chief executive officer, Symantec. "Our Security and Compliance business contributed to the better than expected results, driven by our ability to sell multiple security products to our customers. In addition, our hosted services, data loss prevention and compliance solutions performed well."
"We are encouraged by the improving trends in our license revenue and by the sequential stabilization of our maintenance revenues. This led to better than expected sequential and year-over-year growth in both revenue and deferred revenue," said James Beer, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "Our business continues to deliver strong cash flow from operations, generating approximately $1 billion over the last three quarters."
GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was 17.9 percent. GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter was $300 million compared with a $6.82 billion loss for the same quarter last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37 compared with a loss per share of $8.25 for the same quarter last year.
GAAP Results:
 
Symantec Reports Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2010 Results Page 2 of 4
Symantec realized a one-time benefit of $78.5 million to GAAP net income, or a $0.10 benefit to GAAP earnings per share in the December 2009 quarter as a result of the favorable ruling by the U.S. Tax Court regarding the Veritas Software tax assessment for 2000 and 2001. The company realized this one-time benefit because the previous accrual exceeded Symantec's revised estimated incremental tax liability. The GAAP net loss for the year-ago quarter includes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $7 billion.
GAAP deferred revenue as of Jan. 1, 2010, was $3.05 billion compared with $2.92 billion as of Jan. 2, 2009, up 4 percent. After adjusting for currency, GAAP deferred revenue increased 3 percent year-over-year.
Cash flow from operating activities for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $393 million. Symantec ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.61 billion.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was 28.3 percent. Non-GAAP net income for the fiscal third quarter was $326 million compared with $352 million for the year-ago period. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40 compared with earnings per share of $0.42 for the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP Results:
Symantec realized a one-time benefit of $16.5 million to non-GAAP net income, or a $0.02 benefit to non-GAAP earnings per share in the December 2009 quarter as a result of the previously mentioned favorable ruling by the U.S. Tax Court. The company realized this one-time benefit after releasing the accrual related to interest on the original tax assessment recorded since the Veritas acquisition.
Non-GAAP deferred revenue as of Jan. 1, 2010, was $3.07 billion compared with $2.96 billion as of Jan. 2, 2009, up 3 percent. After adjusting for currency, non-GAAP deferred revenue increased 2 percent year-over-year.
For a detailed reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results, please refer to the attached consolidated financial statements.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, Symantec repurchased 6.8 million shares for $121 million at an average price of $17.76 per share.

This press release contains statements regarding our financial and business results, which may be considered forward-looking within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws, including projections of future revenue, earnings per share and deferred revenue, as well as projections of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied in this press release. Such risk factors include those related to: general economic conditions; maintaining customer and partner relationships; the anticipated growth of certain market segments, particularly with regard to security and storage; the competitive environment in the software industry; changes to operating systems and product strategy by vendors of operating systems; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the timing and market acceptance of new product releases and upgrades; the successful development of new products and integration of acquired businesses, and the degree to which these products and businesses gain market acceptance. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements in this press release. We assume no obligation, and do not intend, to update these forward-looking statements as a result of future events or developments. Additional information concerning these and other risks factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of our Form 10-K for the year ended April 3, 2009.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:
Our results of operations have undergone significant change due to a series of acquisitions, the impact of SFAS 123(R), impairment charges and other corporate events. To help our readers understand our past financial performance and our future results, we supplement the financial results that we provide in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with non-GAAP financial measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed according to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies. Our non-GAAP results are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations' page of our Web site at

We include certain non-GAAP measures in the tracking and forecasting of our earnings and management of our business. For a detailed explanation of these non-GAAP measures, please see Symantec's Explanation of Non-GAAP Measures in Appendix A.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the tables adjust for the following items: business combination accounting entries, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and acquired product rights, impairments of assets and certain other items. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operating performance for the reasons discussed below. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons of the Company's performance to prior periods and to our peers and that investors benefit from an understanding of these non-GAAP financial measures.
We have completed several business combinations and acquisitions for a variety of strategic purposes over the past few years. As is the case with our existing business, at the time of acquisition, these acquired businesses recorded deferred revenue related to past transactions for which revenue would have been recognized by the acquired entity in future periods as revenue recognition criteria were satisfied. However, the purchase accounting entries for these acquisitions require us to write down a portion of this deferred revenue to its then current fair value. Consequently, in post acquisition periods, we do not recognize the full amount of this deferred revenue. When measuring the performance of our business, however, we add back non-GAAP revenue associated with obligations we assumed to provide maintenance or support to customers of the acquired business that was excluded as a result of these purchase accounting adjustments. We believe that this non-GAAP revenue presentation is appropriate both because it reveals, on a basis consistent with our own revenue recognition policies, the revenue associated with maintenance and support obligations assumed by us and because we have historically experienced high renewal rates on our acquired maintenance and support contracts. We also believe that the non-GAAP revenue disclosures enhance investors' ability to conduct period-over-period analyses of our results that reflect the full impact of the acquired business's results together with the results from our pre-existing products and services.
Deferred revenue related to acquisitions:
Consists of expenses for employee stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and our employee stock purchase plan determined in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. When evaluating the performance of our individual business units and developing short and long term plans, we do not consider stock-based compensation charges. Our management team is held accountable for cash-based compensation, but we believe that management is limited in its ability to project the impact of stock-based compensation and accordingly is not held accountable for its impact on our operating results. Although stock-based compensation is necessary to attract and retain quality employees, our consideration of stock- based compensation places its primary emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants. In addition, for comparability purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies. Furthermore, unlike cash-based compensation, the value of stock-based compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control.
Stock-based compensation:
When conducting internal development of intangible assets, accounting rules require that we expense the costs as incurred. In the case of acquired businesses, however, we are required to allocate a portion of the purchase price to the accounting value assigned to intangible assets acquired and amortize this amount over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. The acquired company, in most cases, has itself previously expensed the costs incurred to develop the acquired intangible assets, and the purchase price allocated to these assets is not necessarily reflective of the cost we would incur in developing the intangible asset. We eliminate these amortization charges from our non-GAAP operating results to provide better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and comparability to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets.
Amortization of acquired product rights and other intangible assets:
We have engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years that have resulted in costs associated with severance, benefits, outplacement services, and excess facilities. Each restructuring has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each has differed from the others in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope. We do not engage in restructuring activities in the ordinary course of business. While our operations previously benefited from the employees and facilities covered by our various restructuring charges, these employees and facilities have benefited different parts of our business in different ways, and the amount of these charges has varied significantly from period to period. We believe that it is important to understand these charges; however, we do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results and that investors benefit from an understanding of our operating results without giving effect to them.
Restructuring:
During the December 2008 quarter, given the economic environment and a decline in our market capitalization, we concluded there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill and other intangibles impairment analysis. In the December 2008 quarter, we recorded a $7.0 billion goodwill impairment charge, reflecting our best estimate of the goodwill impairment charge. We finalized our goodwill and other intangible impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and recorded an additional $413 million impairment charge.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets:
8
 
We have committed to sell certain buildings and land. We have classified these assets as held for sale and adjusted the assets' carrying value when above the fair market value less cost to sell. During the three months ended January 1, 2010, we sold a property for $42 million, which resulted in a loss of $10 million. We do not believe that these charges are indicative of future operating results and believe that investors benefit from an understanding of our operating results without giving effect to them.
Loss and impairment of assets held for sale:
These items are the result of currency translation adjustments on the liquidation of dormant entities. We exclude the impact of these items because they are not closely related to, or a function of, our ongoing operations.
Net gain on legal liquidation of foreign entities:
Effective April 4, 2009, we adopted new authoritative guidance on convertible debt instruments, which changes the method of accounting for our convertible notes. Under this new authoritative guidance, our EPS and net income calculated in accordance with GAAP will be reduced as a result of recognizing incremental non-cash interest expense. We believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes this incremental non-cash interest expense in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate the comparison of our results to the results of our peer companies.
Non-cash interest expense:
From time to time we are party to legal settlements. We exclude the impact of these settlements because we do not consider these settlements to be part of the ongoing operation of our business and because of the singular nature of the claims underlying the matter.
Patent settlement/settlements of litigation:
Consistent with the reasons discussed above, we exclude stock-based compensation charges and amortization of other intangible assets related to the joint venture from our non-GAAP net income.
Joint venture:
New authoritative guidance on business combinations requires us to record, into the statement of operations, certain items that were originally recorded to goodwill at the time of an acquisition. Our evaluation of the U.S. Tax Court's ruling on December 10, 2009, regarding the Veritas Software tax assessment for 2000 and 2001, necessitated this type of adjustment. For the three months ended January 1, 2010, we released certain tax accruals that were originally recorded to goodwill at the time of our July 2005 acquisition of Veritas. To enhance consistency and comparability of results across periods, we exclude the impact of the release of these accruals from our Non-GAAP results for the three months ended January 1, 2010. However, approximately $16.5 million of accruals that were released for the three months ended January 1, 2010 represent interest accruals attributed to the Veritas tax assessment that have been recorded to our income statement during post-acquisition periods. Accordingly, the amount of these accruals has not been excluded from Symantec's Non-GAAP results.
Release of pre-acquisition tax contingencies:
Due to an acceleration in the use of our Irish net operating losses ("NOLs"), we have released a portion of the tax valuation allowance that was originally recorded against these NOLs in relation to the impairment of goodwill that we recorded solely to our GAAP results during the three months ended January 2, 2009. To enhance consistency and comparability of results across periods, we exclude the impact of the release of the valuation allowance from our Non-GAAP results for the three months ended January 1, 2010.
Release of valuation allowance:
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the company modified its segment reporting structure to more readily match its operating structure. The following modifications were made to the segment reporting structure: Enterprise Vault products were moved to the Storage and Server Management segment from the Security and Compliance segment; and the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings were moved to either the Security and Compliance or the Storage and Server Management segment from the Services segment based on the nature of the service delivered. Fiscal year 2009 Enterprise Vault revenue of $197 million and fiscal year 2008 revenue of $168 million was moved, and fiscal year 2009 SaaS revenue of $51 million was moved. The predominant amount of SaaS revenue went to the Security and Compliance segment. The historical periods have been adjusted to reflect the modified reporting structure.
