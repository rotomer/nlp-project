On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Tax Court issued its opinion in , 133 T.C. No. 14 (""), finding that Symantec Corporation's transfer pricing methodology, with appropriate adjustments, was the best method for assessing the value of the transaction at issue between Veritas and its international subsidiary. In June 2010, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") concerning the amount of the adjustment related to the U.S. Tax Court opinion. On August 10, 2010, the Tax Court issued the final decision order. Under the Tax Court's decision, we owe no further taxes, interest or penalty for Veritas' 2000 and 2001 tax years. The time period for the IRS to initiate an appeal in expired on Monday, November 8, 2010. On November 10, 2010, the IRS confirmed that it had chosen not to appeal the U.S. Tax Court's decision. Accordingly, the matter has now been closed.
