EXHIBIT 99.1 SYSCO [LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SYSCO Corporation 1390 Enclave Parkway NEWS RELEASE Houston, Texas 77077-2099 (281)584-1390 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: John M. Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO'S FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE JUMP 19.3% FISCAL 2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 16.8% HOUSTON, AUGUST 11, 2003 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY) today announced its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003 results for the period ended June 28, 2003. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: 0 Diluted earnings per share rose 19.3%, to $0.37 compared to $0.31 in the same period last year 0 Net earnings climbed 17.9% to $243 million vs. $206 million in last year's fourth quarter 0 Sales increased 10.5% to $6.97 billion vs. $6.31 billion in last year's fourth quarter 0 Real sales growth for the fourth quarter was 6.1% FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS: 0 Diluted earnings per share increased 16.8%, to $1.18 compared to $1.01 last year 0 Net earnings increased 14.5% to $778 million vs. $680 million last year 0 Sales reached $26.14 billion, an 11.9% gain compared to sales of $23.35 billion last year 0 Real sales growth for the fiscal year was 6.7% Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Through the collective efforts of all SYSCO associates, we were able to achieve solid sales and earnings results for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. The 19.3 percent increase in earnings per share and the 10.5 percent rise in sales for the quarter represent our 109th consecutive quarter of sales and earnings gains. This accomplishment is a direct result of our efforts to provide superior customer service as we seek to help our customers succeed." Thomas E. Lankford, SYSCO's president and chief operating officer, said, "Product costs trended upward during the last half of the fiscal year, reversing the deflationary pressures experienced in the first half of the fiscal year, resulting in a flat rate for the entire year. The internally estimated inflation rate for the quarter was 2.5 percent, as opposed to the 0.8 percent inflation for the third fiscal quarter. This rapid price change was partially responsible for a 10-basis-point decline in fourth quarter gross margins compared to last year's fourth quarter, since essentially we absorbed some of the increases that occurred during the quarter. "Operating efficiencies," he continued, "and the use of best business practices and technology systems resulted in a 42 basis point reduction in operating expenses at our operating companies as a percent of total sales during the fourth quarter. Specifically, our operating company presidents have excelled in adopting our state-of-the-art systems and have shared their expertise across the country with other SYSCO companies, making our operations more efficient, productive and profitable." Mr. Lankford also noted that SYSCO remains committed to reinvesting in its business in order to continue to drive efficiencies. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 were $436 million and are projected to be between $490 and $510 million for fiscal 2004. Since the initiative began in fiscal 2002 and through the end of fiscal 2003, total cash expended for the National Supply Chain project was $81.2 million. Of that cumulative amount, $36.8 million has been
expensed and the remainder has been capitalized. For fiscal 2003, expenses for the project were $7.1 million during the fourth quarter and $21.4 million for fiscal 2003. Construction on the Northeast Redistribution Center is progressing on time and on budget and is expected to be operational in the summer of 2004. Located near Front Royal, Virginia, the center will receive and redistribute food and food-related products to 14 SYSCO operating companies in the Northeast, creating benefits for customers and suppliers, as well as for SYSCO. Commenting on SYSCO's uses of cash and cash flow performance, Mr. Schnieders said, "We invest to grow our business profitably through internal growth and profitable acquisitions, which has resulted in the strong historical sales and earnings performance that our shareholders have come to expect. The majority of the remaining money is returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During fiscal 2003, SYSCO paid $262 million in the form of dividends and spent $478 million in share repurchases for a total of $740 million. That is approximately 95 percent of the net earnings SYSCO generated during the year." Mr. Schnieders also added that approximately nine million shares remain on the company's current 20 million share repurchase program that was announced in July 2002. "SYSCO has completed all nine prior share repurchase programs," he said, "investing approximately three billion dollars since 1992 to buy back 219 million shares. Over the last five years SYSCO has returned $2.7 billion, or 94 percent of its net earnings, to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases." In concluding his remarks, Mr. Schnieders also noted that for fiscal 2004, which will be a 53-week fiscal year, SYSCO anticipates an effective income tax rate of 38.50 percent. This compares to the current rate of 38.25 percent, with the increase attributable to the increasing effective rates of state taxes. "Our internal and external growth strategies generated additional market share gains in fiscal 2003," he stated. "SYSCO's operational and financial fundamentals remain strong, our industry is growing, and we have exciting opportunities to continue to help our customers be successful." SYSCO is the largest foodservice marketing and distribution organization in North America, providing food and related products and services to approximately 415,000 restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCO's operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce, meat and hotel supply operations and SYGMA, the company's chain restaurant distribution subsidiary.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
