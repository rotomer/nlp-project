Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO'S FOURTH QUARTER DILUTED EPS RISE 16.2%; NET EARNINGS UP 15.6% HOUSTON, AUGUST 16, 2004 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY), North America's leading foodservice marketer and distributor, today announced results for the 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year that ended July 3, 2004. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: o Diluted earnings per share rose 16.2% to $0.43 compared to $0.37 in the same period last year. o Net earnings climbed 15.6% to $280.6 million vs. $242.7 million in last year's fourth quarter. o Sales increased 16.7% to $8.14 billion, including sales from acquisitions of 0.4%, for the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as opposed to $6.97 billion in the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Adjusted for 13 weeks vs. 13 weeks, sales were up 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. o Operating expenses as a percent to sales were 13.66%, a 34 basis point reduction in comparison to 14.00% in the same period last year. FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS: o Diluted earnings per share rose 16.1% to $1.37 compared to $1.18 last year. o Net earnings climbed 16.6% to $907.2 million vs. $778.3 million last year. o Sales increased 12.2% to $29.3 billion, including sales from acquisitions of 0.8%, for the 53-week fiscal year ended July 3, 2004 as opposed to $26.1 billion for the 52-week fiscal year ended June 28, 2003. Adjusted for 52 weeks vs. 52 weeks, sales rose 10.0% in fiscal 2004. o Operating expenses as a percent to sales were 14.12%, a 56 basis point reduction versus last year's 14.68%. In discussing the quarter, Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "SYSCO was able to generate solid sales and earnings numbers during the fourth quarter while competing in a market that can best be described as challenging. Our growth strategies, customer service initiatives and sound operational practices allowed our 49,000 associates to overcome the effects of 8.0 percent product inflation during the quarter and again generate positive results for our shareholders. "A softer foodservice market and prolonged product inflation of 6.3 percent for the fiscal year were the primary test our operating companies faced and continue to address," added Mr. Schnieders. "The dairy and meat categories, which are often sold on a cost-per-pound plus a fee per pound basis rather than on a percentage markup, experienced the highest rates of inflation. The overall impact of inflation, particularly on those two items, is a higher sales price but a lower profit margin as a percent to sales. This margin percentage contraction persisted throughout the fiscal year, making the foodservice environment a very tough arena for distributors and suppliers. Our restaurant operator customers also are experiencing softness in their sales as cost and price increases impact consumer spending. As a result, we experienced a moderate slowing of sales in the latter half of the fourth quarter which has continued for the first five weeks of the current quarter. Turning to fiscal year 2005, Mr. Schnieders added, "That being said, we believe our results confirm that we are the best-positioned distributor to deal with these issues. We are building this company with an eye on the future and will make the necessary investments, such - more - - 5 -
as our supply chain initiative, to position this company for future success. Our estimates are that we should incur approximately an additional $0.04 to $0.05 per share of expense, including depreciation of the first redistribution center, in fiscal 2005. We believe that strategic investments such as the redistribution center will enable us to continue to lower our cost of doing business over the longer term. In addition, we're working with our customers by consulting with them in product selection, pricing and quality issues to help them combat this longer-than-usual period of food cost increases. Finally, while we can't control inflation and its effects or the consumer spending cycle, we can control our expenses and we will be renewing our focus in the area of expense controls during fiscal 2005. These controls include a short-term hiring freeze, continued benchmarking of our operations and the ongoing sharing of best business practices at our companies. While moderating sales and the current inflationary environment are short-term issues, the discipline they impose on us to exercise sound expense controls will benefit us over the long-term as inflation returns to more typical levels." In discussing operations, Thomas E. Lankford, president and chief operating officer of SYSCO, added, "A persistent focus on profitable customers benefited us in the quarter. By providing business reviews and business development services to these valued customers, our ability to achieve our long-term performance objectives remains on track. "From an operational perspective, key metrics at our broadline companies registered incremental improvements in the fourth quarter, which in turn helped to drive down expenses by 34 basis points. Specifically, lines per stop increased approximately five percent and pieces per stop increased approximately four percent in the quarter compared to last year, indicating expanded sales to existing customers." Mr. Lankford also summarized SYSCO's major capital expenditures and acquisitions for the quarter and fiscal year including the opening of a broadline fold-out facility in Oxnard, California, that is servicing the northern Los Angeles foodservice market and the ongoing construction of a broadline fold-out facility in Post Falls, Idaho that is expected to be operational in the spring of 2005. SYSCO also expanded its export capabilities with the acquisition of Plant City, Florida-based International Food Group, a leading U.S.-based distributor of foodservice products to chain restaurants in international markets. Another acquisition, Overton Distributors, Inc., a produce distribution company with locations in Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee, occurred at the beginning of the fourth quarter. "We have made and will continue to make strategic investments to promote future growth in our operations and profitability," continued Mr. Lankford, who also indicated that SYSCO's capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 were $530.1 million, including $150.7 million that was spent in the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2005 the Company anticipates a slight reduction in capital expenditures - -- $475 to $500 million -- since several major replacements and fold-outs were completed in 2004. The National Supply Chain project progressed according to plan during the quarter and to date $216.0 million has been expended on the project since it began in fiscal 2002. Fourth quarter expenditures for the project were $33.4 million, $27.1 million of which was capitalized and is included in the $150.7 million capital spending for the quarter. SYSCO's broadline facility near Boston, which is scheduled to be the first company to go live with the Northeast Redistribution Center, began implementing their ramp-up in August and is scheduled to receive product in February 2005. By the fall of 2005 all 14 operating companies assigned to the Northeast Redistribution Center will be receiving product. "With a 16.6 percent increase in net earnings, fiscal 2004 was a solid year for SYSCO. The results are representative of the most valuable asset we have - our knowledgeable and dedicated associates," concluded Mr. Lankford. "Through their efforts, SYSCO's market share increased from 13 percent in fiscal 2003 to more than 14 percent in fiscal 2004. As they worked with our suppliers and customers to succeed during some difficult times, their efforts also - more - - 6 -
allowed SYSCO to return $918 million to our shareholders in fiscal 2004 in the form of share repurchases and dividends, or 101.2% of our fiscal 2004 net earnings. We have the people and strategies in place to maintain consistent future growth and we are confident we will continue our record of delivering sound results." SYSCO is the largest foodservice marketing and distribution organization in North America, providing food and related products and services to approximately 400,000 restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCO's operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce and custom-cut meat operations, Asian foodservice distributors, hotel supply operations and SYGMA, the company's chain restaurant distribution subsidiary.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements regarding SYSCO's ability to achieve its long-term performance objectives, maintain consistent future growth and continue to deliver sound results, inflationary trends, capital expenditures and other future investments, the expected benefits of cost controls, and the expected timing, cost and benefits of the national supply chain project and northeast redistribution center. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management's current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially. Those risks and uncertainties that could impact these statements include the risks relating to the foodservice distribution industry's relatively low profit margins and sensitivity to general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and consumer spending; the risk that higher costs due to inflation cannot be passed on to customers or that the current high levels of inflation do not return to historical levels; SYSCO's leverage and debt risks; the successful completion of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies; the risk of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, work stoppages or otherwise; construction schedules; management's allocation of capital and the timing of capital purchases such as fleet and equipment; competitive conditions; labor issues; and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2003 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. - more - - 7 -

COMPARATIVE SUPPLEMENTAL STATISTICAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SALES (UNAUDITED) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2003, sales growth for fiscal 2004 is not comparable to the prior year. In order to provide a more comparable picture of sales growth during fiscal 2004, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by estimating the impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for the fiscal 2004 periods presented are adjusted by one-fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter. Failure to make these adjustments might cause investors to overstate the amount of actual sales growth due to the additional week of sales included in the 2004 periods. Set forth below is a reconciliation of actual year-over-year sales growth to adjusted year-over-year sales growth: Comparative fourth quarter fiscal 2004 and 2003 sales adjusted for a 13-week vs. 13-week comparison.
