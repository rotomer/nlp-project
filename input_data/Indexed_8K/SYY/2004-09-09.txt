The Plan provides that the committee of the Board of Directors of Sysco Corporation (the "Corporation") which administers the Plan (the "Committee"), or its designees, may waive any vesting requirements set forth herein and may impose additional conditions to vesting of this option after the date of this option. 4. Please note that your option is nontransferable and may be exercised in part or in whole only if the conditions set forth in the Plan and herein have been fulfilled. Your stock option is in all respects limited and conditioned as provided in the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Your option will normally terminate on the earlier of (i) the date of the expiration of the option or (ii) the 90th day after severance of your employment relationship with the Corporation or any operating subsidiary or division of the Corporation ("Operating Company") for any reason, for or without cause. Whether an authorized leave of absence, or an absence for military or government service, constitutes severance of your employment relationship with the Corporation or Operating Company will be determined by the Committee at the time of the event. However, if before the expiration of your option, your employment relationship with the Corporation or Operating Company terminates as a result of your retirement in good standing or disability under the established rules of the Corporation then in effect, your option will remain in effect, vest and be exercisable in accordance with its terms as if you remained an employee of the Corporation or Operating Company. Generally, under current tax law, if you exercise your option more than three months after retirement for age or more than one year after retirement for disability, the tax treatment accorded incentive stock options will not apply. (b) In the event of your death during the term of your option, all unvested options will vest immediately and your option may be exercised by your estate, or by the person to whom such right devolves from you by reason of your death, at any time within one year after the date of your death or seven years after the date of grant, whichever date occurs first. 5.

At the time or times when you wish to exercise your options, you are asked to follow the procedures established by the Corporation for the exercise of options which will be provided to you from time to time. In order to exercise your options through attestation, you must use shares that you have held for at least six months prior to exercise and that have not been used to exercise any other option during such six-month period.
