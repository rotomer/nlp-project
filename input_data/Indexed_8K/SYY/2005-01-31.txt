EXHIBIT 99.1 SYSCO [COMPANY LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SYSCO Corporation 1390 Enclave Parkway NEWS RELEASE Houston, Texas 77077-2099 (281) 584-1390 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: John M. Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO'S SECOND QUARTER DILUTED EPS RISE 5.9% TO $0.36 HOUSTON, JANUARY 31, 2005 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY), North America's leading foodservice marketer and distributor, today announced results for the second quarter ended January 1, 2005, of its fiscal year ending July 2, 2005. SECOND QUARTER FY2005 HIGHLIGHTS: - ----------------------------------- o Diluted earnings per share rose 5.9% to $0.36 compared to $0.34 in the same period last year. o Net earnings climbed 4.8% to $232.6 million vs. $222.0 million in last year's second quarter. o Sales increased 4.2% to $7.3 billion versus $7.0 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. o Acquisitions contributed 0.7% to sales growth and inflation, as measured by product cost increases, was 3.8% in the second quarter. o Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 13.71%, a 46-basis point reduction in comparison to 14.17% in the same period last year. FIRST HALF FY2005 HIGHLIGHTS: - ------------------------------- o Diluted earnings per share rose 7.7% to $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the same period last year. o Net earnings climbed 6.4% to $458.6 million vs. $430.8 million in last year's first 26 weeks. o Sales increased 4.9% to $14.9 billion versus $14.2 billion last year. o Acquisitions contributed 0.6% to sales growth and inflation, as measured by product cost increases, was 4.7% during the period. o Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 13.86%, a 40-basis point reduction in comparison to 14.26% in the same period last year. Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our associates generated sound results in the second quarter by continuing to focus on controlling expenses, implementing business review and business development strategies and by leveraging our technology systems to more efficiently and accurately serve our customers. "This quarter represented our most difficult comparisons for the year. First, we faced last year's strong 21.4 percent increase in earnings per share. Second, we were confronted by two negative calendar shifts in the quarter. This year, New Year's day, when many restaurants are closed, fell in our second quarter. Additionally, both Christmas and New Year's day, which are very low volume restaurant days, fell on a Saturday, which typically is the busiest day of the week for dining traffic. Despite those factors and continued price sensitivity in our foodservice markets, SYSCO's committed workforce generated the sales and earnings reported today." "Our operating companies continue to improve in both their efficiency and quality metrics," said Mr. Schnieders. "We are confident that they are well positioned for future growth as comparisons become easier and foodservice trends pick up." -more- 5
In reviewing the company's programs for future growth, Thomas E. Lankford, SYSCO's president and chief operating officer, added, "We are very pleased to announce that our Northeast Redistribution Center in Front Royal, Virginia is completed and receiving products. In two weeks, on February 14, that facility will begin distributing products to our broadline company near Boston, followed incrementally by 13 additional broadline companies in our Northeast region. By October, all 14 companies will be receiving scheduled products from the Northeast Redistribution Center. This project is the largest strategic undertaking in the history of SYSCO, and we are convinced that our shareholders, customers and suppliers will benefit from the distribution efficiencies and competitive advantages that it will generate." Expenditures for the National Supply Chain project were $19.5 million during the second quarter, $13.1 million of which was capitalized and the remainder of which was expensed. The implementation of the project is on time, progressing according to plan and is slightly under budget. At the end of the second quarter total expenditures on the project were $256.3 million, of which $178.6 million has been capitalized. "Last quarter we advised that start-up expenses related to the Northeast Redistribution Center would have an estimated negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05 on earnings per share (EPS) during fiscal 2005," Mr. Lankford continued. "Based on our experience to date, we now anticipate a smaller EPS impact of between $0.03 and $0.04 for fiscal 2005 and that effect will be reflected in our third and fourth quarter results. For fiscal 2006 we continue to project that the benefits of the National Supply Chain project will offset any further costs and perhaps even contribute a half-cent to EPS." During the second quarter SYSCO's total capital expenditures were approximately $105.7 million, resulting in total expenditures of $205.6 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal year 2005. The company continues to anticipate that capital spending for fiscal 2005 will be in a range of $400 to $450 million. SYSCO, the largest foodservice marketing and distribution organization in North America, provides food and related products and services to approximately 400,000 restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers, generating sales of $30.0 billion for calendar year 2004. SYSCO's operations, supported by approximately 46,000 associates, are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline foodservice distribution companies, specialty produce and custom-cut meat operations, Asian cuisine foodservice distributors, hotel supply operations and chain restaurant distribution subsidiaries.

As previously announced, SYSCO's second quarter 2005 earnings conference call will be held at 10:00 a.m. EST on Monday, January 31, 2005. A live webcast of the call, as well as a copy of this press release, will be available online at www.sysco.com. Forward-Looking Statements - -------------------------- Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements regarding SYSCO's ability to gain market share, improve operating efficiencies, leverage technology, control expenses and execute its growth strategies; capital expenditures and other future investments; industry trends; and the expected timing, cost and benefits, including the impact on earnings per share, of the national supply chain project and northeast redistribution center. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management's current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially. Those risks and uncertainties that could impact these statements include the risks relating to the foodservice distribution industry's relatively low profit margins and sensitivity to general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and consumer spending; the risk that higher costs due to inflation cannot be passed on to customers or that the current high levels of inflation do not return to historical levels; SYSCO's leverage and debt risks; the successful completion of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies; the risk of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, work stoppages or otherwise; construction schedules; management's allocation of capital and the timing of capital purchases such as fleet and equipment; competitive conditions; labor issues; and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2004 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. -more- 6
