EXHIBIT 99.1 SYSCO [COMPANY LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SYSCO Corporation NEWS RELEASE 1390 Enclave Parkway Houston, Texas 77077-2099 (281) 584-1390 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: John M. Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO'S THIRD QUARTER DILUTED EPS RISE 13.3%, SALES INCREASE 5.9% ----------------------------------------------------------------- HOUSTON, MAY 2, 2005 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY), North America's leading foodservice marketer and distributor, today announced results for the third quarter ended April 2, 2005, of its fiscal year ending July 2, 2005. THIRD QUARTER FY2005 HIGHLIGHTS: - --------------------------------- o Diluted earnings per share rose 13.3% to $0.34 compared to $0.30 in the same period last year. o Net earnings climbed 11.4% to $218.2 million vs. $195.8 million in last year's third quarter. o Sales increased 5.9% to $7.4 billion versus $7.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. o Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 1.0% to sales growth, and inflation, as measured by product cost increases, was 3.8% in the third quarter. FIRST 39 WEEKS FY2005 HIGHLIGHTS: - --------------------------------- o Diluted earnings per share rose 9.5% to $1.04 compared to $0.95 in the same period last year. o Net earnings climbed 8.0% to $676.8 million vs. $626.6 million in last year's first 39 weeks. o Sales increased 5.2% to $22.3 billion versus $21.2 billion last year. o Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.7% to sales growth, and inflation, as measured by product cost increases, was 4.4% during the period. Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "In addition to the improvement in sales growth compared to last year, we were also pleased to see sequential improvement in the rate of sales growth during the fiscal third quarter over the second quarter. We believe the foodservice operating environment is progressively gaining strength and our operating companies continued focusing on business reviews and business development with the objective of helping our customers succeed. "I am especially proud of the way our companies overcame the more difficult operating expense environment that resulted from higher fuel costs and harsh weather in the Northeast and the Midwest," he continued, noting that SYSCO's operating companies recorded a strong 20 basis-point reduction in operating expenses as a percent to sales in the third quarter. "I remain optimistic about both the direction of our industry and SYSCO's opportunity to capitalize on future sales and earnings gains," added Mr. Schnieders. "We will be growing our entire base of Customer Contact associates in the coming quarters to take advantage of our improving operating environment and further strengthen our efforts to help our customers succeed." Mr. Schnieders also noted that SYSCO benefited from a reversal of an $11.0 million accrual for an income tax contingency during the quarter. Based on additional information and supported by a third party analysis, the company believes that the tax accrual is no longer warranted. - more - -5-
Thomas E. Lankford, SYSCO's president and chief operating officer, added, "Among the most significant activities of the third quarter was the successful opening of our northeast Redistribution Center (RDC) in Front Royal, Virginia. On February 14 it shipped its first truckload to our broadline company near Boston, and to date it is supplying five of the 14 broadline companies in the Northeast Region. By the end of this month one-half of those companies will be receiving shipments from the northeast RDC. The project remains on time, on budget and is performing better than our planned projections." During the third quarter, $14 million was expensed and $5.5 million was capitalized related to the National Supply Chain Project compared to last year's third quarter when $3 million was expensed and $25 million was capitalized. Through the end of the third fiscal quarter the total amount expensed on the National Supply Chain Project was $95.7 million and the total amount capitalized was $184.1 million. "Our FreshPoint subsidiary continued to expand its distribution reach with the acquisition of a specialty produce distributor in Modesto, California, during the quarter," continued Mr. Lankford. "In terms of internal growth activity, our broadline fold-out company in Post Falls, Idaho began distributing products in April to the Spokane, Washington and surrounding foodservice markets. Going forward, our goal is to open at least three fold-out companies per year to ensure we continue achieving the efficiencies and benefits of being closer to our customers." During the third quarter SYSCO's total capital expenditures were approximately $98.8 million, resulting in total expenditures of $304.4 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal year 2005. The company now anticipates that capital spending for fiscal 2005 will be in a range of $400 to $425 million, a slight revision to the previously provided range of $400 to $450 million. "Sales continue to head in the right direction and we are committed to building on this momentum," concluded Mr. Lankford. "Our skilled and committed associates' efforts on behalf of our customers, our growth initiatives and the continued success we are experiencing from the implementation of our RDC will continue to set us apart from the competition and position SYSCO for future market share gains." SYSCO, the largest foodservice marketing and distribution organization in North America, provides food and related products and services to approximately 400,000 restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers, generating sales of approximately $30.0 billion for calendar year 2004. SYSCO's operations, supported by approximately 46,000 associates, are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline foodservice distribution companies, specialty produce and custom-cut meat operations, Asian cuisine foodservice distributors, hotel supply operations and chain restaurant distribution subsidiaries.
