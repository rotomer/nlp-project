EXHIBIT 99.1 SYSCO [COMPANY LOGO] - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SYSCO Corporation 1390 Enclave Parkway NEWS RELEASE Houston, Texas 77077-2099 (281)584-1390 FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT: John M. Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER DILUTED EPS OF $0.44 & FISCAL 2005 DILUTED EPS OF $1.47 HOUSTON, AUGUST 15, 2005 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY), North America's leading foodservice marketer and distributor, today announced sales and earnings results for the 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended July 2, 2005 as compared to last year's 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year ended July 3, 2004. FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: -------------------------- o Diluted earnings per share were $0.44, or 2.3% above the $0.43 earned in last year's 14-week fourth quarter. o Net earnings rose 1.5%, or $284.7 million vs. $280.6 million in last year's 14-week fourth quarter. o Sales were $7.98 billion compared to $8.14 billion in last year's 14-week fourth quarter. On a comparable basis, fourth quarter sales of $7.98 billion compare to last year's adjusted fourth quarter sales of $7.56 billion.(a) o Non-comparable acquisitions represented 1.0% of sales and food cost inflation, as measured by SYSCO's change in cost of goods, was 1.6%. o Operating expenses as a percent to sales were 13.55%, an 11 basis point reduction in comparison to 13.66% in the same period last year. FISCAL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS: ----------------------- o Diluted earnings per share were $1.47, a 7.3% increase over last year's $1.37. o Net earnings increased 6.0% to $961.5 million vs. $907.2 million in last year's 53-week fiscal year. o Fiscal year sales of $30.3 billion represents a 3.2% increase compared to last year's $29.3 billion in sales. On a comparable basis, fiscal year 2005 sales of $30.3 billion were approximately 5.3% higher than adjusted sales of $28.8 billion for last year.(a) o Non-comparable acquisitions represented 0.8% of sales and food cost inflation, as measured by SYSCO's change in cost of goods, was 3.5%. o Operating expenses as a percent to sales dropped 27 basis points to 13.85% compared to last year's 14.12%. (a) Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an extra week, a comparable sales figure has been provided by excluding 1/14th of the sales made during the final quarter of fiscal 2004. Refer to the reconciliation that appears after the cash flow statement for supplemental information on adjusted sales performance. Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman, chief executive officer, and president, said, "SYSCO's dedicated associates generated sales and earnings gains for the 29th consecutive year, a truly remarkable accomplishment. After adjusting for the extra week in last year's fourth quarter, nominal sales growth has remained relatively stable for the past several quarters. In addition, declining inflation has lessened the overall gross margin pressures experienced in recent quarters and has spurred underlying unit growth. This has added to the growth coming from the success and maturation of our business review processes." SYSCO's business review efforts enhance customer relationships by tailoring value-added products and services such as menu reengineering and customer loyalty programs. On a year-over-year basis, sales to those operators who have participated in business reviews increased at an average percentage rate in the mid-teens. - more - -5-
"We are pleased with the results for the quarter that were generated by our sales growth strategies," added Mr. Schnieders. "The continued expense reduction measures and distribution efficiencies at our companies were above internal projections and the companies overcame higher fuel costs in the quarter, which were 0.46 percent of sales compared to 0.33 percent of sales in last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter operating expenses as a percent of sales dropped 11 basis points and bad debt writeoffs net of recoveries for the year were a record low 0.07 percent of sales, a reflection of the strength of the restaurant industry and higher quality sales by our operating companies." Mr. Schnieders added that SYSCO continued to invest for growth during the fourth quarter, with capital expenditures of $85.8 million during the final 13 weeks of fiscal 2005, or a total of $390.2 million during the fiscal year. The company projects capital spending to be in a range of $425 million to $450 million for fiscal year 2006. During the fourth quarter, $16.9 million was expensed and $2.2 million was capitalized related to the National Supply Chain Project. Through the end of fiscal year 2005, the total amount expensed on the National Supply Chain Project since inception was $113 million and the total amount capitalized was $186 million. "The National Supply Chain project, the largest strategic project in SYSCO's history, continues to exceed our expectations," added Mr. Schnieders. "The Northeast Redistribution Center (RDC) is currently shipping to 12 of the 14 broadline operating companies in that region, with the two remaining companies scheduled to ramp up by October. Approximately 120,000 cases are currently being shipped each day from the Northeast RDC, a figure that will grow to 300,000 cases when it is fully operational in January, 2006. We also have identified a site in Florida as the location for the second RDC and expect to make a formal announcement in the near future." The acquisition of two specialty meat distributors -- Facciola Meat Company (Fremont, California) and Royalty Foods, Inc. (Orlando, Florida), were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The purchase of specialty produce distributor Fowler & Huntting Company, Inc. (Hartford, Connecticut), which was announced during the fourth quarter, was completed July 29, 2005. Construction of two fold-out operations to service the Raleigh, North Carolina and Gulf Coast Alabama markets continued to progress during the quarter, as did construction of a replacement facility in Lincoln, Illinois. A replacement facility for the Denver broadline company is currently under construction and during the fourth quarter facility expansions were completed in Baltimore, Maryland; San Diego, California; and Harrisburg, Virginia. A warehouse expansion was also performed in Modesto, California for Piranha Produce, SYSCO's recently acquired specialty produce distributor. SYSCO's income tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 includes a tax benefit of $8.5 million primarily related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on certain deferred tax assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006 SYSCO will begin expensing stock options as required under accounting guidelines. The current estimate of the impact for expensing options falls in a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share for the fiscal year 2006. SYSCO is the largest foodservice marketing and distribution organization in North America, providing food and related products and services to approximately 390,000 restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. SYSCO's operations are located throughout the United States and Canada and include broadline companies, specialty produce and custom-cut meat operations, Asian foodservice distributors, hotel supply operations and chain restaurant distribution subsidiaries.

As previously announced, SYSCO's fourth quarter 2005 earnings conference call will be held at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Monday, August 15, 2005. A live webcast of the call, as well as a copy of this press release, will be available online at www.sysco.com under Investor Relations. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements regarding capital expenditures; inflationary trends; the impact of option expensing; SYSCO's ability to increase sales, improve operating efficiencies, control expenses and execute growth strategies; and the expected timing and benefits of acquisitions, fold-outs, the national supply chain project and regional redistribution centers, including the Northeast RDC. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management's current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially. Those risks and uncertainties that could impact these statements include risks that pertain to SYSCO's business, including the risks relating to the foodservice distribution industry's relatively low profit margins and sensitivity to general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and consumer spending; SYSCO's leverage and debt risks; the successful completion of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies; the risk of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, work stoppages or otherwise; construction schedules; management's allocation of capital and the timing of capital purchases such as fleet and equipment; competitive conditions; labor issues; and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. The expected impact of option expensing is based on certain assumptions regarding the number and fair value of options granted, resulting tax benefits and shares outstanding. The actual impact of option expensing could vary significantly to the extent actual results vary significantly from assumptions. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2004 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. - more - -6-

COMPARATIVE SUPPLEMENTAL STATISTICAL INFORMATION RELATED TO SALES (UNAUDITED) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Comparative SYSCO Brand Sales and Marketing Associate-Served Sales data for the 13-weeks and 14-weeks of the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 are summarized below. Because the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 contained an additional week as compared to fiscal 2005, sales levels for fiscal 2005 are not directly comparable to the prior fiscal year. In order to provide a more comparable picture of sales during fiscal 2005 relative to fiscal 2004, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust the sales figures for fiscal 2004 by estimating the impact of the additional week. As a result, sales for the fiscal 2004 periods presented below are reduced by one-fourteenth of total sales for the fourth quarter. Failure to make these adjustments might cause investors to understate the amount of actual sales change due to the additional week of sales included in the 2004 periods. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the actual year-over-year sales increase (decrease) to adjusted year-over-year sales increase: Comparative fourth quarter fiscal 2005 and 2004 sales for a 13-week vs. adjusted 13-week comparison. # # # -11-
