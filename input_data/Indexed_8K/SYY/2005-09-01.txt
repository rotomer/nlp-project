ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. Fiscal 2005 Annual Incentive Compensation On August 26, 2005, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee (the "Committee") of Sysco Corporation ("SYSCO") certified satisfaction of the performance criteria and payment of bonuses under the fiscal 2005 incentive program which was adopted May 13, 2004 by the Committee pursuant to the 2000 Management Incentive Plan (the "2000 MIP"). Bonuses under the fiscal 2005 incentive program to the Named Executive Officers, as defined below, will be paid as soon as practicable. On August 9, 2005, the Committee determined that the performance of Mr. Schnieders, SYSCO's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, exceeded expectations based on its annual review using the criteria set forth in the Supplemental Performance-Based Bonus Plan (the "Supplemental Plan") and the agreement entered into February 22, 2005 thereunder. The Committee also determined that, as a result, Mr. Schnieders would be entitled to a Supplemental Bonus (as defined in the Supplemental Plan) equal to 18% of any base bonus earned for fiscal 2005 as calculated pursuant to the 2000 MIP. The amounts paid under the 2000 MIP and the Supplemental Plan to the executive officers who will be named in the Summary Compensation Table in the proxy statement for SYSCO's annual meeting of stockholders to be held November 11, 2005 (the "Named Executive Officers") are set forth below: (1) Excludes matching amounts credited to participant accounts under the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP") with respect to any amounts of a MIP bonus that were deferred.
