The options will vest 20% per year beginning September 8, 2006. The exercise price is $33.01 per share, and the expiration date is September 7, 2012. The form of option grant agreement is filed with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein. The options were granted to the Named Executive Officers in the following amounts: Grant of Units Under 2004 Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan On September 8, 2005, performance units were granted to the Named Executive Officers under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Cash Plan (the "Long-Term Plan") for the performance period commencing July 3, 2005 and ending June 28, 2008. Participants under the Long-Term Plan will not be entitled to any bonus pursuant to these awards unless certain performance criteria are met. The bonus opportunities for the fiscal 2006-2008 performance period are composed of two components: one based on achievement of specified increases in net after-tax earnings per share ("Component A"), and one based on achievement of specified increases in sales, defined as GAAP sales less product cost inflation, or plus product cost deflation, as measured by SYSCO's change in cost of goods ("Component B"). 2
A. Earnings Growth Component (Component A). If the Company achieves certain net after-tax earnings increases, award recipients will earn a bonus under this component without regard to whether a bonus was earned under Component B. The amount of any bonus earned under Component A will be calculated according to the following formula: ------------------- ------ ------------- ------ ----------------------- Number of X Unit Value X Applicable Percentage A Performance Units Granted to Participant ------------------- ------ ------------- ------ ----------------------- B. Sales Growth Component (Component B). If the Company achieves certain increases in sales, defined as GAAP sales less product cost inflation, or plus product cost deflation, as measured by SYSCO's change in cost of goods, award recipients will earn a bonus under this component without regard to whether a bonus was earned under Component A. The amount of any bonus earned under Component B will be calculated according to the following formula: ------------------- ------ ------------- ------ ----------------------- Number of X Unit Value X Applicable Percentage B Performance Units Granted to Participant ------------------- ------ ------------- ------ ----------------------- The "Unit Value" for the September 8, 2005 grants was set at $35. "Applicable Percentage A" ranges from 25% to 75%, depending upon the amount of the increase in net after-tax earnings, if any.

When exercised, all or a portion of this Option may be an incentive stock option, governed by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This option is granted without Stock Appreciation Rights. By accepting this Option, you accept and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Plan and Terms and Conditions of Stock Option, and you acknowledge receipt of the Plan dated November 12, 2004 and the Prospectus dated _____________________.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK OPTION 1. Please carefully review all the provisions of the Sysco Corporation 2004 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"). In addition to the conditions set out in the Plan, the exercise of your option is contingent upon satisfying the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 2. ____________ of the total number of shares covered by your option will vest each year for __________ years, as follows. This option will expire at the close of business on __________________. 3. The vested portion of your option may be exercised at any time after it vests, provided that at the time of the exercise all of the conditions set forth in the Plan and in this document have been met. No portion of your option may be exercised prior to _________________. The Plan provides that the committee of the Board of Directors of Sysco Corporation (the "Corporation") which administers the Plan (the "Committee"), or its designees, may waive any vesting requirements set forth herein and may impose additional conditions to vesting of this option after the date of this option. 4. Please note that your option is nontransferable and may be exercised in part or in whole only if the conditions set forth in the Plan and herein have been fulfilled. Your stock option is in all respects limited and conditioned as provided in the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Your option will normally terminate on the earlier of (i) the date of the expiration of the option or (ii) the 90th day after severance of your employment relationship with the Corporation or any operating subsidiary or division of the Corporation ("Operating Company") for any reason, for or without cause. Whether an authorized leave of absence, or an absence for military or government service, constitutes severance of your employment relationship with the Corporation or Operating Company will be determined by the Committee at the time of the event. However, if before the expiration of your option, your employment relationship with the Corporation or Operating Company terminates as a result of your retirement in good standing or disability under the established rules of the Corporation then in effect, your option will remain in effect, vest and be exercisable in accordance with its terms as if you remained an employee of the Corporation or Operating Company. Generally, under current tax law, if you exercise your option more than three months after retirement for age or more than one year after retirement for disability, the tax treatment accorded incentive stock options will not apply. (b) In the event of your death during the term of your option, all unvested options will vest immediately and your option may be exercised by your estate, or by the person to whom such right devolves from you by reason of your death, at any time within three years after the date of your death or seven years after the date of grant, whichever date occurs first. 5. Optionee acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained herein shall be deemed an offer of employment to Optionee, a contract of employment or a promise of continued employment by or with the Corporation or any Operating Company. 6. At the time or times when you wish to exercise your options, you are asked to follow the procedures established by the Corporation for the exercise of options which will be provided to you from time to time. In order to exercise your options through attestation, you must use shares that you have held for at least six months prior to exercise and that have not been used to exercise any other option during such six-month period.
