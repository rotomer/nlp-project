The term "Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of the Underwriters and to an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives.

If so specified, the Underwriters will endeavor to make such arrangements, and as compensation therefor the Company will pay to the Representatives, for the accounts of the Underwriters, at the Time of Delivery (as defined in Section 4 hereof), such commission, if any, as may be set forth in such Pricing Agreement. Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, are to be with investors of the types described in the Prospectus and subject to other conditions therein set forth. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts. The principal amount of Contract Securities to be deducted from the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter as set forth in Schedule I to the Pricing Agreement applicable to such Designated Securities shall be, in each case, the principal amount of Contract Securities which the Company has been advised by the Representatives have been attributed to such Underwriter, provided that, if the Company has not been so advised, the amount of Contract Securities to be so deducted shall be, in each case, that proportion of Contract Securities which the principal amount of Designated Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter under such Pricing Agreement bears to the total principal amount of the Designated Securities (rounded as the Representatives may determine). The total principal amount of Underwriters' Securities to be purchased by all the Underwriters pursuant to such Pricing Agreement shall be the total principal amount of Designated Securities set forth in Schedule I to such Pricing Agreement less the principal amount of the Contract Securities. The Company will deliver to the Representatives not later than 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding the Time of Delivery specified in the applicable Pricing Agreement (or such other time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing), a written notice setting forth the principal amount of Contract Securities. 4. Underwriters' Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter pursuant to the Pricing Agreement relating thereto, in the form specified in such Pricing Agreement, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice to the Company, shall be delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Representatives for the account of such Underwriter, against payment by such Underwriter or on its behalf of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of Federal (same-day) funds to the account specified by the Company to the 10
Representatives at least forty-eight hours in advance or at such other place and time and date as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing, such time and date being herein called the "Time of Delivery" for such Securities. Concurrently with the delivery of and payment for the Underwriters' Securities, the Company will deliver to the Representatives for the accounts of the Underwriters a check payable to the order of the party designated in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities in the amount of any compensation payable by the Company to the Underwriters in respect of any Delayed Delivery Contracts as provided in Section 3 hereof and the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities. 5. The Company agrees with each of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities: (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the execution and delivery of the Pricing Agreement relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to such Securities and prior to the Time of Delivery for such Securities which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery (other than any amendment to the Registration Statement that is filed with the Commission more than one year after such Time of Delivery and that does not relate to the offering or sale of the Designated Securities) and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after they receive notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith, the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction; 11
(c) Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus, excluding documents filed electronically with the Commission and incorporated by reference therein, in New York City as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; (d) To furnish to counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, a signed copy (which may be a complete and accurate photocopy of a signed original) of the Registration Statement and three conformed copies (including exhibits thereto) and, for delivery to each other Underwriter, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto), in each case prior to the first Time of Delivery under the Agreement; (e) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158); (f) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including the later of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery and which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without the prior written consent of the Representatives; (g) If the Company elects to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Company shall file a Rule 462(b) Registration Statement with the Commission in compliance with Rule 462(b) by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement, and the Company shall at the time of filing either pay to the Commission the filing fee for the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement or give irrevocable instructions for the payment of such fee pursuant to Rule 111(b) under the Act; 12
(h) Not to be or become, at any time prior to the expiration of three years after the Time of Delivery, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust, closed-end investment company or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act; and (i) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds." 6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, any Pricing Agreement, any Indenture, any Delayed Delivery Contracts, any Blue Sky and Legal Investment Memoranda, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky and Legal Investment Surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of any Trustee and any agent of any Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for any Trustee in connection with any Indenture and the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder and under any Delayed Delivery Contracts which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make. 7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions: (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; if the Company has elected to rely upon Rule 462(b), the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have become effective by 10:00 P.M., Washington, D.C. time, on the date of this Agreement; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no 13
proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representatives' reasonable satisfaction; (b) Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may request to enable them to pass upon such matters; (c) Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, counsel for the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex III, which opinion must be in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives. If the Offered Securities include Delayed Delivery Contracts, such opinion shall also address due authorization, execution and deliver of, the enforceability of, and the absence of conflicts in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of, the Delayed Delivery Contracts; (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated Securities, at a time prior to the execution of the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities, and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent accountants, shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter dated as of the date of the Pricing Agreement and a letter dated as of such Time of Delivery, respectively, to the effect set forth in Annex IV hereto and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives; (e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended prior to the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Underwriters' Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; (f) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or preferred stock by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such 14
organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or preferred stock; (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the Designated Securities, there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company's securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal, New York or Texas State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis or any change in financial, political or economic conditions in the United States or elsewhere, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Underwriters' Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as first amended or supplemented relating to the Designated Securities; (h) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(c) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and (i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. 8. (a)The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in 15
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such Securities. (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received 16
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 9. (a)If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Underwriters' Securities, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to 17
procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Underwriters' Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Underwriters' Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities. (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Underwriters' Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Underwriters' Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Underwriters' Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default. 10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf 18
of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. 11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but, if for any other reason, other than pursuant to Sections 7(g)(i), (iii), (iv) or (v) hereof, Underwriters' Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof. 12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof. 13. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters or the counterparty or counterparties to the Delayed Delivery Contracts, as the case may be, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 14. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 8 and 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this 19
Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase. 15. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business. 16. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE UNDERWRITERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 17. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 18. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment. 19. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 20
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us one for the Company and for each of the Representatives plus one for each counsel counterparts hereof.

ANNEX III [Form of Opinion of Counsel for the Company] __________, 20__ Goldman, Sachs & Co., [Names of Co-Representative(s), c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co.,] 85 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004. Ladies and Gentlemen: We are furnishing this opinion letter to you under Section 7(c) of the Underwriting Agreement dated as of September 19, 2005 by and between SYSCO Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "Original Agreement"), which is incorporated by reference into the Pricing Agreement dated as of __________, 20__ between the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. [and __________], as Representative[s] for the several underwriters referred to below (the "Pricing Agreement," and together with the Original Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreement"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I of the Pricing Agreement (the "Underwriters") of $__________ aggregate principal amount of ___% __________ due __________, 20__ (the "Securities"). The Company will issue the Securities under an Indenture dated as of June 15, 1995 between it and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly First Union National Bank of North Carolina), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by __________ supplemental indentures (such indenture as so amended and supplemented being herein referred to as the "Original Indenture") and as further amended and supplemented by the __________ Supplemental Indenture dated as of __________, 20__ relating to the offering of the Securities (the "Supplemental Indenture"). The Original Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are collectively referred to herein as the "Indenture." Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings given to them in the Underwriting Agreement. The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 33-124166) relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance therewith, of debt securities of the Company, including the Securities. The registration statement, including exhibits thereto, as amended at the time of its effective date, including all documents incorporated by reference therein, is hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement," and the Company's prospectus dated May 9, 2005, together with the Company's prospectus supplement dated __________, 20__, as filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, including all documents incorporated by reference therein, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Prospectus." We have examined the originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, each as amended to date, of the Company (the "Charter
Documents"), the Prospectus, the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, [a form of Delayed Delivery Contract,] the Securities, corporate records of the Company and its subsidiaries, including minute books the Company has furnished to us, certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company, statutes and other instruments and documents, as a basis for the opinions we hereinafter express. In giving these opinions, we have relied on certificates of officers of the Company and of public officials with respect to the accuracy of the factual matters those certificates cover or contain, and we have assumed that all signatures on documents we have examined are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies conform to the original copies of those documents and those original copies are authentic. In giving this opinion, we have also relied on the following assumptions: A. Each of the individuals executing the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") has requisite legal capacity and all the signatures on the Transaction Documents are genuine. B. The execution and delivery of each and all of the Transaction Documents are free from any form of fraud, misrepresentation, mistake of fact, duress or criminal activity, none of which has occurred insofar as we are aware. C. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee to the extent required and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Trustee enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, and the Trustee has all requisite corporate power and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to enforce the Indenture. D. The Trustee has all requisite governmental certifications of authority, licenses, permits, consents, qualifications and documents, if any, to perform its obligations under the Indenture, and to enforce the Indenture. We have made no investigation of the facts or law underlying the foregoing assumptions, and you have not requested us to do so, but we wish to advise you that nothing has come to our attention which would provide us with actual knowledge that we are not justified in making such assumptions. On the basis of the foregoing and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications we set forth herein, we are of the following opinions: 1. The Company has been organized and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus. The Company has been qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in any such jurisdiction is not reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 2. The authorized capital stock of the Company is comprised of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Common Stock"), and 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share III-2
("Preferred Stock"). No shares of Preferred Stock have been issued. All the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. 3. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Indenture, and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms. The Indenture conforms, as to legal matters, in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus. 4. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act"). 5. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Securities, and [the Securities have been duly authorized and executed by the Company and, when duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities will have been duly authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture / the Securities have been duly authorized; the Underwriters' Securities have been duly executed by the Company and, when duly authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities will have been duly authenticated, issued and delivered and constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture; the Contract Securities, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered pursuant to the Indenture and Delayed Delivery Contracts and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture]; and the Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus. 6. The Company has the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. [7. Each of such Delayed Delivery Contracts has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming such Contract has been duly executed and delivered by the purchaser named therein, constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms; and any Delayed Delivery Contracts conform to the description thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented.] 8. The issue and sale of the Securities by the Company to the Representative[s] and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, [each of the Delayed Delivery Contracts,] and the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument (a) to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the III-3
Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject and (b) that has been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to any document that has been incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the Charter Documents or the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the federal laws of the United States; 9. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Representative[s] contained in the Underwriting Agreement and its/their compliance with its/their obligations set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture [or any of such Delayed Delivery Contracts], except such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Representative[s]. 10. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending its effectiveness has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose are pending before or threatened by the Commission. Any filing of the Prospectus required by Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act has been timely made in accordance with that rule. 11. We do not know of any pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries that are required to be disclosed in the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, which are not disclosed in the Prospectus. 12. To our knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which are reasonably likely to individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others. 13. The statements set forth in the Prospectus (a) under the caption "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Securities, and (b) in paragraphs _____ under the caption "Plan of Distribution" and in paragraphs _____ under the caption "Underwriting," in each case insofar as they purport to describe or summarize the provisions of the laws and documents referred to therein, are accurate, complete and fair. 14. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus none of them will be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 15. None of the Company's transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Securities) will violate or result in a violation of Section 7 of the Exchange Act, or any regulation promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. III-4
16. To our knowledge, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any other person granting such person the right to require the Company to include the offering of any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person in the offering registered pursuant to the Registration Statement. 17. To our knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (a) in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or similar governing documents, (b) in default, and no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound or (c) in violation of any law or statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for any such defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 18. To our knowledge, the Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses, franchises, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by, and have made all declarations and filings with, the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign governmental or regulatory agencies or bodies ("Permits") that are necessary for the ownership or lease of their respective properties or the conduct of their respective businesses as described in the Prospectus, except where the failure to possess or make the same would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. To our knowledge, except as described in the Prospectus, the Company and its subsidiaries have fulfilled and performed all their obligations with respect to such Permits, and no event has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time, or both, would allow, revocation or termination thereof or result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Permit, except for any such failures to fulfill and perform or such revocations, terminations or impairments that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. 19. The Registration Statement, as of the date of the filing of the Company's __________ with the Commission, and the Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, were appropriately responsive in all material respects as to form to the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, or any statement or representation in any of the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1). 20. The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, as of their respective filing dates, were appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act (except that in each case we do not express any view as to the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial information included or incorporated by reference therein or excluded therefrom, or any statement or representation in any of the exhibits thereto). III-5
We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Prospectus (for the avoidance of doubt, the word "Prospectus" as used in this paragraph shall include the documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus) and related matters were discussed. Although we have not undertaken to determine independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Prospectus (except to the extent set forth in paragraph 13 above), we advise you that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that the Prospectus (other than (a) the financial statements and schedules (including the notes thereto and the auditor's reports thereon) incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and (b) the other accounting and financial information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Our opinions expressed in Paragraphs 3, 5 [and 7] hereinabove are expressly subject to the following exceptions and qualifications in addition to other exceptions and qualifications set forth elsewhere herein: (a) The effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors. This includes the effect of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in its entirety, including matters of contract rejection, fraudulent conveyance and obligation, turn-over, preference, equitable subordination, automatic stay, conversion of a non-recourse obligation into a recourse obligation, and substantive consolidation. This also includes laws regarding fraudulent transfers, obligations and conveyances, and state receivership laws. (b) The effect of general principles of equity, whether applied by a court of law or equity. (c) With respect to the Indenture, the possible unenforceability of provisions that waivers or consents by a party may not be given effect unless in writing or in compliance with particular requirements or that a person's course of dealing, course of performance, or the like or failure or delay in taking actions may not constitute a waiver of related rights or provisions or that one or more waivers may not under certain circumstances constitute a waiver of other matters of the same kind. (d) The effect of course of dealing, course of performance, or the like, in modifying the terms of the Indenture or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder. (e) To the extent that the validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Indenture or the Securities or any provisions contained therein depends upon the application of governing state law in a jurisdiction or jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction whose law is the governing law, regardless of whether the same has been enacted in the jurisdiction(s) where the rights or remedies provided by governing state law are asserted, we do not opine that a court in any such other jurisdiction would apply governing state law to such terms or provisions. (f) A judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction outside the state whose law is the governing law may not be enforceable in such state if such judgment is deemed to contravene the public policy of such state. III-6
In this letter, references to federal statutes include all amendments thereto and all rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, in each case as in effect on the date hereof. In this letter, phrases such as "to our knowledge," "known to us" and those with equivalent wording refer to the awareness of information by the lawyers of this Firm who have prepared or signed this letter or been actively involved in assisting and advising the Company in connection with the preparation of the Prospectus and the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, without any independent investigation by any lawyer of this Firm. Except as otherwise expressly stated above, we limit our opinions in this letter in all respects to matters of the laws of the States of New York and Georgia and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We are furnishing this letter to you solely for your use in connection with the transactions consummated on the date hereof under the Underwriting Agreement, and this letter may not be relied on by any other person or for any other purpose. This letter speaks as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to update it or advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein. Very truly yours, ARNALL GOLDEN GREGORY LLP III-7

Indenture and in this Eighth Supplemental Indenture and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is mutually covenanted and agreed as follows: ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION 1.1 Definitions. Each capitalized term that is used herein and is defined in the Original Indenture shall have the meaning specified in the Original Indenture unless that term is otherwise defined herein. 1.2 Section References. Each reference to a particular section set forth in this Eighth Supplemental Indenture shall, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to this Eighth Supplemental Indenture. ARTICLE II TITLE AND TERMS OF SECURITIES 2.1 Title of the Securities. This Eighth Supplemental Indenture hereby establishes a series of Securities designated as the "5.375% Senior Notes due September 21, 2035" of the Company (collectively referred to herein as the "Notes"). For purposes of the Original Indenture, the Notes shall constitute a single series of Securities. 2.2 Term of the Notes. The Notes shall mature on September 21, 2035 (the "Stated Maturity"). In the event that the Stated Maturity of any Note is not a Business Day, principal and interest payable at maturity shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day with the same effect as if that Business Day were the Stated Maturity and no interest shall accrue or be payable for the period from and after the Stated Maturity to the next succeeding Business Day. 2.3 Amount and Denominations; Currency of Payment. The aggregate principal amount in which the Notes may be issued under this Eighth Supplemental Indenture is limited to $500,000,000. The Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Registered Global Securities in the name of Cede & Co., as registered owner and nominee for The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York ("DTC"). DTC shall initially act as Depositary for the Notes. The Notes shall be denominated in United States dollars in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. 2.4 Interest and Interest Rates. Each Note shall bear interest at the rate of 5.375% per annum from the date of issue or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined in Section 2.5 below) to which interest on such Note has been paid or duly provided for, commencing with the Interest Payment Date next succeeding the date of issue, until the principal thereof is paid or made available for payment. Interest shall be payable to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date (as defined in Section 2.5 below) next preceding an Interest Payment Date. 2
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Note is originally issued after the Regular Record Date and before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the first payment of interest on the Note shall be made on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name that Note was registered on the Regular Record Date with respect to such next succeeding Interest Payment Date. Interest on each Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprising twelve 30-day months. 2.5 Interest Payments. The interest payment dates for each Note shall be March 21 and September 21, in each year (the "Interest Payment Dates"), beginning March 21, 2006 and the regular record dates shall be the March 1 and September 1 (the "Regular Record Dates") preceding those Interest Payment Dates, respectively. Interest shall also be payable at maturity of any Note. If an Interest Payment Date with respect to the Notes would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day with respect to the Notes and no interest shall accrue or be payable on such next succeeding Business Day for the period from and after such original Interest Payment Date to such next succeeding Business Day. Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, interest payments shall be in the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, the Interest Payment Date. 2.6 Place of Payment, Transfer and Exchange. The Company authorizes and appoints the Trustee as the sole paying agent (the "Paying Agent") with respect to any Notes represented by Registered Global Securities, without prejudice to the Company's authority to appoint additional paying agents from time to time pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Original Indenture. Payments of principal on each Note and interest thereon payable at maturity or upon redemption shall be made in immediately available funds in such currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, at the request of the Holder, at the office or agency of the Paying Agent in New York, New York or any other duly appointed Paying Agent, provided that the Note is presented to the Paying Agent in time for the Paying Agent to make the payments in immediately available funds in accordance with its normal procedures. So long as any Notes are represented by a Registered Global Security, interest (other than interest payable at maturity or upon redemption) shall be paid in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Depositary for such Notes, on the written order of the Depositary. In addition, the Company may maintain a drop agent, in such location or locations as the Company may select, to provide the Holders with an office at which they may present the Notes for payment. The Company hereby acknowledges that any drop agent maintained will accept Notes for presentment, take payment instructions from the Holder and forward the Notes presented and any related payment instructions to the Paying Agent by overnight courier, for next day delivery. Notes presented as set forth in the previous sentence shall be deemed to be presented to the Paying Agent on the Business Day next succeeding the day the Notes are delivered to the drop agent. Payment of interest (other than interest payable in accordance with 3
the preceding provisions of this subsection (i)) will, subject to certain exceptions provided in the Indenture, be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register as of the applicable Regular Record Date or, at the option of the Company, by wire transfer to an account maintained by such Person with a bank located in the United States. The Company appoints the Trustee as the sole Security registrar with respect to the Notes, without prejudice to the Company's authority to appoint additional Security registrars from time to time pursuant to Section 2.8 of the Original Indenture. The Notes may be presented by the Holders thereof for registration of transfer or exchange at the office or agency of the Security registrar or any successor or co-registrar in New York, New York. In addition, the Company may maintain a drop agent, in such location or locations as the Company may select, to provide the Holders with an office at which they may present the Notes for registration of transfer or exchange. The Company hereby acknowledges that any drop agent maintained by the Company will accept Notes for registration of transfer or exchange and forward those Notes to the Security registrar by overnight courier, for next day delivery. Notes accepted as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be presented to the Security registrar on the Business Day next succeeding the day that Notes are delivered to the drop agent. 2.7 No Sinking Fund. The Notes shall not be subject to any sinking fund. 2.8 Redemption at Option of the Company. The Notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to the Stated Maturity, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to the greater of the following amounts, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of redemption: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed; or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of the principal of and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points.

"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, the average of two Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for that redemption date. "Quotation Agent" means Goldman, Sachs & Co. or its successor. 4
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Goldman, Sachs & Co. or its successor and (2) one other firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer") which the Company specifies from time to time; provided, however, that if any of them ceases to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to a particular Reference Treasury Dealer and a particular redemption date, the average, as calculated by the Trustee, of the bid and asked price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding that redemption date. "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15 (519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the maturity date of the Notes, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined, and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release or any successor release is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue, expressed as a percentage of its principal amount, equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated as of 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the date of redemption to each holder of Notes to be redeemed. If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as the Trustee shall deem appropriate and fair, the particular Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on or after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. 2.9.

The acceptance of this Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement of the Holder hereof to all the terms and conditions of the Indenture. This Note is a Security of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000. If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Events of Default are defined in the Indenture and generally include: (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the Securities; (ii) default in any payment of principal on any of the Securities when due and payable; (iii) failure on the part of the Company duly to observe or perform any of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Company in the Securities or in the Indenture which shall not have been remedied within 90 days after written notice by the Trustee or by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby; or (iv) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each such affected series of then Outstanding Securities (voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal of all Securities of all such affected series, and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be immediately due and payable, except that, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company, the principal and interest on the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder. Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected (with all such series voting as a single class) at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by the Indenture, provided that the Trustee may decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee determines the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in good faith shall A-7
so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interest of Holders of the Securities of all series so affected not joining in the giving of said direction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their best interests. The Indenture requires the Company to furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holders for one or more of the following purposes (as more particularly set forth in the Indenture): (1) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property or assets to the Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series; (2) to evidence the succession of another entity to the Company; (3) to add to the covenants of the Company or add Events of Default for the benefit of Holders; (4) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision of the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision of the Indenture, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture as shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect; (5) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of the Indenture; and (6) to evidence the appointment of a successor Trustee. The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of each series to be affected (voting as a single class). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as a single class), on behalf of the Holders of all such Securities, to waive certain past defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note. Without the consent of each Holder of each Note so effected, the Company may not extend the final maturity of any Note, or reduce the rate (or alter the method of computation) or interest thereon or extend the time for payment thereof, or reduce (or alter the method of computation of) any amount payable on redemption or repayment thereof or extend the time for payment thereof, or make the principal thereof or interest thereon (including any amount in respect of original issue discount) payable in any coin or currency other than that A-8
provided in the Notes or in accordance with the terms thereof, or reduce the amount that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity of any Note, or impair or affect the right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof.

SYSCO will issue the Notes under an Eighth Supplemental Indenture anticipated to be dated September 22, 2005 (the "Supplemental Indenture") between SYSCO, as Issuer, and Wachovia Bank, National Association (formerly First Union National Bank of North Carolina), as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Supplemental Indenture will be entered into in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture dated as of June 15, 1995 between SYSCO and the Trustee. For purposes of the opinions we express below, we have examined, among other agreements, instruments and documents, the following: o the restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of SYSCO; o the Registration Statement and its exhibits; o the prospectus the Registration Statement includes; o the prospectus supplement dated September 19, 2005;

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes will, when they have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, and duly purchased and paid for in accordance with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement be duly authorized and validly issued, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of SYSCO, enforceable against SYSCO in accordance with their terms, except as that enforcement is subject to (a) any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (b) general principles of equity, regardless of whether that enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and (c) any implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing.
