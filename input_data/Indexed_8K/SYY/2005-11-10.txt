ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On November 4, 2005, SYSCO Corporation ("SYSCO"), a Delaware corporation, and Sysco International, Co., a Nova Scotia unlimited liability company and SYSCO's wholly owned subsidiary ("Sysco International"; together with SYSCO, "Borrowers"), entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of lenders ("Lenders"). This Credit Agreement replaces the Company's previous credit facility, which was contemporaneously terminated. The parties to the Credit Agreement apart from the Borrowers are described below: o JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (U.S. Administrative Agent); o JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch (Canadian Administrative Agent); o Bank of America, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., SunTrust Bank, Wachovia Bank, National Association (Co-Syndication Agents); o Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and TD Securities (USA) LLC (Co-Documentation Agents); o J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (Sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger); o J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., SunTrust Bank, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., Wachovia Bank, NA, Congress Financial Corporation (Canada), The Bank of New York, Comerica Bank, The Northern Trust Company, PNC National Association, The Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto-Dominion (Texas) LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Financial Corporation Canada, Williams Street Commitment Corporation, and Zions First National Bank (Lenders). Borrowings by Sysco International under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by SYSCO. Neither SYSCO nor any of its affiliates has any material relationship with any of the other parties to the Credit Agreement apart from SYSCO's ownership of Sysco International, the Borrowers' previous credit facilities, ordinary banking relationships, service by Wachovia Bank, N.A., as Trustee under SYSCO's Senior Notes Indenture, and service from time to time by affiliates of Wachovia Bank, N.A., and JP Morgan Chase Bank as underwriters or initial purchasers in offerings of SYSCO securities. Borrowings. The Credit Agreement generally provides for a 5-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings in the following amounts and forms: o up to a maximum of U.S. $400 million, by SYSCO (the "U.S. Facility"), in the form of loans denominated in U.S. dollars, with a $75 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $50 million swingline subfacility; plus o up to a maximum of U.S. $100 million, in the aggregate, to both Borrowers (the "Canadian Facility"), in the form of loans or bankers' acceptances denominated in Canadian dollars. 2
Under certain circumstances more particularly described in the Credit Agreement, the U.S. Facility and Canadian Facility may be increased in the aggregate to a maximum amount of $1 billion. No letter of credit is available if the expiration date is later than five business days prior to the termination date of the Credit Agreement. The maturity date of all borrowings under the Credit Agreement is November 4, 2010, subject to extension under certain circumstances. Interest Rates - U.S. Facility. Borrowings under the U.S. Facility bear interest at one of the following two rates, at SYSCO's election: 1. the "Alternate Base Rate"; or 2. with respect to any Eurodollar borrowings, "Adjusted LIBO Rate" plus the "Applicable Rate." 1. The "Alternate Base Rate." The "Alternate Base Rate" is equal to the greater of the following: o JP Morgan Chase Bank's "prime rate" for that day, at its principal office in New York City, New York; and o A fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate plus .5%. 2. "Adjusted LIBO Rate" Plus "Applicable Rate" The "Adjusted LIBO Rate" (with respect to any Eurodollar borrowing) is the "LIBO Rate" times the "Statutory Reserve Rate," which are calculated as follows: o The "LIBO Rate" is generally the rate that appears on Page 3750 of the Dow Jones Market Service two business days prior to the commencement of the interest-bearing period. If the Dow Jones rate is unavailable at the appropriate time, then the LIBO Rate will instead be the rate which the principal London office of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. would offer in the London interbank market for deposits of US$5 million with a maturity equal to the interest-bearing period. o The "Statutory Reserve Rate" is a fraction (expressed as a decimal), the numerator of which is the number one and the denominator of which is the number one minus the aggregate of maximum reserve percentages established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States of America. The "Applicable Rate" varies between .13% and .35%, based upon the then-current ratings by S&P and Moody's to SYSCO's senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness. 3
Interest Rates - Canadian Facility. Borrowings under the Canadian Facility bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the Borrower's election: 1. the "Canadian Alternate Base Rate"; or 2. with respect to borrowings represented by a bankers' acceptance, the "Discount Rate" applicable to the purchase of the acceptance by the relevant Lender, plus the Applicable Rate. 1. Canadian Alternate Base Rate The "Canadian Alternate Base Rate" is generally the greater of the following: o the rate publicly announced by the Canadian Administrative Agent as its reference rate for determining interest rates applicable to commercial loans denominated in Canadian Dollars in Canada; and o the average discount rate applicable to bankers' acceptances, denominated in Canadian Dollars, with a term of 30 days appearing on the Reuters Screen CDOR Screen (the "CDOR Rate"), plus .5% (except that if the CDOR Rate is not reported on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page, it will be replaced by an average of certain rate quotes for bankers' acceptances with a term of 30 days received by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch). 2. Discount Rate The "Discount Rate," for acceptances by certain Canadian Lenders who are listed on Schedule I to the Canadian Bank Act, equals the CDOR Rate applicable to that acceptance (except that if the CDOR Rate is not reported on the Reuters Screen CDOR Page, it will be replaced by an average of certain rate quotes received by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch). For acceptances by other Canadian Lenders, the Discount Rate will equal the lesser of: o the CDOR Rate applicable to that acceptance, plus .1%; and o the average of certain rate quotes received by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch. Financial Covenants and Events of Default The Credit Agreement contains covenants substantially the same as under the Company's previous credit facility, including financial covenants relating to the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio. Events of Default under the Credit Agreement are also substantially the same as under the Company's previous credit facility. 4
Indemnification The Borrowers are obligated to indemnify the Lenders under certain circumstances related to the use of the credit facilities, under terms substantially similar to the Company's previous credit facility. Use of Proceeds Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are limited to general corporate purposes of SYSCO and its subsidiaries, including commercial paper back-up and acquisitions. Draw-downs There are no amounts owing under the Credit Agreement. ITEM 1.02. TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL CONTRACT. The Credit Agreement described under Item 1.01 above replaced SYSCO's previous U.S. credit facility used to support its commercial paper program (as well as Sysco International's previous Canadian facility). There were no amounts outstanding under the previous credit facilities. The previous U.S. facility was evidenced by a Credit Agreement dated September 13, 2002, between SYSCO and a syndicate of lenders led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, provided for maximum borrowings up to $450 million, and was scheduled to mature in 2007. The Company has not incurred any material early termination penalties, and does not have any material relationships with any of the parties thereto apart from their relationships as lenders to the Company and as disclosed elsewhere in this Form 8-K. For further information, see the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis contained in SYSCO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended July 2, 2005.

The parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I Definitions SECTION 1.01 Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings specified below: "ABR", when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to whether such Loan, or the Loans comprising such Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate. "Acquisition" has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.08. "Adjusted LIBO Rate" means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate. "Administrative Questionnaire" means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form supplied by an Agent. "Affiliate" means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified. "Agents" means the U.S. Administrative Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent. "Alternate Base Rate" means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greater of (a) the U.S. Prime Rate in effect on such day (or, in the case of Loans or Borrowings made by the Canadian Lenders pursuant to the Canadian Commitments denominated in U.S. Dollars, the rate per annum announced from time to time by the Canadian Administrative Agent as its U.S. base rate in effect at its office in Toronto) and (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the U.S. Prime Rate, the U.S. base rate in effect in Toronto or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of such change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively. 1
"Applicable Agent" means (a) with respect to a Loan or Borrowing made by the Company, and with respect to any payment hereunder that does not relate to a particular Loan or Borrowing, the U.S. Administrative Agent, and (b) with respect to a Loan or Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars or B/A, the Canadian Administrative Agent. "Applicable Percentage" means (a) with respect to any U.S. Lender, the percentage of the aggregate U.S. Commitments represented by such Lender's U.S. Commitment or (b) with respect to any Canadian Lender, the percentage of the aggregate Canadian Commitments represented by such Lender's Canadian Commitment. If the U.S. Commitments or Canadian Commitments, as applicable, have terminated or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon the U.S. Commitments or Canadian Commitments, as applicable, most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments. "Applicable Rate" means, for any day, with respect to any Eurodollar Revolving Loan or B/A Drawing, or with respect to the facility fees payable hereunder, as the case may be, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption "Eurodollar/ B/A Spread" or "Facility Fee Rate", as the case may be, based upon the ratings by S&P and Moody's, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt: INDEX DEBT RATINGS FACILITY FEE RATE EURODOLLAR/B/A SPREAD ------------------ ----------------- --------------------- Category 1 AA- or higher by S&P Aa3 or higher by Moody's 0.04% 0.13% Category 2 A+ by S&P A1 by Moody's 0.05% 0.15% Category 3 A by S&P A2 by Moody's 0.06% 0.19% Category 4 A- by S&P A3 by Moody's 0.07% 0.28% Category 5 BBB+ or lower by S&P Baa1 or lower by Moody's 0.10% 0.35% For purposes of the foregoing, (i) if either S&P or Moody's shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this definition), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 5; (ii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by S&P and Moody's for the Index Debt shall fall within different Categories, the Applicable Rate shall be based on the higher of the two ratings, i.e., that appearing in the numerically lower Category, unless one of the two ratings is two or more Categories lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the 2
Category next below that of the higher of the two ratings; and (iii) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by S&P and Moody's for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of S&P or Moody's), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished by the Company to the Agents and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01 or otherwise. Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of S&P or Moody's shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrowers and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation. "Assignment and Assumption" means an assignment and assumption entered into by a Lender and an assignee (with the consent of any party whose consent is required by Section 10.04), and accepted by an Agent, in the form of Exhibit A or any other form approved by an Agent. "Attributable Debt" means, with respect to any Sale and Leaseback Transaction not giving rise to Capital Lease Obligations, as of any date of determination, the total obligation (discounted to present value at the rate of interest implicit in the lease included in such transaction) of the lessee for rental payments (other than amounts required to be paid on account of property taxes, maintenance, repairs, insurance, assessments, utilities, operating and labor costs and other items which do not constitute payments for property rights) during the remaining portion of the term (including extensions which are at the sole option of the lessor) of the lease included in such transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any lease subject to a Sale and Leaseback Transaction which is (or by its express terms will at some future date become) terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty in a fixed amount, or in an amount which, as of such date of determination, is mathematically determinable with respect to the then earliest date upon which such lease may be so terminated (the "earliest termination date"), the lessee's rental obligation under such lease may at the Company's election be either (i) determined in accordance with the preceding sentence (disregarding the amount of any such termination penalty), or (ii) the sum of (a) the lessee's obligation (discounted, as aforesaid) for rental payments, if any, during the portion of the term ending on the earliest termination date, plus (b) the amount of such penalty (similarly discounted if, as of the date of determination, the earliest termination date has not yet occurred). "Augmenting Lender" has the meaning assigned to such term in Section 2.20(a).

"Borrower" means the Company or the Canadian Borrower. "Borrowing" means (a) Revolving Loans of the same Class and Type, made, converted or continued on the same date and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, as to which a single Interest Period is in effect, (b) where the context requires, a B/A Drawing, or (c) a Swingline Loan.

Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. SECTION 2.04. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans in U.S. Dollars to the Company from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding US$50,000,000 or (ii) the total U.S. Revolving Credit Exposures exceeding the total U.S. Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan; and provided further, that the Swingline Lender shall not make a Swingline Loan if a Default has occurred and is continuing. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans. (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Company shall notify the U.S. Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by telecopy), not later than 2:30 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan.

Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which U.S. Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the U.S. Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each U.S. Lender, specifying in such notice such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each U.S. Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the U.S. Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each U.S. Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the U.S. Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each U.S. Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to U.S. Revolving Loans made by such U.S. Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the U.S. Lenders), and the U.S. Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the 24
amounts so received by it from the U.S. Lenders.

Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Company (or other party on behalf of the Company) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the U.S. Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the U.S. Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the U.S. Administrative Agent to the U.S. Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the U.S. Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Company of any default in the payment thereof. SECTION 2.05. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the U.S. Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period and the Issuing Bank hereby agrees to issue such Letters of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Company to, or entered into by the Company with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the U.S. Administrative Agent (three days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, the Company also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed US$75,000,000 and (ii) the total U.S. Revolving Credit Exposures shall not exceed the total U.S. Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit if a Default has occurred and is continuing. 25
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the U.S. Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each U.S. Lender, and each U.S. Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each U.S. Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the U.S. Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each U.S. Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the U.S. Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. (e) Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the U.S. Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Company prior to such time on such date, then not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Company receives notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Company receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than US$10,000, the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR U.S. Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Company's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR U.S. Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the U.S. Administrative Agent shall notify each U.S. Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each U.S. Lender shall pay to the U.S. Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to U.S. Revolving Loans made by such U.S. Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the U.S. Lenders), and the U.S. Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the U.S. Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the U.S. Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, 26
the U.S. Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that U.S. Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such U.S. Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a U.S. Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR U.S. Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a U.S. Revolving Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. (f) Obligations Absolute. The Company's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company's obligations hereunder. Neither any Agent, any Lender nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the 27
U.S. Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the U.S. Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. (h) Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Company reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR U.S. Revolving Loans; provided that, if the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any U.S. Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such U.S. Lender to the extent of such payment. (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the U.S. Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall notify the U.S. Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(c). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the U.S. Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the U.S. Revolving Loans has been accelerated, U.S. Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the U.S. Administrative Agent, in the name of the U.S. Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the U.S. Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and the amount of such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company described in clause (h) or (i) of Section 7.01. Such deposit shall be held by the U.S. Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall have exclusive 28
dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the U.S. Administrative Agent and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the U.S. Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the U.S. Revolving Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of U.S. Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. SECTION 2.06. Funding of Borrowings and B/A Drawings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it and disburse the Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) of each B/A to be accepted and purchased by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 2:00 p.m., Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans or disburse the Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the general deposit account of the applicable Borrower maintained with the Applicable Agent (i) in New York City, in the case of Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars and (ii) in Toronto, in the case of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars or B/As, and designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, provided that ABR U.S. Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the U.S. Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing or acceptance and purchase of B/As that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees), the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) available to the Applicable Agent, then such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of (x)(A) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, in the case of Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars and (B) the rate determined by the Canadian Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount, 29
in the case of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, and (y) a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable to such Borrowing or the applicable Discount Rate, as the case may be. If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing or such Lender's purchase of B/As. SECTION 2.07. Bankers' Acceptances. (a) Each acceptance and purchase of B/As of a single Contract Period pursuant to Section 2.01(b) or Section 2.08 shall be made ratably by the Canadian Lenders in accordance with the amounts of their Canadian Commitments. The failure of any Canadian Lender to accept any B/A required to be accepted by it shall not relieve any other Canadian Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Canadian Commitments are several and no Canadian Lender shall be responsible for any other Canadian Lender's failure to accept B/As as required. (b) The B/As of a single Contract Period accepted and purchased on any date shall be in an aggregate amount that is at least equal to the Borrowing Minimum and is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple. If any Canadian Lender's ratable share of the B/As of any Contract Period to be accepted on any date would not be an integral multiple of Cdn.$100,000, the face amount of the B/As accepted by such Lender may be increased or reduced to the nearest integral multiple of Cdn.$100,000 by the Canadian Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. B/As of more than one Contract Period, but not more than 10 Contract Periods, may be outstanding at the same time. (c) To request an acceptance and purchase of B/As, the Canadian Borrower shall notify the Canadian Administrative Agent of such request by telephone or by telecopy not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of such acceptance and purchase. Each such request shall be irrevocable and, if telephonic, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Canadian Administrative Agent of a written request in a form approved by the Canadian Administrative Agent and signed by the Canadian Borrower. Each such telephonic and written request shall specify the following information: (i) the aggregate face amount of the B/As to be accepted and purchased; (ii) the date of such acceptance and purchase, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) the Contract Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Contract Period" (and which shall in no event end after the Maturity Date); and (iv) the location and number of the Canadian Borrower's account to which the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06. If no Contract Period is specified with respect to any requested acceptance and purchase of B/As, then the Canadian Borrower shall be deemed to have selected a Contract Period of 30 days' duration. 30
Promptly following receipt of a request in accordance with this paragraph, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall advise each Canadian Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of B/As to be accepted and purchased by such Lender. (d) The Canadian Borrower hereby appoints each Canadian Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf, manually or by facsimile or mechanical signature, as and when deemed necessary by such Lender, blank forms of B/As, each such Lender hereby agreeing that it will not sign or endorse B/As in excess of those required in connection with B/A Drawings that have been requested by the Canadian Borrower hereunder. It shall be the responsibility of each Canadian Lender to maintain an adequate supply of blank forms of B/As for acceptance under this Agreement. The Canadian Borrower recognizes and agrees that all B/As signed and/or endorsed on its behalf by any Canadian Lender shall bind the Canadian Borrower as fully and effectually as if manually signed and duly issued by authorized officers of the Canadian Borrower. Each Canadian Lender is hereby authorized to issue such B/As endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by such Lender; provided that the aggregate face amount thereof is equal to the aggregate face amount of B/As required to be accepted by such Lender. No Canadian Lender shall be liable for any damage, loss or claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such instrument unless such loss or improper use results from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender. Each Canadian Lender shall maintain a record with respect to B/As (i) received by it from the Canadian Administrative Agent in blank hereunder, (ii) voided by it for any reason, (iii) accepted and purchased by it hereunder and (iv) canceled at their respective maturities. Each Canadian Lender further agrees to retain such records in the manner and for the periods provided in applicable provincial or federal statutes and regulations of Canada and to provide such records to the Canadian Borrower upon its request and at its expense. Upon request by the Canadian Borrower, a Canadian Lender shall cancel all forms of B/A that have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of the Canadian Borrower and that are held by such Canadian Lender and are not required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement. (e) Drafts of the Canadian Borrower to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be signed as set forth in paragraph (d) above. Notwithstanding that any Person whose signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any of the Canadian Lenders or Canadian Borrower at the date of issuance of such B/A, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed and properly completed shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower. (f) Upon acceptance of a B/A by a Canadian Lender, such Lender shall purchase such B/A from the Canadian Borrower at the Discount Rate for such Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of such Canadian Borrower as provided in Section 2.06. The acceptance fee payable by the Canadian Borrower to a Canadian Lender under Section 2.12 in respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the Discount Proceeds payable by such 31
Lender under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any B/A Drawing resulting from the conversion or continuation of a B/A Drawing or Canadian Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.08, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to the Canadian Borrower by each Canadian Lender pursuant to this paragraph will be applied as provided in Section 2.08(f). (g) Each Canadian Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/A's accepted and purchased by it. (h) Each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder shall mature at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto. (i) The Canadian Borrower waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Canadian Lender in respect of a B/A accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right and the Canadian Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as holder sues the Canadian Borrower on the B/A for payment of the amounts payable by the Canadian Borrower thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Canadian Borrower shall pay the Canadian Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A, and after such payment the Canadian Borrower shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A. (j) At the option of the Canadian Borrower and any Canadian Lender, B/As under this Agreement to be accepted by that Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada) or bills of exchange pursuant to the Bills of Exchange Act (Canada). All depository bills so issued and bills of exchange shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 2.07. (k) If a Canadian Lender is not a bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Canadian Lender notifies the Canadian Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept B/As, such Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing B/As, make a Loan (a "B/A Equivalent Loan") to the Canadian Borrower in the amount and for the same term as each draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Lender will provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the Canadian Borrower in the same manner as such Lender would have provided the Discount Proceeds in respect of the draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would result if such Lender had accepted (and been paid an acceptance fee) and purchased (at the applicable Discount Rate) a B/A for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Canadian Lenders and the Canadian Borrower as the B/A that such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such 32
interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and will be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan in the same amount and manner in which the deduction based on the Discount Rate and the applicable acceptance fee of a B/A would be deducted from the face amount of the B/A. Subject to the repayment requirements of this Agreement, on the last day of the relevant Contract Period for such B/A Equivalent Loan, the Canadian Borrower shall be entitled to convert each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another type of Loan, or to roll over each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another B/A Equivalent Loan, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement. (l) Notwithstanding any provision hereof but subject to Section 2.11(b), the Canadian Borrower may not prepay any B/A Drawing other than on the last day of its Contract Period. (m) For greater certainty, all provisions of this Agreement which are applicable to B/As shall also be applicable, mutatis mutandis, to B/A Equivalent Loans. SECTION 2.08. Interest Elections and Contract Periods. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Each B/A Drawing shall have a Contract Period as specified in the applicable request therefor. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing or B/A Drawing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing or B/A Drawing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section, it being understood that no B/A Drawing may be converted or continued other than at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto. The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing or B/A Drawing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing or accepting the B/As comprising such B/A Drawing, as the case may be, and any Loans or B/As resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing or B/A Drawing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no Borrowing or B/A Drawing may be converted into or continued as a Borrowing or B/A Drawing with an Interest Period or Contract Period ending after the Maturity Date. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telephone (i) in the case of an election that would result in a Borrowing, by the time and date that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election, and (ii) in the case of an election that would result in a B/A Drawing or the continuation of a B/A Drawing, by the time and date that a request would be required under Section 2.07 if such Borrower were requesting an acceptance and purchase of B/As to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form reasonably acceptable to the Applicable Agent and signed by the applicable 33
Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, (i) neither Borrower shall be permitted to change the Borrower or currency of any Borrowing, and (ii) each conversion or continuation of a Borrowing shall comply with the applicable provisions of Section 2.02. (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: (i) the Borrowing or B/A Drawing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing, a Eurodollar Borrowing, a Canadian Alternate Base Rate Borrowing or a B/A Drawing; and (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period", and in the case of an election of a B/A Drawing, the Contract Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Contract Period". If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing or a B/A Drawing but does not specify an Interest Period or Contract Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period or Contract Period of one month's or 30 days' duration, as applicable. (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each participating Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing. (e) If the relevant Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing or B/A Drawing prior to the end of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing or B/A Drawing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period or Contract Period, such Borrowing or B/A Drawing shall (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars, be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing or B/A Drawing denominated in Canadian Dollars, be converted to a Canadian Alternate Base Rate Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the U.S. Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing, (ii) unless 34
repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) no outstanding Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars may be converted to or continued as a B/A Drawing and (iv) unless repaid, each B/A Drawing shall be converted to a Canadian Alternate Base Rate Borrowing at the end of the applicable Contract Period thereto. (f) Upon the conversion of any Canadian Borrowing (or portion thereof), or the continuation of any B/A Drawing (or portion thereof), to or as a B/A Drawing, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to the Canadian Borrower by each Canadian Lender pursuant to Section 2.07(f) in respect of such new B/A Drawing shall be applied against the principal of the Canadian Revolving Loan made by such Canadian Lender as part of such Canadian Revolving Borrowing (in the case of a conversion), or the reimbursement obligation owed to such Canadian Lender under Section 2.07(i) in respect of the B/As accepted by such Lender as part of such maturing B/A Drawing (in the case of a continuation), and such Borrower shall pay to such Lender an amount equal to the difference between the principal amount of such Canadian Revolving Loan or the aggregate face amount of such maturing B/As, as the case may be, and such net amount. SECTION 2.09. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of either Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of US$5,000,000 and not less than US$20,000,000, or the entire amount of the Commitments of such Class, (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the U.S. Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the U.S. Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the total U.S. Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total U.S. Commitments, and (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Canadian Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Canadian Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the total Canadian Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Canadian Commitments. (c) The Company shall notify the U.S. Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments of either Class under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the U.S. Administrative Agent shall advise the Canadian Administrative Agent and the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the U.S. Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of either Class shall be permanent, subject, however, to the Company's right to increase the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.20. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class. 35
SECTION 2.10. Repayment of Loans and B/As; Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay on the Maturity Date, to the Applicable Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Lender to such Borrower. The Canadian Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay on the Maturity Date, to the Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, the face amount of each B/A, if any, accepted by such Lender as provided in Section 2.07. The U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the 15th day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that on each date that a U.S. Revolving Borrowing is made, the Company shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding. (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made or B/A accepted by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (c) The U.S. Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, and the amount of each B/A and the Contract Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal, interest or other amount in respect of any B/A due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agents hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. The Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly provide the U.S. Administrative Agent with all information needed to maintain such accounts in respect of the Loans or B/A Drawings administered by such Agent. (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of either Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the U.S. Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). SECTION 2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section. 36
(b) If on any Reset Date, the total Canadian Revolving Credit Exposures exceed 105% of the total Canadian Commitments, then one or both of the Borrowers shall, within three Business Days after receiving notice thereof from the Canadian Administrative Agent, prepay one or more of their respective Canadian Borrowings in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce the total Canadian Revolving Credit Exposures to an amount that does not exceed the total Canadian Commitments; provided, however, that neither Borrower shall be obligated to prepay any B/A in order to comply with the terms of this Section 2.11(b); provided, further, that should a prepayment of all outstanding Canadian Borrowings be insufficient to reduce the Canadian Revolving Credit Exposures below 105% of the total Canadian Commitments, the Canadian Borrower shall provide cash collateral to the Canadian Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient to secure the outstanding B/As to the extent necessary to comply with this paragraph (b) (and such collateral will be held by the Canadian Administrative Agent and applied to pay B/As as and when due). (c) The applicable Borrower shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR U.S. Revolving Borrowing or a Canadian Alternate Base Rate Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof, to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.10, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.10. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Applicable Agent shall advise the relevant Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13. SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the U.S. Administrative Agent, in U.S. Dollars, for the account of each applicable Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the U.S. Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused) and the Canadian Borrower agrees to pay to the Canadian Administrative Agent, in U.S. Dollars, for the account of each applicable Lender a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the Canadian Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused), in each case such fee shall accrue during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if any such Lender continues to have any Class of Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment of such Class terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure of such Class from and including the date on which its Commitment of such Class terminates to but excluding the date 37
on which such Lender ceases to have any Revolving Credit Exposure of such Class. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and, with respect to Commitments of either Class, on the date on which the Commitments of such Class terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any facility fees accruing, with respect to a Class of Revolving Credit Exposure, after the date on which the Commitments of such Class terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (b) The Canadian Borrower agrees to pay to the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the account of each Canadian Lender, on each date on which B/As drawn by the Canadian Borrower are accepted hereunder, in Canadian Dollars, an acceptance fee equal to (i) the product of the Applicable Rate and the face amount of each B/A accepted by such Lender multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Contract Period applicable to such B/A and the denominator of which is 365. (c) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the U.S. Administrative Agent for the account of each U.S. Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such U.S. Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment terminates and the date on which such U.S. Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the U.S. Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the U.S. Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the U.S. Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (d) A utilization fee shall accrue at the rate of 0.05% per annum on the daily amount of the Revolving Credit Exposure of each Lender at all times when the total Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds 50% of the total Commitments. To the extent such utilization fee accrues on the Revolving Credit Exposures represented by Canadian Alternate Base Rate Loans or B/As, such portion of the utilization fee shall be paid by the Canadian Borrower in Canadian Dollars, and 38
the balance of such utilization fee shall be paid by the Company in U.S. Dollars. Accrued utilization fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any utilization fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All utilization fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). (e) The Company agrees to pay to the U.S. Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the U.S. Administrative Agent. (f) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the U.S. Administrative Agent (or (i) to the Canadian Administrative Agent, in the case of fees payable under paragraph (d) above that are payable in Canadian Dollars or fees payable under paragraph (e) above, or (ii) to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees, participation fees and utilization fees, to the relevant Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate. The Loans comprising each Canadian Alternate Base Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the Canadian Alternate Base Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by either Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section, (ii) in the case of any other amount payable in Canadian Dollars, 2% plus the rate applicable to Canadian Alternate Base Rate Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or (iii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans of either Class, upon termination of the Commitments of such Class; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR U.S. Revolving Loan or Canadian Alternate Base Rate Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Revolving Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period 39
therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Canadian Alternate Base Rate or to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the U.S. Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Canadian Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (f) Whenever interest is calculated on the basis of a year of 360 or 365 days, for the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest which is equivalent to the rate payable hereunder is the rate payable multiplied by the actual number of days in the year and divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be. All interest will be calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method and the deemed reinvestment principle shall not apply to such calculations. SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing: (a) the U.S. Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or (b) the U.S. Administrative Agent is advised by a majority in interest of the Lenders of the Class participating in such Borrowing that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; then the U.S. Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company, the Lenders and the Canadian Administrative Agent, if applicable, by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the U.S. Administrative Agent notifies the Company, the Lenders and the Canadian Administrative Agent, if applicable, that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type or Class of Borrowings, then the other Type or Class of Borrowings shall be permitted. SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall: 40
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or of obtaining funds for the purchase of B/As (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to accept and purchase B/As) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or to the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, as the case may be, for any such reduction actually suffered. (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay or cause the Canadian Borrower to pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change 41
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan or to issue B/As for acceptance and purchase on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or the right to receive payment in respect of a B/A other than on the last day of the Interest Period or Contract Period, as the case may be, applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19 or the CAM Exchange, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each affected Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of either Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if either Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Applicable Agent, each affected Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) In addition, the applicable Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 42
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify each Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of either Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by an Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the U.S. Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the U.S. Administrative Agent. (e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower to whom a Lender has made a Loan is organized or resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the U.S. Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (f) If an Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by either Borrower or with respect to which either Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Company (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by either Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, that the Company, upon the request of such Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Agent or such Lender in the event the such Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require any Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to either Borrower or any other Person. SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without 43
set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent at such account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify in a notice delivered to the applicable Borrower, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Canadian Loan denominated in Canadian Dollars or amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing (or of any breakage indemnity or utilization fees in respect of any such Loan or B/A Drawing) shall be made in Canadian Dollars; all other payments hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars, except as otherwise expressly provided. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to any Agent from either Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder by such Borrower, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, amount owing in respect of any B/A Drawings or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawings or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawings and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by either Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or 44
participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. (d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to such Agent for the account of the Lenders or applicable Class thereof or the Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in U.S. Dollars) or (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated in Canadian Dollars). (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d), then the Applicable Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Applicable Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if either Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) either Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder or (iv) any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender under Section 2.21, then the Company may, at 45
its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the U.S. Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the U.S. Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the applicable Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. SECTION 2.20. Increase in Commitments. (a) The Company may, on behalf of itself or the Canadian Borrower, by written notice to the U.S. Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders and the Canadian Administrative Agent), request that the total Commitments of either Class be increased by an amount not less than US$10,000,000 for any such increase; provided that after giving effect to any such increase the sum of the total Commitments shall not exceed US$1,000,000,000 minus any amount by which the Commitments shall have been reduced pursuant to Section 2.09. Such notice shall set forth (i) whether such increase in Commitments shall apply to the U.S. Commitments or Canadian Commitments, (ii) the amount of the requested increase in such Commitments, (iii) the date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days or more than 60 days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each U.S. Lender (in the case of a requested increase in U.S. Commitments) or Canadian Lender (in the case of a requested increase in Canadian Commitments) the opportunity to increase its Commitment of the applicable Class, by its Applicable Percentage of the proposed increased amount. Each such Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the U.S. Administrative Agent given not more than 10 days after the date of the Company's notice, either agree to increase its applicable Commitment, by all or a portion of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing being an "Increasing Lender") or decline to increase its applicable Commitment (and any such Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of 10 days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its applicable Commitment) (each such Lender so declining or deemed to have declined being a "Non-Increasing Lender"). In the event that, on the 10th day after the Company shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, the applicable Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their applicable Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the total Commitments of the applicable Class requested by the Company, the Company may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution being called an "Augmenting Lender"), which may include any Lender, to extend Commitments of the applicable Class or increase their existing Commitments of the applicable Class in an aggregate amount equal 46
to the unsubscribed amount; provided that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the U.S. Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Company and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the U.S. Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence its Commitment and/or its status as a Lender hereunder. Any increase in the total Commitments may be made in an amount which is less than the increase requested by the Company if the Company is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Lenders. (b) On the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") of any increase in the total Commitments of either Class pursuant to this Section 2.20 (the "Commitment Increase"), (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans of the same Class outstanding (the "Initial Loans") immediately prior to giving effect to the Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be paid, (ii) each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender that shall have been a Lender prior to the Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings (as hereinafter defined) and (B) the product of (1) such Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans, (iii) each Augmenting Lender that shall not have been a Lender prior to the Commitment Increase shall pay to the Applicable Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the product of (1) such Augmenting Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, and (iv) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clauses (ii) and (iii) above, the Applicable Agent shall pay to each Non-Increasing Lender the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference between (A) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Initial Loans and (B) the product of (1) such Non-Increasing Lender's Applicable Percentage (calculated after giving effect to such Commitment Increase) multiplied by (2) the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (v) after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, the applicable Borrower or Borrowers shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the "Subsequent Borrowings") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of its or their Initial Loans and of the types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Applicable Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (vi) each Non-Increasing Lender, each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Applicable Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) and (vii) the applicable Borrower or Borrowers shall pay each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on its or their Initial Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (i) above in respect of each Eurodollar Loan shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto and breakage costs result. 47
(c) Increases and new Commitments of either Class created pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date specified in the notice delivered by the Company pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph (a) above. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the total Commitments of a Class (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or addition of a new Lender shall become effective under this Section unless, (i) on the date of such increase, (A) the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct on and as of such date (unless expressly made as of another date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such other date), (B) on such date and immediately after giving effect to such increase, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the U.S. Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company, and (C) the Commitment of each Lender of the applicable Class (without giving effect to any merger of Lenders after the date of this Agreement) is equal to or less than 20% of the total Commitments of such Class, and (ii) the U.S. Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date under clauses (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of the applicable Borrower or Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase (or, if such documents delivered on the Effective Date already contemplate an increase in an amount at least equal to the amount of such increase, stating that such documents remain in full force and effect on the date of such increase and have not in anywise been annulled, modified, rescinded or revoked). SECTION 2.21. Extension of Maturity Date. (a) The Company may by written notice (an "Extension Notice") delivered to the U.S. Administrative Agent not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days prior to an anniversary of the Effective Date request an extension of the Maturity Date to a date no later than 12 months after the Existing Maturity Date (as defined below) as specified in such Extension Notice (an "Extension"), provided that (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of the Extension Notice or the Existing Maturity Date and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III shall be true and correct in all material respects as if made on the date of such Extension Notice and the Existing Maturity Date, and (iii) the U.S. Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate, dated the Existing Maturity Date and signed by the Chief Executive Officer, President, a Vice President or a Financial Officer of the Company, confirming compliance with the conditions precedent set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (a). (b) The effectiveness of any Extension shall require the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, each Lender participating in such Extension and each Agent. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall promptly furnish a copy of the Extension Notice to each Lender, and shall request that each Lender either agree to such extension or not agree thereto within 30 days of delivery to such Lender of the Extension Notice. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Extension hereunder shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Lender that has declined to agree to any requested Extension (a "Non-Consenting Lender") shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such Extension (the "Existing Maturity Date"), and the principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by such Lender, together with any accrued interest thereon, and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or 48
for the account of such Lender hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date and such Lender shall be released from its participation in such Letter of Credit effective on the Existing Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, (i) the Company shall have the right, pursuant to Section 2.19(b), to replace a Non-Consenting Lender with a Lender or other financial institution that will agree to an Extension and (ii) the Company shall have the right, any time prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to withdraw its request for an extension of the Maturity Date by written notice to the U.S. Administrative Agent, in which case the Commitments of all the Lenders will terminate on the Existing Maturity Date. ARTICLE III Representations and Warranties The Company represents and warrants to the Lenders that: SECTION 3.01. Organization; Powers. The Company and each Subsidiary is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted, and is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is required and where the failure so to qualify (either individually or together with all other failures so to qualify) could have a Material Adverse Effect.

(a) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property material to its business, except for defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes. (b) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Company and each such Subsidiary does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person. SECTION 3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of either Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Company or any Subsidiary (i) as to which there is a reasonable likelihood of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions. (b) Except with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability. SECTION 3.07. Subsidiaries. Set forth on Schedule 3.07, as most recently supplemented from time to time as hereinbelow provided in this Section 3.07, is a complete and accurate list (as of the date hereof or as of the date as of which information is presented in such supplement, as the case may be) of all Subsidiaries showing (as to each such Subsidiary) the correct name thereof and the jurisdiction of its organization or formation. All the outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and, to the extent owned directly or indirectly by the Company, are so owned free and clear of all Liens not permitted by Section 6.01. The Canadian Borrower is a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company. It is agreed that each Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company after the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a supplement to Schedule 3.07 updating the information therein contained to the date as of which information is presented in such Annual Report on Form 10-K. 50
SECTION 3.08. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing. SECTION 3.09. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

SECTION 3.11. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans by an amount that, if required to be paid by the Borrower, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.12. Disclosure. Neither the Information Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Company to any Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(g) any other event or condition occurs that results in any Material Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or requiring the prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its scheduled maturity; provided that this clause (g) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such Indebtedness; (h) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an involuntary petition shall be filed seeking (i) liquidation, reorganization or other relief in respect of either Borrower or any Subsidiary which is a "significant subsidiary" within the meaning of Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (a "Significant Subsidiary"), or its debts, or of a substantial part of its assets, under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect or (ii) the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for either Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, and, in any such case, such proceeding or petition shall continue undismissed for 60 days or an order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered; (i) either Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary shall (i) voluntarily commence any proceeding or file any petition seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, (ii) consent to the institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any proceeding or petition described in clause (h) of this Article, (iii) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, sequestrator, conservator or similar official for either Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary or for a substantial part of its assets, (iv) file an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such proceeding, (v) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (vi) take any action for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; (j) either Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary shall become unable, admit in writing its inability or fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; (k) one or more judgments for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of US$50,000,000 shall be rendered against the Company, any Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall remain undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary to enforce any such judgment; (l) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; or (m) the Canadian Borrower shall cease to be a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary at any time prior to termination of the Canadian Commitments and payment in full of all outstanding Canadian Revolving Loans and B/As; 62
then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to either Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the U.S. Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrowers, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding, and declare an amount equal to the full face amount of all outstanding B/As, to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal or other amount not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans and an amount equal to the full face amount of all such outstanding B/As so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to either Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower. SECTION 7.02. CAM Exchange. (a) On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Section 7.01, (ii) each U.S. Lender shall immediately be deemed to have acquired participations in the Swingline Loans in an amount equal to such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of each Swingline Loan outstanding on such date and shall promptly make payment therefor to the U.S. Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c), (iii) simultaneously with the automatic conversions pursuant to clause (iv) below, the Lenders shall automatically and without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 10.04) be deemed to have exchanged interests in the Loans (other than the Swingline Loans) and B/As and participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit, such that in lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Loan, B/A and Letter of Credit in which it shall participate as of such date (including such Lender's interest in the Specified Obligations of each Borrower in respect of each such Loan, B/A and Letter of Credit), such Lender shall hold an interest in every one of the Loans (other than the Swingline Loans) and B/As and, a participation in every one of the Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit (including the Specified Obligations of each Borrower in respect of each such Loan and each Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 7.03 below), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage thereof, (iv) simultaneously with the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, all outstanding Canadian Revolving Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into U.S. Dollars, determined using the Exchange Rate calculated as of the Business Day immediately preceding the CAM Exchange Date, and on and after such date all such Loans shall constitute ABR Loans payable in U.S. Dollars and (v) immediately upon the date of expiration of the Contract Period in respect thereof, the Specified Obligations in respect of each B/A received in the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iii) above shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into U.S. Dollars, determined 63
using the Exchange Rate calculated as of such date, and on and after such date all such Specified Obligations shall be payable in U.S. Dollars and bear interest at the rate applicable to ABR Loans hereunder. It is understood and agreed that Lenders holding interests in B/As on the CAM Exchange Date shall discharge the obligations to fund such B/As at maturity in exchange for the interests acquired by such Lenders in funded Loans in the CAM Exchange. Each Lender and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any Person that acquires a participation in its interests in any Loan or B/A or any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit. Each Borrower agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the U.S. Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the U.S. Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the U.S. Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans and B/As so executed and delivered; provided, that the failure of either Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange. (b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by either Agent pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Specified Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender on or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of a Specified Obligation shall be paid over to the Applicable Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith. SECTION 7.03. Letters of Credit. (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any L/C Disbursement shall not have been reimbursed by the Company or with the proceeds of a U.S. Revolving Loan or Swingline Borrowing, each U.S. Lender shall promptly pay over to the U.S. Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in U.S. Dollars equal to such U.S. Lender's Applicable Percentage of such undrawn face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such unreimbursed drawing, as applicable, together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the U.S. Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR U.S. Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such undrawn face amount or unreimbursed drawing, as applicable. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account (each, a "Reserve Account") for each Lender for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall deposit in each such Lender's Reserve Account such Lender's CAM Percentage of the amounts received from the U.S. Lenders as provided above. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over each Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each Reserve Account shall be held in such Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided below in this Section. The U.S. Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each such 64
Lender's Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against the LC Exposures, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against either Borrower and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of either Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.04. (b) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit, the U.S. Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Issuing Bank, withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender any amounts, up to the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment, deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts to the Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the U.S. Lenders under Section 2.05(d) (but not of the Company under Section 2.05(e)). In the event that any U.S. Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the U.S. Administrative Agent in respect of any Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 7.03, the Issuing Bank shall have a claim against such U.S. Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.05(d), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the Company's reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 7.02. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting U.S. Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the event that such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount. (c) In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the U.S. Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender. (d) With the prior written approval of the U.S. Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and the Issuing Bank, any Lender may withdraw the amount held in its Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the U.S. Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment. (e) Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the U.S. Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the U.S. Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its amounts in its Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (d) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the U.S. Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the U.S. Administrative Agent with amounts in its Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account. 65
ARTICLE VIII Guarantee In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Canadian Borrower hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Canadian Borrower (the "Guaranteed Obligations"). The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Guaranteed Obligation. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to the Canadian Borrower of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee hereunder and notice of protest for nonpayment. The Company's guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against either Borrower under the provisions of this Agreement; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation. The Company further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of the Canadian Borrower or any other Person. The guarantee of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. The Company further agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Canadian Borrower or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Canadian Borrower to pay any Guaranteed 66
Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Guaranteed Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation shall be due in Canadian Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the U.S. Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Guaranteed Obligation in U.S. Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Canadian Administrative Agent and any Canadian Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against the Canadian Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations owed by the Canadian Borrower to the Agents and the Lenders. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations. ARTICLE IX The Agents Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoint the U.S. Administrative Agent and Canadian Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to each such Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The bank serving as the U.S. Administrative Agent and the bank serving as the Canadian Administrative Agent hereunder shall each have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and each such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder. The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) neither Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) neither Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, 67
except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances provided in Section 10.02) and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and neither Agent shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any Subsidiary that is communicated to or obtained by such bank serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by a Borrower or a Lender, and neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for either Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor as provided in this paragraph, either Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, if such successor bank is the U.S. 68
Administrative Agent, or Toronto, if such successor bank is the Canadian Administrative Agent, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as such Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon either Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

(c) Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt. SECTION 10.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by either Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by either Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by 70
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan, the acceptance of a B/A or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether either Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company, and the Required Lenders or by the Company, and the U.S. Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or the amount of any LC Exposure or any amount payable in respect of B/As or reduce the rate of interest thereon, reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or B/A or the amount of any LC Exposure, or any interest thereon, or any fees or other amount payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(c) or (d) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of either Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. SECTION 10.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

(b) The Company shall indemnify each Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan, B/A or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, or willful misconduct or unlawful acts of such Indemnitee. (c) WITHOUT LIMITING ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH INDEMNIFIED PERSON SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED AND HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE ORDINARY SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNIFIED PERSON. WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE SURVIVAL OF ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER BORROWER HEREUNDER, THE OBLIGATIONS OF EACH BORROWER UNDER THIS SECTION 10.03 SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PAYMENT OR ASSIGNMENT OF THE LOANS. (d) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to either Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (e) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither Borrower shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan, B/A or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 72
(f) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days after written demand therefor. SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) neither Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by either Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of: (A) the Company, provided, that no consent of the Company shall be required for an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, for an assignment to any other assignee; and (B) the U.S. Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the U.S. Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment. (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the U.S. Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the U.S. Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing; (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement; 73
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the U.S. Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500; (D) in the case of any such assignment of a Canadian Commitment or Canadian Revolving Loan, the assignee shall be a Canadian Resident; and (E) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the U.S. Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. (iv) The U.S. Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent for each Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans, amounts in respect of B/As and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and each Borrower, each Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the U.S. Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this 74
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of either Borrower, either Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) or the postponement of any prepayment of a Canadian Borrowing made pursuant to Section 2.11(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. SECTION 10.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by either Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, acceptance of any B/A and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that either Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had 75
notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and B/A, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. SECTION 10.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the U.S. Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the U.S. Administrative Agent and when the U.S. Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. SECTION 10.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 10.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of either Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. SECTION 10.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed, and the rights of the Parties determined, in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. 76
(b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from either thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that either Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against either Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. SECTION 10.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 10.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other 77
advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to either Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to either Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Company relating to the Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or is furnished or deemed furnished pursuant to Section 5.01(a)(i), (b)(i), (e) or (f); provided that, in the case of information received from the Company after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. SECTION 10.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. SECTION 10.14. Conversion of Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including the Canadian Borrower) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given. 78
(b) The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "Applicable Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss, and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Applicable Creditor shall refund the amount of such excess to the applicable Borrower. The obligations of the parties contained in this Section 10.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder. SECTION 10.15. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the USA Patriot Act. SECTION 10.16. Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in this Agreement shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that such action or condition would be permitted by an exception to, or otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists. SECTION 10.17. FINAL AGREEMENT. THIS WRITTEN AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES, IF ANY, CONSTITUTE A "LOAN AGREEMENT" AS DEFINED IN SECTION 26.02(a) OF THE TEXAS BUSINESS & COMMERCE CODE, REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF. SECTION 10.18. Waiver of Notice of Termination Under Existing Credit Agreement. Each Lender that is a "Lender" under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement hereby waives any requirement under the Existing Credit Agreement that notice be given prior to the prepayment of loans or termination of commitments thereunder; provided that such commitments are terminated by notice to the administrative agent under the Existing Credit Agreement on the Effective Date. 79
