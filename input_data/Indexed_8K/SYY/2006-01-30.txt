Palizza Assistant Treasurer (281) 584-1308 SYSCO REPORTS 8.7 PERCENT SALES GROWTH IN SECOND QUARTER AND DILUTED EPS OF $0.33 HOUSTON, JANUARY 30, 2006 -- SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY), North America's leading foodservice marketer and distributor, today announced sales and earnings results for the 13-week second quarter of fiscal year 2006 that ended December 31, 2005. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2006 HIGHLIGHTS: o Sales increased 8.7% to $7.971 billion from $7.331 billion in last year's second quarter. o Net earnings were $204.2 million vs. $232.6 million in last year's second quarter. o Diluted earnings per share were $0.33 compared to $0.36 in last year's second quarter. o Gross profit margins increased 21 basis points in the quarter compared to the same period last year, or 19.27% compared to 19.06%. o Second quarter EPS data includes a net expense of $0.04 for incremental share-based compensation, principally stock option expense, which was not required to be expensed in fiscal 2005. FIRST HALF FISCAL 2006 HIGHLIGHTS: o Sales increased 7.5% to $15.982 billion from $14.863 billion in the same period last year. o Net earnings after the cumulative effect of an accounting change taken during SYSCO's first fiscal quarter of 2006 were $412.7 million compared to $458.6 million in the first half of fiscal 2005. o Diluted earnings per share were $0.64 compared to $0.70 in last year's first 26 weeks. o Gross profit margins increased 11 basis points in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period last year, or 19.18% compared to 19.07%. o EPS data for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006 includes a net expense of $0.09 for incremental share-based compensation, principally stock option expense, which was not required to be expensed in fiscal 2005. Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman, chief executive officer and president, commented, "I am very pleased with this quarter's sales growth of 8.7 percent, which is a return to SYSCO's historical performance levels. The results were due to sound execution of our growth strategies, including Business Reviews, increased staffing in our key Customer Contact areas and the efforts of our marketing associates. Our strategic investments in these areas were validated by the growth they produced, and we will continue to invest in these areas for future growth. Our industry has endured a variety of challenges in the past several quarters, especially in terms of fuel costs and the effects of food cost inflation. By remaining focused on our long-term goals, we have executed on the basic building blocks of our business and positioned ourselves for future success." SALES: The quarter's 8.7 percent sales growth includes sales from non-comparable acquisitions (less than 12 months) of 1.3 percent. Second quarter sales growth also includes inflation, as measured by the change in SYSCO's cost of goods, of 0.6 percent. SYSCO's Business Review process continued to produce strong customer relationships during the quarter. The process, which tailors value-added products and services such as menu reengineering and customer loyalty programs, was performed with more than 8,500 customers during the second quarter, resulting in sales increases in the mid-teens percentage range during the quarter for those customers reviewed. The company has also increased its Customer Contact personnel by approximately 3.0 percent since the start of fiscal year 2006 - principally marketing associates and business review and development professionals - to continue to build on its sales success. GROSS PROFIT MARGINS: Gross profit margins increased 21 basis points in the second quarter, the largest increase in the last 14 consecutive quarters. Customer mix led the gross profit margin increase. Marketing associate-served sales - sales to SYSCO's core business of independent restaurants - were 53.3 percent of U.S. broadline sales in the quarter versus 53.1 percent last year. -more-
EXPENSES: Operating expenses as a percent to sales were 14.70 percent during the second quarter compared to 13.71 percent in the same quarter a year ago. Major items of expense incurred in the quarter that were in excess of last year's second quarter expenses include an additional $13.0 million in fuel expense; $5.9 million in added pension expense; and a smaller gain in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance in the amount of $3.5 million that resulted in a negative comparison of $10.8 million. Expense for share-based compensation - an item that is included in second quarter fiscal 2006 expenses but is not included in expenses for the same period last year-- totaled $29.3 million. In addition, costs for the National Supply Chain project, net of benefits, were $14.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. CAPITAL SPENDING: Capital expenditures during the quarter were $138.6 million. Through the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2006, capital expenditures were $232.8 million. For the entire fiscal year 2006, the company continues to project capital expenditures to be in a range of $425 million to $450 million, which is in line with SYSCO's historical capital spending trends. OTHER RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: Ramp-up of case volume at SYSCO's Northeast Redistribution Center (RDC) will resume in February. The ramp-up process will continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2006, with the majority of projected weekly case volume flowing through the facility by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter. Management continues to expect the National Supply Chain project to produce competitive advantages for SYSCO, including better procurement practices and warehousing techniques and overall supply chain efficiencies. In January of 2006 SYSCO completed the purchase of land in Alachua, Florida for the future site of its second Redistribution Center (RDC). Construction of that facility is expected to be completed within the next 14 to 16 months. Construction of SYSCO's fold-out operation that will serve the Raleigh, North Carolina market progressed according to plan during the quarter and that facility is expected to begin distributing product by the end of fiscal 2006. Sysco Food Services - Gulf Coast, Inc., the company's broadline fold-out in Geneva, Alabama, opened in December 2005. SYSCO's FreshPoint subsidiary completed the acquisition of A-One-A Produce & Dairy (Pompano Beach, FL; $90.8 million in sales for calendar year 2004) during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, broadliner Western Foods (Little Rock, AR; approximately $62.3 million in sales for its fiscal year 2005) merged into SYSCO's Little Rock operation during the quarter. Approximately $177.8 million was invested to repurchase 5.6 million shares during the second quarter. SYSCO has approximately 21.5 million shares remaining on its current share repurchase authorizations. CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST: As previously announced, SYSCO's second quarter fiscal 2006 earnings conference call will be held at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Monday, January 30, 2006. A live webcast of the call, as well as a copy of this press release, will be available online at www.sysco.com under Investor Relations.

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements regarding future capital expenditures; the potential for future success; and the expected timing and benefits of the national supply chain project and regional redistribution centers. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management's current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially. Those risks and uncertainties that could impact these statements include risks that pertain to SYSCO's business, including the risks relating to the foodservice distribution industry's relatively low profit margins and sensitivity to general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and consumer spending; increased fuel costs; SYSCO's leverage and debt risks; the successful completion of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies; the risk of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, work stoppages or otherwise; construction schedules; management's allocation of capital and the timing of capital purchases such as fleet and equipment; competitive conditions; labor issues; and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. Earnings are also impacted by option expensing, which is based on certain assumptions regarding the number and fair value of options granted, resulting tax benefits and shares outstanding. Capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and others factors. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2005 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. - more -
