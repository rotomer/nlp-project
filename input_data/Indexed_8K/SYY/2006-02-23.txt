ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. Amendment of SERP On February 17, 2006, upon the approval of the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of SYSCO Corporation (the "Company"), the Board ratified the First Amendment (the "Amendment") to the Sixth Amended and Restated SYSCO Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). The Amendment, which is effective as of July 2, 2006, modifies the SERP's definition of "final average compensation," which is one of the variables used to determine the amount of a participant's SERP benefit (which benefit is generally paid monthly in an annuity form). Prior to the Amendment, the SERP defined final average compensation generally as a participant's average monthly "eligible earnings" (as defined in the SERP) for the 5 consecutive years out of the 10 years prior to the earliest to occur of certain specified events (i.e., death, disability, retirement, certain change of control situations, and the "freezing" of a participant's participation in the SERP as a result of the participant being no longer eligible to participate in the Company's Management Incentive Plan) that yielded the highest average monthly eligible earnings. The Amendment removes the requirement that the 5 years used to determine final average compensation be consecutive [i.e., final average compensation is now defined as a participant's average monthly eligible earnings for the 5 years (not necessarily consecutive) out of the 10 years prior to the earliest to occur of the specified events described above that yield the highest average monthly eligible earnings]. 2
