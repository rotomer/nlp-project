ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT DIRECTOR COMPENSATION The response to Item 5.02 below is incorporated herein by reference. On February 28, 2006, after consideration of the conclusions and recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors (a) acted in accordance with its authority under the Company's Non-Employee Directors Stock Plans (the "Plans") to treat Mr. Campbell's tentatively planned resignation from the Board of Directors as though Mr. Campbell was retiring from the Board of Directors on or after he reached the age of 71 so that Mr. Campbell's Options and Restricted Stock (as such terms are defined under the Plans) shall not be forfeited and shall remain in effect, vest, become exercisable and expire as if Mr. Campbell had remained a non-employee director of the Company and had not ceased to provide services to the Board solely for purposes of maintaining the benefits of the Options and Restricted Stock, and (b) authorized the Company to make a cash payment to Mr. Campbell in an amount sufficient to reimburse Mr. Campbell for the sum of the amount of additional tax, if any, which may be owed by Mr. Campbell under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of the foregoing actions, plus any income tax payable by Mr. Campbell as a result of such payments to Mr. Campbell. ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS RESIGNATION OF DIRECTOR On March 1, 2006, Mr. Colin Campbell tendered his resignation from the Board of Directors of SYSCO Corporation (the "Company"), effective immediately. Mr. Campbell is the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation ("CWF") and The Colonial Williamsburg Company ("CWC"). CWC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CWF. The Company is expected to enter into a contract to supply food and related items to CWC on March 3, 2006. Management believes that it is reasonably likely that sales to CWC will exceed 2% of CWC's consolidated gross annual revenues. As a result of the duality of interests, Mr. Campbell has informed the Board that he believes it would no longer be appropriate for him to be considered an independent director and he has therefore determined that he will leave the Board at this time. There was no disagreement between Mr. Campbell and the Board over any matter. In connection with Mr. Campbell's resignation, the Board of Directors reduced the size of the Board of Directors to eleven members. A copy of the press release dated March 1, 2006 related to Mr. Campbell's departure is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. Mr. Campbell has no other material relationships with the Company other than as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC on September 30, 2005. ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. CHANGES IN COMMITTEE COMPOSITION Following Mr. Campbell's resignation, directors Cassaday, Craven, Hafner, Merrill, Newcomb, Sewell, Tilghman and Ward will continue to be designated as independent. Mr. Tilghman is the non-executive Vice Chairman of CWF and CWC. He has no other relationships with the Company or its management or with the management of CWF or CWC. Neither CWC nor the Company is dependent on the
contract. After considering the foregoing and all other relevant factors, the independent members of the Board, upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, have determined that Mr. Tilghman does not have a material relationship with the Company or its management. As a result of the foregoing, the composition of the standing Board committees has been revised, effective as of March 1, 2006. Following the changes, the Company's standing committees include the following: COMPENSATION AND STOCK OPTION COMMITTEE. Mr. Cassaday, Chairman; Messrs. Merrill and Tilghman, and Ms. Ward. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE. Ms. Ward, Chairman; Mr. Cassaday, Dr. Craven and Ms. Sewell. AUDIT COMMITTEE. Mr. Tilghman, Chairman; Messrs. Hafner and Merrill, Ms. Newcomb and Ms. Sewell. FINANCE COMMITTEE. Mr. Hafner, Chairman; Messrs. Golden and Schnieders, and Dr. Craven and Ms. Newcomb.

He received an option grant in fiscal 2005 having a Black Scholes value of $12,425.
