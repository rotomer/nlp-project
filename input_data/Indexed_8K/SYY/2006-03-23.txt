Item 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. On March 6, 2006, Sysco Corporation ("SYSCO") entered into a stock repurchase plan with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC under which Wells Fargo will repurchase on behalf of SYSCO up to 1.5 million shares of SYSCO common stock pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The shares will be purchased pursuant to SYSCO's previously announced share repurchase programs. Subject to certain conditions, the shares will be purchased during the period between March 6, 2006 and May 2, 2006, including during company "blackout" periods. Depending upon prevailing market conditions and other factors, there can be no assurance that any or all authorized shares will be purchased pursuant to the plan. Rule 10b5-1 provides certain defenses to actions under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder for transactions conducted pursuant to written trading plans that satisfy the conditions of the Rule. SYSCO's Policy on Trading in Company Securities, which prohibits purchases by SYSCO of its securities during certain "blackout" periods, contains an exception for stock trading plans entered into pursuant to Rule 10b5-1. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, SYSCO Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. SYSCO CORPORATION Date: March 23, 2006 By: /s/ Michael C. Nichols ------------------------------------- Michael C. Nichols Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary 2
