NEWS RELEASE
SYSCO Corporation 1390 Enclave Parkway Houston, Texas 77077-2099 (281) 584-1390
SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY) today announced sales and earnings results for the 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended July 1, 2006.
HOUSTON, August 14, 2006 
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
Fiscal Year 2006 Highlights:
     Richard J. Schnieders, SYSCO's chairman, chief executive officer and president, commented, "The success of our growth initiatives, including our business reviews and the addition of customer contact professionals, enabled SYSCO to complete the fourth fiscal quarter with the same strong sales momentum that characterized the prior three quarters of fiscal 2006. I am especially pleased with the results in light of the many higher expenses we encountered during the year. I extend my sincere appreciation to all of our associates and operating companies for their tremendous efforts. Entering the first quarter of fiscal 2007, many of the higher expenses we encountered in fiscal 2006 will become more comparable, and I am optimistic about our sales, earnings and market share growth opportunities in the new fiscal year."
Overview of EITF 04-13:
     SYSCO adopted accounting pronouncement EITF 04-13 , at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The accounting standard requires certain transactions  where inventory is purchased by SYSCO from a customer and then resold at a later date to the same customer  to be presented in the income statement on a net basis. The impact of adopting this new standard resulted in sales being reduced by $99.8 million. Cost of sales was also reduced by the same amount and thus net earnings are unaffected by the adoption of this standard. SYSCO applied this accounting pronouncement beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and will apply it to similar transactions prospectively. Prior year's sales and cost of sales have not been restated. Therefore, the calculation of sales growth and the comparison of gross margins, operating expenses and earnings as a percent to sales between the two years are affected.
(Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty)
Sales:
     Net sales growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was 6.6%. The impact of adopting EITF 04-13 reduced fourth quarter 2006 sales growth by 1.3 percent, or $99.8 million. Sales from non-comparable acquisitions (less than 12 months) contributed 1.5 percent to the fourth quarter's sales growth. Food cost deflation, as measured by the change in SYSCO's cost of goods, was 0.17 percent.
 
     During the fourth quarter more than 9,000 business reviews were performed at SYSCO's U.S. broadline operations. Sales to customers that participated in the review process continued to increase, on average, in the mid-teens range. An additional 1.2 percent, or 125, customer contact professionals were also added during the quarter.
     Sales for fiscal year 2006 increased 7.8 percent, including 1.4 percent from non-comparable acquisitions (less than 12 months) and food cost inflation of 0.59 percent as measured by the change in SYSCO's cost of goods. The fourth quarter fiscal 2006 adoption of EITF 04-13 also reduced fiscal year sales growth by 0.3 percent, or $99.8 million.
     Approximately 39,000 business reviews were performed during fiscal 2006 with the company's independent restaurant customers. Sales to customers that participated in the business review process increased, on average, in the mid-teens range. SYSCO also added 619 customer contact professionals during the fiscal year, a 6.2 percent increase over last year's staffing level.
Gross Profit Margins:
     Gross profit margins increased 52 basis points in the fourth quarter to 19.86 percent compared to 19.34 percent in last year's fourth quarter, including a 23 basis point benefit from adopting EITF 04-13. This gross profit expansion was primarily the result of deflation, efficient merchandising and customer and category mix. For the fiscal year, gross profit margins increased 18 basis points, to 19.28 percent compared to last year's 19.10 percent. The adoption of EITF 04-13 contributed 6 basis points to the fiscal year increase in gross margins.
Expenses:
     Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 14.75 percent during the fourth quarter compared to 13.55 percent in the same quarter last year. Adopting EITF 04-13 increased fourth quarter 2006 expenses as a percent of sales by 17 basis points due to the reduction of $99.8 million in reported sales. Certain expense items in the fourth quarter that were in excess of last year's fourth quarter expenses included fuel costs and pension expense, which increased $10.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Incremental share-based compensation expense of $27.1 million was also included in this year's fourth quarter, but was neither required nor included in the results from last year's fourth quarter.
     For fiscal year 2006 operating expenses as a percent of sales were 14.70 percent compared to 13.85 percent last year. Adopting EITF 04-13 for the fourth quarter increased fiscal year 2006 expenses as a percent of sales by 4 basis points due to the reduction of $99.8 million in reported sales. Certain expense items incurred during fiscal year 2006 that were in excess of last year's expenses included fuel costs and pension expense, which increased $48.6 million and $23.7 million, respectively. Incremental share-based compensation expense of $118.0 million was also included in this fiscal year's expense items but was neither required nor included in last year's results.
     SYSCO's long-standing executive compensation philosophy directly links potential annual bonus payments for senior management and key executives to the company's results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, expenses related to management performance-based incentive compensation were approximately $16 million below last year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, expenses related to management performance-based incentive compensation were approximately $27 million below last year.
Capital Spending:
     Capital expenditures during the quarter were $150.3 million. For the fiscal year, capital expenditures totaled $514.8 million. The company projects capital expenditures will be in a range of $575 million to $625 million for fiscal 2007 primarily for growth investments in facility replacements and expansions, construction of fold-out operations, additions to fleet and continued investment in the National Supply Chain project.
Other Recent Developments:

Preparations for the Knoxville, Tennessee broadline fold-out that was announced in March 2006 continue to progress according to plan.

Forward-Looking Statements
     
Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements regarding atypical costs becoming more comparable; future capital expenditures; the potential for future success; expense trends; the ability to achieve growth in sales, market share and earnings; and the expected timing and benefits of the national supply chain project and regional redistribution centers. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on management's current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially. Those risks and uncertainties that could impact these statements include risks that pertain to SYSCO's business, including the risks relating to the foodservice distribution industry's relatively low profit margins and sensitivity to general economic conditions, including the current economic environment and consumer spending; increased fuel costs; SYSCO's leverage and debt risks; the successful completion of acquisitions and integration of acquired companies; the risk of interruption of supplies due to lack of long-term contracts, severe weather, work stoppages or otherwise; construction schedules; management's allocation of capital and the timing of capital purchases such as fleet and equipment; competitive conditions; labor issues; and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses. Earnings are also impacted by option expensing, which is based on certain assumptions regarding the number and fair value of options granted, resulting tax benefits and shares outstanding. Capital expenditures may vary from those projected based on changes in business plans and others factors. For a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements, see the Company's Annual Report on
