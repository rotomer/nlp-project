ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On May 7, 2007, SYSCO Corporation ("SYSCO" or the "Company") issued a press release announcing its revised results of operations and financial condition for the third quarter ended March 31, 2007 of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. The financial information in this press release supersedes the financial information contained in SYSCO's press release dated April 30, 2007, as furnished with its Form 8-K of April 30, 2007. As described below at Item 4.02, the Company is restating its financial statements for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007 to correct the Company's accounting for corporate-owned life insurance policies. The financial information for the third quarter contained in the May 7, 2007 press release has likewise been revised to reflect the appropriate accounting treatment. SYSCO hereby incorporates by reference herein the information set forth in its press release dated May 7, 2007 (the "Press Release"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     Except for the historical information contained in this report, the statements made by SYSCO are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW
Non-Reliance on Financial Statements
     During a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors held on May 3, 2007, the Audit Committee and SYSCO's management concluded that the Company's unaudited interim financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2006 and December 30, 2006, as contained in SYSCO's Reports on Form 10-Q filed on November 9, 2006 and February 8, 2007, respectively, should no longer be relied upon due to an error in the Company's application of FASB Staff Position No. FTB 85-4-1, "Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third-Party Investors" (FSP FTB 85-4-1). As a result, the Company is restating its previously filed financial statements for those interim quarterly periods in fiscal 2007 to correct the accounting for the Company's corporate-owned life insurance policies. The restated financial statements will be included in amended quarterly reports of Form 10-Q for those two quarters, which the Company expects to file today.
 
     In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company adopted FSP FTB 85-4-1 using the investment method. The Company's adoption resulted in a cumulative-effect change to retained earnings of $39,735,000 to recognize the impact of adjusting the existing corporate-owned life insurance policies to historical cost, and the Company ceased to recognize changes in the cash surrender value of these policies. In May 2007, management determined, in connection with the Company's periodic review and evaluation of the Company's corporate-owned life insurance policies, that such policies are not life settlement contracts as defined by FSP FTB 85-4-1, and therefore this accounting standard is not applicable to the Company. The previously filed financial statements for the first and second quarter therefore may not be relied upon, and must be restated to reverse the effects of the erroneous application of FSP FTB 85-4-1.
     The impact of the incorrect application of FSP FTB 85-4-1 is two-fold. First, we incorrectly recorded a loss from the cumulative effect of the accounting change of $39,735,000. This will be corrected by increasing Other Assets and Retained Earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reversing the cumulative effect of accounting change in the Consolidated Results of Operations and the corresponding changes to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Cash Flows for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007. Second, by adopting the investment method provided for in FSP FTB 85-4-1, we did not record any gains (or losses) during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007 related to changes in the cash surrender value of these agreements. The gains related to the change in cash surrender value during fiscal 2007 that should have been recorded and will be reflected in our restated financial statements are as follows:
The impact on reported earnings per share before and after the cumulative effect of accounting change due to the incorrect application of FSP FTB 85-4-1 is as follows:
 
     Management and the Audit Committee have discussed this matter with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
     (d) Exhibits.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sysco Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
 
Exhibit 99.1
     - SYSCO Corporation (NYSE: SYY) announced today that it will amend its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters as well as the third quarter earnings news release, for fiscal 2007, in order to correct the accounting for its corporate-owned life insurance policies. The effect of the correction will increase previously reported earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change and net earnings for the 39 weeks of fiscal 2007 by $15.0 million and $54.7 million, or $0.02 and $0.08 per diluted share, respectively.
HOUSTON, May 7, 2007
     In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, SYSCO adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position No. FTB 85-4-1, (FSP FTB 85-4-1), which resulted in a charge to earnings of $39.7 million related to the cumulative effect of the accounting change. In accordance with FSP FTB 85-4-1, SYSCO also ceased to recognize adjustments for increases or decreases in the cash surrender values of these policies. It has since been determined that SYSCO's corporate owned-life insurance policies are not subject to the accounting treatment as defined by FSP FTB 85-4-1, and, therefore, SYSCO incorrectly applied the accounting standard.
Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third-Party Investors
     The effect of the amendments is two-fold: first, the $39.7 million charge in the first quarter is reversed, and, second, the company recognizes gains related to changes in the cash surrender value of these policies in the amounts of $1.4 million in the first quarter, $9.8 million in the second quarter and $3.8 million in the third quarter. The amendment has no impact on the Company's previously reported net income for financial statements for any period prior to fiscal 2007.
     This morning the Company filed its amended first and second quarter fiscal 2007 Form 10-Qs reflecting the adjustments. SYSCO's third quarter fiscal 2007 Form 10-Q is expected to be filed on or before its required filing date of May 10, 2007. Included with this press release are the amended financial statements from the third quarter earnings news release originally distributed on April 30, 2007.
