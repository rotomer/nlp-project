Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Highlights
First Half Fiscal 2010 Highlights
     "I am encouraged by our operating performance this quarter," said Bill DeLaney, Sysco's chief executive officer. "While the business environment remains challenging, deflation pressures appear to be moderating from highs we saw early in the quarter and case volume trends continue to improve. I want to recognize our associates for their efforts during the quarter, as they continued to provide excellent service to our customers, improve productivity and maintain strong cost controls."
 
Second Quarter Fiscal 2010 Summary
     Sales for the second quarter were $8.9 billion, a decrease of 3.1% compared to the same period last year. Food cost deflation, as measured by the estimated change in Sysco's cost of goods, was 3.5% percent for the quarter. Sales from acquisitions (within the last 12 months) increased sales by 0.6%. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates for the quarter increased sales by 1.2%.
     Operating expenses declined $96 million, or 7.2%, for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year period. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily a result of a $37 million favorable change in the value of Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) and a $25 million decline in payroll expense related to reduced headcount. Operating income increased $40 million, or 9.6%, to $462 million during the second quarter, and operating margin was 5.2%.
     Net earnings for the second quarter were $268 million, an increase of $31 million, or 12.9%. Diluted EPS was $0.45, aided by a $0.01 favorable impact from COLI, compared to $0.40 in the prior year period which included a $0.05 negative impact from COLI.

     Operating expenses declined $227 million, or 8.4%, for the first half of fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year period.

Operating income increased $33 million, or 3.6%, to $960 million during the first half of fiscal 2010, and operating margin was 5.3%.
     Net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2010 were $595 million, an increase of $80 million, or 15.6%. Diluted EPS was $1.00, aided by a $0.04 favorable impact from COLI and a $0.05 tax benefit related to the company's IRS settlement announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
