SECTION 5  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
ITEM 5.07 SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.
At the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Sysco Corporation ("Sysco" or the "Company") held on November 16, 2011, Sysco's stockholders re-elected each of the Company's directors that had been nominated to serve until the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The stockholders also approved, by non-binding vote, the compensation paid to Sysco's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion; recommended, by non-binding vote, that Sysco conduct a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year; approved an amendment to Sysco's Bylaws to implement a staggered declassification of the Board of Directors over a three-year period beginning with the election of the Class II directors for a one-year term at Sysco's 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; and ratified the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Sysco's independent accountants for fiscal 2012.
In light of the stockholder recommendation regarding the frequency of the stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, it is the current intention of the Sysco Board of Directors to conduct an annual stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation until the next required vote on the frequency of stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation.
The final results of the voting on each matter of business at the 2011 Annual Meeting are as follows:
Election of Directors
 
Approval, by non-binding vote, of the compensation paid to Sysco's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion
 
Recommendation, by non-binding vote, of the frequency with which Sysco will conduct stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation
 
 
Approval of an amendment to Sysco's Bylaws to implement a staggered declassification of the Board of Directors over a three-year period beginning with the election of the Class II directors for a one-year term at Sysco's 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
 
Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Sysco's independent accountants for fiscal 2012
 
Because the proposal to amend Sysco's Bylaws to implement a staggered declassification of the Board of Directors required the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote, abstentions and broker non-votes had the effect of a vote against the proposal. There were 589,903,128 total shares outstanding and entitled to vote with respect to the 2011 Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes were disregarded with respect to the election of directors and all other proposals.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sysco Corporation has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
