A meeting will be held at the Closing Location at 4:00 p.m., Houston time, on the New York Business Day next preceding the Time of Delivery, at which meeting the final drafts of the documents to be delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence will be available for review by the parties hereto.

5. The Company and the Guarantors agree with each of the Underwriters:
(a) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by the Representative and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement; to make no further amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus prior to the Time of Delivery which shall be disapproved by the Representative
 
promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representative, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus has been filed and to furnish the Representative with copies thereof; to prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of the Securities, in a form approved by the Representative and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act within the time required by such Rule; to file promptly all other material required to be filed by the Company or any of the Guarantors with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act; to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company or any of the Guarantors with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act subsequent to the date of the Prospectus and for so long as the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities; to advise the Representative, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus in respect of the Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act, of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus or other prospectus or suspending any such qualification, to promptly use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order; and in the event of any such issuance of a notice of objection, promptly to take such steps including, without limitation, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at its own expense, as may be necessary to permit offers and sales of the Securities by the Underwriters (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
(b) If required by Rule 430B(h) under the Act, to prepare a form of prospectus in a form approved by the Representative and to file such form of prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act not later than may be required by Rule 424(b) under the Act; and to make no further amendment or supplement to such form of prospectus which shall be disapproved by the Representative promptly after reasonable notice thereof;
(c) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantors will, upon reasonable written request from the Underwriters, promptly file, if they have not already done so and are eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative. If at the Renewal Deadline the Company and the Guarantors are no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company and the Guarantors will, upon reasonable written request from the Underwriters, promptly file, if they have not already done so, a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representative and will use their best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company and the Guarantors will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be;
 
(d) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representative may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, provided that in connection therewith none of the Company or the Guarantors shall be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;
(e) Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement and from time to time, to furnish the Underwriters with written and electronic copies of the Prospectus in New York City in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representative and upon its request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as the Representative may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) in connection with sales of any of the Securities at any time nine months or more after the time of issue of the Prospectus, upon the request of the Representative but at the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such Underwriter as many written and electronic copies as the Representative may request of an amended or supplemented Prospectus complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;
(f) To furnish to counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, a signed copy of the Registration Statement and six conformed copies (including exhibits thereto) and, for delivery to each other Underwriter, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto), in each case prior to the Time of Delivery under the Agreement;
(g) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than sixteen months after the effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) under the Act), an earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158);
 
(h) During the period beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the later of the Time of Delivery and such earlier time as the Representative may notify the Company, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose, except as provided hereunder of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any Guarantor which mature more than one year after the Time of Delivery and that are substantially similar to the Notes or the Guarantees, without the prior written consent of the Representative;
(i) To pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) under the Act without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) under the Act; and
(j) To use the net proceeds received by it from the sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement in the manner specified in the Pricing Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds."
6. (a) (i) The Company and the Guarantors represent and agree that, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the Representative, they have not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act;
(ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representative, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and
(iii) any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representative (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule III(a) hereto;
(b) The Company and the Guarantors have complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; and
(c) The Company and the Guarantors agree that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representative and, if requested by the Representative, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
 
7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's and the Guarantors' counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, any Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) any filing fees incident to, and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (vi) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the Company's and the Guarantors' respective obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in the discretion of the Representative, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company and the Guarantors shall have performed all of their respective obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
(a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company or the Guarantors pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to the Representative's reasonable satisfaction;
 
(b) Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representative such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and such other related matters as the Representative may reasonably request, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;
(c) Bracewell & Guiliani LLP, counsel for the Company and the Guarantors, shall have furnished to the Representative their written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery, in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex I; and Russell T.

(d) On the date of the Prospectus at a time prior to the execution of this Agreement, at 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the effective date of any post effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement and also at the Time of Delivery, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representative a letter or letters, dated the respective dates of delivery thereof, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representative, to the effect set forth in Annex III hereto;
(e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of the Representative so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
(f) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities;

(h) The Company shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5(e) hereof with respect to the furnishing of prospectuses on the New York Business Day next succeeding the date of this Agreement; and
(i) The Company and the Guarantors shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representative at the Time of Delivery certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantors satisfactory to the Representative as to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors herein at and as of such time, as to the performance by the Company and the Guarantors of all of their respective obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to such time, as to the matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section and as to such other matters as the Representative may reasonably request.
9. (a) The Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantors shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
 
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantors against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company and the Guarantors may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantors for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and the Guarantors in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any indemnification liability which it may have to the indemnified party except to the extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any other liability that it may have to such indemnified party. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. However, in the event that (i) any indemnified party reasonably determines in its judgment that having common counsel would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of the action or proceeding or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party in a timely manner or (iii) counsel to such indemnified party determines that one or more defenses may be available to such indemnified party that are not available to the indemnifying party or another indemnified party, then such indemnified party may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in any such action or proceeding and the indemnifying party will pay the reasonable and customary fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided, however, that the indemnifying party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) for such indemnified party in any jurisdiction in any single action or proceeding. In the absence of any of the foregoing, in any action or proceeding the defense of which the indemnifying party assumes, such indemnified party will have the right to participate in such
 
litigation and to retain its own counsel at such indemnified party's own expense. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantors may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and the Guarantors (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Guarantors within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representative may in its discretion arrange for itself or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representative does not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representative to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representative notifies the Company that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representative that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representative or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantors agree to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representative may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representative and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantors, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or any Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or any Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company and the Guarantors as provided herein, the Company and the Guarantors will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representative for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representative, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company and the Guarantors shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representative shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the Representative in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company or the Guarantors set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the Representative upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
 
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company and the Guarantors, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14.

18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.

Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth herein, and having due regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The foregoing opinion is, with your approval, predicated upon and qualified in its entirety by the following:
 
 
 
Because the primary purpose of our engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial or accounting matters and because of the wholly or partially non-legal character of many of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (except to the extent expressly set forth in paragraph 10 above), and we have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid). Without limiting the foregoing, we assume no responsibility for, have not independently verified and have not been asked to comment on the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data included in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and we have not examined the accounting, financial or other records from which such financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data were derived. We are not
 
experts with respect to any portion of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement or the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including, without limitation, such financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data therein. However, we have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, its independent registered public accounting firm, your representatives and your counsel at which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Based upon such participation and review, and relying as to materiality in part upon the factual statements of officers and other representatives of the Company and of your representatives, we advise you that no facts have come to our attention that have caused us to believe that (i) any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became effective (including the documents incorporated by reference therein, but excluding the financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data and the Form T-1, as to which we have not been asked to comment), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Registration Statement (including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, but excluding the financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data and the Form T-1, as to which we have not been asked to comment), at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein, but excluding the financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, or (iv) the Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, considered together (including the documents incorporated by reference therein, but excluding the financial statements, schedules and other financial or accounting data, as to which we have not been asked to comment), as of 2:38 p.m., Eastern time, on June 6, 2012, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
This opinion is solely for your benefit, in your capacity as Representative of the Underwriters, pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement, and may not be used or relied upon by you in any other capacity or for any other purpose and may not be used or relied upon for any purpose by any other person or entity without our express prior written authorization. Except for the use permitted herein, this opinion may not be quoted, circulated or published, in whole or in part, or otherwise referred to, filed with or furnished to any other person or entity, without our express prior written authorization. The opinion expressed herein is not an opinion with respect to matters of fact or a guarantee and should not be construed or relied upon as such. The opinion expressed herein is as of the date hereof, and we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our opinion after the date hereof. This opinion is strictly limited to the matters stated herein, and no other or more extensive opinion is intended, implied or to be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein.

Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
As Representative of the several underwriters
named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement
c/o Goldman, Sachs & Co
200 West Street
New York, NY 10282-2198
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 8(c) of that certain Underwriting Agreement, dated as of June 6, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among Sysco Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the Guarantors listed on Schedule I thereto (the "Guarantors" and, together with the Company, the "Opinion Parties") and you, as Representative of the several underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale by the Company to the Underwriters of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.55% Senior Notes due 2015 ( the "2015 Notes") and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.60% Senior Notes due 2022 (together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"), issued pursuant to the Indenture dated as of June 15, 1995, as supplemented and amended by the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as February 17, 2012, the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of June __, 2012 and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of June __, 2012, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to First Union National Bank, as Trustee (as so supplemented and amended, the "Indenture"). The Notes are guaranteed to the extent provided in the Indenture. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
I am Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company and Vice President of each of the Guarantors, and I am generally familiar with each Opinion Party's organizational history, properties, operations and Organizational Documents (as defined below). In connection with this opinion, I have considered, among other things:
(i) the certificate of incorporation or certificate of formation of each Opinion Party;
(ii) the operating agreement or bylaws of each Opinion Party (together with the documents in clause (i) above, the "Organizational Documents");
(iii) executed counterparts of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes;
(iv) the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus; and
(v) such other documents, transactions and matters of law as I deemed necessary in order to render this opinion.
My opinions expressed below are specifically subject to the following limitations, exceptions, qualifications and assumptions:
(a) In the examination of any and all documents, instruments, certificates and agreements, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those of the Opinion Parties), the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity to authentic, original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, conformed or photostatic copies. I have also assumed that each natural person executing any document, instrument, certificate or agreement that I have reviewed in connection with this opinion was legally competent to do so.
(b) As to various questions of fact relevant to the opinions expressed herein, I have relied upon, and assumed the accuracy of, certificates and other information of or from public officials and/or responsible officers of the Opinion Parties and the representations and warranties contained in the Underwriting Agreement.
(c) In basing the opinions and other matters set forth herein on "my knowledge," the words "my knowledge" signify that, in the course of my representation of the Opinion Parties, no information has come to my attention that would give me actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate or that any of the documents, certificates, reports, and information on which I have relied are not accurate and complete.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company and each Guarantor has been qualified as a foreign corporation or limited liability company for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction (other than its jurisdiction of formation) in which it owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in any such jurisdiction is not reasonably likely to, individually or the in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
2. Each Guarantor has the corporate or limited liability company, as applicable, power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business.
3. To my knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject which are reasonably likely to individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
 
4. To my knowledge, there are no contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any other person granting such person the right to require the Company to include the offering of any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person in the offering registered pursuant to the Registration Statement.
5. To my knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is (a) in violation of its Organizational Documents or similar organizational documents, as applicable, (b) in default, and to my knowledge no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the performance or observance of any obligation, agreement, term, covenant or condition contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, lease or other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound or (c) in violation of any law or statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, for any such defaults or violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the current or future consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
6. To my knowledge, no document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when such document was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such document was so filed, not misleading.
7. I do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus or the Prospectus which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
This opinion has been rendered solely for your benefit in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and may not be relied upon or otherwise referred to by any other person or for any other purpose without my prior written consent. I undertake no responsibility to update or supplement this opinion in any respect after the date hereof. The opinions expressed in this letter are limited to the matters set forth in this letter, and no other opinions should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
 
ANNEX III
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial information) examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representative of the Underwriters (the "Representative");
(iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Prospectus and/or included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which have been furnished to the Representative; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
(iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for such five fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
 
(v) They have compared the information in the Prospectus under selected captions with the disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K and on the basis of limited procedures specified in such letter nothing came to their attention as a result of the foregoing procedures that caused them to believe that this information does not conform in all material respects with the disclosure requirements of Items 301, 302, 402 and 503(d), respectively, of Regulation S-K;
(vi) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
(A)(i) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, or (ii) any material modifications should be made to the unaudited consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles;
(B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
 
(D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
(E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the Representative, or any increases in any items specified by the Representative, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(F) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or operating profit or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representative, or any increases in any items specified by the Representative, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representative, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(vii) In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (vi) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representative which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representative or in documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus specified by the Representative, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.

The acceptance of this Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement of the Holder hereof to all the terms and conditions of the Indenture. This Note is a Security of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000. To secure the due and punctual payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and any other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes when and as the same shall be due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, according to the terms of this Note and the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantors have unconditionally guaranteed the Obligations (as defined in the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture) on a senior basis pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Events of Default are defined in the Indenture and generally include: (i) default for 30 days in payment of any interest on the Securities; (ii) default in any payment of principal on any of the Securities when due and payable; (iii) failure on the part of the Issuer duly to observe or perform any of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Issuer in the Securities or in the Indenture which shall not have been remedied within 90 days after written
 
notice by the Trustee or by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby; or (iv) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each such affected series of then Outstanding Securities (voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal of all Securities of all such affected series, and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be immediately due and payable, except that, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer, the principal and interest on the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder. Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected (with all such series voting as a single class) at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by the Indenture, provided that the Trustee may decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee determines the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interest of Holders of the Securities of all series so affected not joining in the giving of said direction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their best interests. The Indenture requires the Issuer to furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holders for one or more of the following purposes (as more particularly set forth in the Indenture): (1) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property or assets to the Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series; (2) to evidence the succession of another entity to the Issuer; (3) to add to the covenants of the Issuer or add Events of Default for the benefit of Holders; (4) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision of the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision of the Indenture, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture as shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect; (5) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of the Indenture; and (6) to evidence the appointment of a successor Trustee.
The Indenture also permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding of each series to be affected (voting as a single class). The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as a single class), on behalf of the Holders of all such Securities, to waive certain past defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the
 
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
Without the consent of each Holder of each Note so effected, the Issuer may not extend the final maturity of any Note, or reduce the rate (or alter the method of computation) of interest thereon or extend the time for payment thereof, or reduce (or alter the method of computation of) any amount payable on redemption or repayment thereof or extend the time for payment thereof, or make the principal thereof or interest thereon (including any amount in respect of original issue discount) payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the Notes or in accordance with the terms thereof, or reduce the amount that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity of any Note, or impair or affect the right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof.

As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (1) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as trustee, (3) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes a direction inconsistent with such request and (4) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note, as described on the face hereof, at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes and of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Notes for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of the Notes, or (b) the Notes selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
In addition, the Issuer may maintain a drop agent, in such location or locations as the Issuer may select, to provide the Holders with an office at which they may present the Notes for registration of transfer or exchange. Notes accepted as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to be presented to the Security registrar on the Business Day next succeeding the day that Notes are delivered to the drop agent.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Subject to the terms of the Indenture, prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note or of certain restrictive covenants and Events of Default with respect to this Note, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture with respect to the Notes shall be discharged and canceled upon the payment of all of the Notes and shall be discharged except for certain obligations upon the irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of any combination of funds and U.S. Government Obligations sufficient for such payment.
In the case of any conflict between the provisions of this Note and the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall control.

The acceptance of this Note shall be deemed to constitute the consent and agreement of the Holder hereof to all the terms and conditions of the Indenture. This Note is a Security of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000. To secure the due and punctual payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and any other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes when and as the same shall be due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, according to the terms of this Note and the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantors have unconditionally guaranteed the Obligations (as defined in the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture) on a senior basis pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

notice by the Trustee or by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series affected thereby; or (iv) certain events involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each such affected series of then Outstanding Securities (voting as a single class) may declare the entire principal of all Securities of all such affected series, and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be immediately due and payable, except that, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer, the principal and interest on the Securities shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder. Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected (with all such series voting as a single class) at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by the Indenture, provided that the Trustee may decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee determines the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interest of Holders of the Securities of all series so affected not joining in the giving of said direction. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing default (except a default in payment of principal or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their best interests. The Indenture requires the Issuer to furnish an annual compliance certificate to the Trustee.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture without the consent of the Holders for one or more of the following purposes (as more particularly set forth in the Indenture): (1) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge any property or assets to the Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series; (2) to evidence the succession of another entity to the Issuer; (3) to add to the covenants of the Issuer or add Events of Default for the benefit of Holders; (4) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision of the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision of the Indenture, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture as shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders in any material respect; (5) to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of the Indenture; and (6) to evidence the appointment of a successor Trustee.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series at the time Outstanding with respect to which a default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (voting as a single class), on behalf of the Holders of all such Securities, to waive certain past defaults and Events of Default under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the
 
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
Without the consent of each Holder of each Note so effected, the Issuer may not extend the final maturity of any Note, or reduce the rate (or alter the method of computation) of interest thereon or extend the time for payment thereof, or reduce (or alter the method of computation of) any amount payable on redemption or repayment thereof or extend the time for payment thereof, or make the principal thereof or interest thereon (including any amount in respect of original issue discount) payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the Notes or in accordance with the terms thereof, or reduce the amount that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity of any Note, or impair or affect the right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof.

The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Notes for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of the Notes, or (b) the Notes selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Note to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.

Exhibit 5.1
Sysco Corporation
1390 Enclave Parkway
Houston, Texas 77077
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel for Sysco Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance by the Company of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0.55% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.60% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"), in each case guaranteed by the Guarantors (as defined below), pursuant to (a) the Registration Statement of the Company and the Guarantors on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-179582) (the "Registration Statement"), which was filed by the Company and the Guarantors with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and (b) the related prospectus dated February 17, 2012, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement relating to the sale of the Notes dated June 6, 2012 (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus"), as filed by the Company and the Guarantors with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act. At your request, this opinion is being furnished to you for filing as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report of the Company on Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission on the date hereof (the "Form 8-K").
The Notes and the related Guarantees are to be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 15, 1995 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented and amended by the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of February 17, 2012 (the "Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture"), the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of June 12, 2012 (the "Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture") and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture thereto dated as of June 12, 2012 (the "Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as successor to First Union National Bank, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture, the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, is referred to herein as the "Indenture." The Notes are guaranteed to the extent provided in the Indenture (the "Guarantees") by the Guarantors.
 
We have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified, of (i) the certificates of incorporation or certificates of formation of the Company and the Guarantors, as applicable, and the bylaws or limited liability company agreements of the Company and each of the Guarantors, as applicable; (ii) the Underwriting Agreement dated June 6, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement") by and among the Company, the Guarantors named in Schedule I thereto (the "Guarantors") and Goldman, Sachs & Co. as representative of the several Underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (the "Underwriters"), relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees; (iii) the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; (iv) the Base Indenture; (v) the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture; (vi) the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture; (vii) the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture; (viii) certain resolutions of the board of directors, managing members or sole members of the Company and each of the Guarantors, as applicable; and (ix) certificates of public officials and of representatives of the Company and the Guarantors. We also have made such investigations of law and examined originals or copies of such other documents and records as we have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In giving such opinions, we have relied upon certificates and representations of officers of each of the Company and the Guarantors, of governmental and public officials and of other sources believed by us to be responsible with respect to the accuracy of the material factual matters contained therein or covered thereby. We have assumed that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic and all documents submitted as certified or photostatic copies conform to the originals thereof.
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set forth herein, we are of the opinion that when the Notes have been duly executed, issued and delivered by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and duly purchased and paid for by the Underwriters in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes and the related Guarantees will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantors, respectively, enforceable against the Company and each of the Guarantors, respectively, in accordance with their terms, except as such enforcement is subject to (i) bankruptcy, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) including, without limitation, (a) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (b) concepts of good faith, reasonableness, fair dealing and materiality.
In giving the foregoing opinion, we have assumed the due authorization of the Guarantees and the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Thirteenth Supplemental Indenture, the Fourteenth Supplemental Indenture and the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture by each of the
 
Guarantors incorporated or formed pursuant to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. We express no opinions concerning (a) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law, or (b) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
The foregoing opinion is limited to the relevant contract law of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the relevant federal law of the United States of America. We express no opinion with respect to the federal or state securities laws or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, including the anti-fraud provisions of any such laws, or with respect to the law of any other jurisdiction. The opinion expressed herein is given as of the date hereof, and we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to advise you of any change in any matter set forth herein.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as an exhibit to the Form 8-K and to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
Very truly yours,
