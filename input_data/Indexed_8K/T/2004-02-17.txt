ARTICLE IV Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of Certificates 4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company: (a) Merger Consideration. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock (i) owned by Cingular or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Cingular (collectively, the "Cingular Companies"), (ii) owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, except, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such shares held on behalf of third parties, or (iii) shares of Common Stock (the "Dissenting Common Shares") that are owned by stockholders (the "Dissenting Common Stockholders") properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each, an "Excluded Common Share" and collectively, "Excluded Common Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive $15.00 in cash (the "Common Stock Merger Consideration"). If the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to December 16, 2004, the Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be increased by an amount of simple interest at a rate of 4% per annum based on a year of 365 days from and after December 16, 2004 to the day preceding the Effective Time, and the Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be an amount equal to $15.00 as increased pursuant to this sentence.At the Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shares of Common Stock shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Common Stock Certificate") formerly representing any such shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Common Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to the Common Stock Merger Consideration and any Dissenting Common Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 4.3. (b) Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Series C preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series C Preferred Stock") and each share of Series E preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Series E Preferred Stock" and together with the Series C Preferred Stock, the "Preferred Stock"; and the Preferred Stock together with the Common Stock, the "Shares"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than - 3 -
shares of Preferred Stock (the "Dissenting Preferred Shares" and together with Dissenting Common Shares, "Dissenting Shares") that are held by stockholders (the "Dissenting Preferred Stockholders" and together with the Dissenting Common Stockholders, the "Dissenting Stockholders") properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (together with the Excluded Common Shares, the "Excluded Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Company's certificate of incorporation) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for such share of Series C Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock, as applicable (the "Preferred Stock Merger Consideration", together with the Common Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all shares of Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shares of Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "Preferred Stock Certificate" and together with the Common Stock Certificates, the "Certificates") formerly representing any such shares of Preferred Stock (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and any Dissenting Preferred Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 4.3. (c) Cancellation of Shares. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Cingular Companies or owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company (in each case, other than such Shares that are held on behalf of third parties) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. (d) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 4.2. Exchange of Certificates for Shares. (a) Paying Agent. As of the Effective Time, Cingular shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent appointed by Cingular and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares), deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). (b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than five business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving - 4 -
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be. Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) multiplied by (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration or Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable. (c) Transfers. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Cingular for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article IV. (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) the Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, upon due surrender of their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Cingular, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or nature. - 5 -
(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Cingular as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the applicable Merger Consideration upon due surrender of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate being surrendered. Any affidavit of loss presented pursuant to this Article IV, to be deemed effective, must be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation. 4.3. Dissenters' Rights. Any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Cingular (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Cingular, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 4.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Common Stock Merger Consideration or the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 4.5. Treatment of Company Options/Other Equity Awards. (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option then outstanding shall become fully vested and shall be converted into the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof, an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration multiplied by each share of Common Stock subject to the portion of the Company Option so exercised. Each outstanding Company Option so converted shall, immediately following such conversion, be cancelled and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as practicable thereafter, an amount of cash (without interest) - 6 -
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the Common Stock Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock under such Company Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent) less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit (including outstanding restricted stock units resulting from the conversion of performance shares and deferred stock units) shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as practicable thereafter, an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration, subject to any deferral election in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time made by such holder under the Company's deferred compensation plans, less applicable Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. (c) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the date on which awards granted under the Company's performance share program are converted into restricted stock units, such awards shall, subject to Section 6.1(a)(xvii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, be paid to the holders thereof promptly following the Effective Time based upon the satisfaction of the performance goals applicable thereto immediately prior to the Effective Time (as determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time), and, if less than a full year, annualized for the full year. (d) The compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall make such adjustments and amendments to or make such determinations with respect to the Company Options, restricted stock units and performance share awards to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.5. 4.6. Treatment of DoCoMo Warrant. At the Effective Time, the warrant to purchase Common Stock issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2000 (the "DoCoMo Warrant Agreement"), by and among the Company, NTT DoCoMo, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Japan ("DoCoMo") and AT&T Corp., a New York corporation ("Former Parent") shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive upon exercise thereof and payment of the exercise price in respect thereof, an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares of Common Stock as to which the warrant would be exercisable for at the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Common Stock Merger Consideration. Cingular agrees to honor, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, the obligations of the Company and/or any other party (other than the holder of the Warrant) pursuant to Section 4.3 of the DoCoMo Warrant Agreement. - 7 -

Except as set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure letter delivered by SBC to the Company at the time of entering into this Agreement (the "SBC Disclosure Letter"), neither SBC nor BellSouth shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, prior to the Termination Date, (i) enter into any definitive agreement for the acquisition of any business or Person which provides commercial mobile wireless voice and data services offered to the public utilizing frequencies and spectrum licensed by the FCC, other than the provision of such services in de minimis amounts or (ii) take any action which would, at the time the action is taken, reasonably be expected to materially interfere with its ability to make available to Cingular or the Paying Agent as of the Effective Time funds -37-
sufficient for its Specified Interest of the Merger Consideration. Each of SBC and BellSouth will, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, make available to Cingular or the Paying Agent its Specified Interest of the Merger Consideration. 6.2. Acquisition Proposals. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant ("Representatives") retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to (a) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (b) any purchase of an equity interest representing an amount equal to or greater than a 15% voting or economic interest in the Company or (c) any purchase of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an amount equal to or greater than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition Proposal"). The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' employees, agents and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections 14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Directors' Recommendation in a manner adverse to Cingular or the approval of this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the Company, Cingular shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the extent set forth in Section 8.4(a) of this Agreement; and (ii) at any time prior to, but not after, the time this Agreement is adopted by the Company Requisite Vote, (A) providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement (other than standstill provisions) on customary terms; (B) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (other than standstill provisions) on customary terms; or (C) recommending such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in each case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and -38-
outside counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of obtaining financing, and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement taking into account any change in proposal proposed by Cingular; or (z) in the case of clause (C), Cingular shall have had written notice of the Company's intention to take the action referred to in clause (C) at least three business days prior to the taking of such action by the Company; provided, that any more favorable Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (B) or (C) above must involve 50% rather than the 15% used in the definition of Acquisition Proposal (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal is referred to in this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 6.2 of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. The Company agrees that it will notify Cingular promptly, but in any event within 48 hours if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Cingular informed on a current basis, and, in any event, within 48 hours of any changes in the status and terms of any such proposals or offers, including whether any such proposal has been withdrawn or rejected. The Company also agrees to provide any information to Cingular that it is providing to another Person pursuant to this Section 6.2 at substantially the same time it provides it to such other Person and that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a transaction with the Company to return all confidential information furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees promptly, but in any event, within five days after the date of this Agreement, to request the return or destruction of all information and materials provided prior to the date of this Agreement by it, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives with respect to the consideration or making of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.2 to the contrary, any actions taken by DoCoMo that are not in cooperation with the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives (except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement) shall not constitute a breach of this Section 6.2. 6.3. Information Supplied. The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that (i) the proxy statement of the Company (the "Proxy Statement") and any amendment or supplement thereto will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will at the date of mailing to -39-
stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading. 6.4. Stockholders Meeting. The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the "Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company shall make the Directors' Recommendation, the Directors' Recommendation shall be included in the Proxy Statement and the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Shares. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company determines after consultation with outside counsel that its fiduciary duties under applicable Law require it to withdraw, modify or qualify the Directors' Recommendation in a manner adverse to Cingular, the Board of Directors of the Company may so withdraw, modify or qualify the Directors' Recommendation, however, unless this Agreement is theretofore terminated, the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the holders of the Shares for adoption at the Stockholders Meeting. 6.5. Filings; Other Actions; Notification. (a) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement with the SEC and shall promptly notify Cingular of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall promptly provide to Cingular copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Cingular shall each use its best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. (b) The Company, Cingular and Cingular Wireless shall cooperate with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their respective best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings (including by filing no later than 30 days after the date of this Agreement all applications required to be filed with the FCC and the notification and required form under the HSR Act; provided, however, that the failure to -40-
file within 30 days will not constitute a breach of this Agreement) and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. BellSouth and SBC agree to use, to cause their Subsidiaries to use and to cause Cingular, Cingular Wireless and their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as Governmental Entities may require with respect to their respective businesses in order to assist Cingular, Cingular Wireless and their respective Subsidiaries in obtaining all necessary Governmental Consents. Nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Cingular, Cingular Wireless, BellSouth, SBC or their respective Subsidiaries to take any action or enter into any agreement with respect to any of its assets, business or operations (the sum of the aggregate positive and negative economic effects of all such actions and agreements on the value of the assets, business or operations of the combined Cingular, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries (excluding synergies anticipated to be realized by SBC, BellSouth, Cingular or their respective Subsidiaries from the Merger) and on the value of the assets, business or operations of BellSouth, SBC or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date of any determination being referred to herein as the "Net Effects"), that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in the aggregate negative Net Effects being more than the Material Adverse Amount (as defined in Section 6.5(b) of the Cingular Disclosure Letter (a "Material Adverse Condition")). For purposes of calculating Net Effects with respect to the sale of a market or spectrum it is agreed that (i) the Net Effects of the sale of a market owned by any of the Company, Cingular or Cingular Wireless will be an amount equal to the Per Subscriber Amount (as defined in Section 6.5 of the Cingular Disclosure Letter) multiplied by the number of subscribers in the system and operations in such market proposed by Cingular, in good faith, to be sold, and (ii) the Net Effects of the sale of spectrum-only shall be $0.50 per MHz POP. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, Cingular and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information relating to Cingular or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and Cingular shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. None of the Company, Cingular, Cingular Wireless, BellSouth or SBC shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the Merger unless it consults with the other parties reasonably in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate. (c) The Company and Cingular each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in -41-
connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Cingular, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (d) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Cingular each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by Cingular or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company shall give prompt notice to Cingular of any change, fact or condition, that is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Cingular's obligations to effect the Merger, and Cingular shall give prompt notice to the Company of any change, fact or condition, that is reasonably likely to result in a failure of any condition to the Company's obligations to effect the Merger. (e) Cingular's obligations under this Section 6.5 shall include, without limitation, the obligation to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, except to the extent it would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Condition, seeking to have any stay or other injunctive relief which would prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement entered by any court or other Governmental Entity reversed on appeal or vacated consistent with its other obligations under this Section 6.5. 6.6. Access. (a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Cingular's, its stockholders and its other Affiliates' officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Cingular all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company, and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure. At the request of Cingular, throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers from Persons who are -42-
parties to Contracts with the Company or its Subsidiaries that contain confidentiality provisions in order for Cingular to be provided reasonable access to such Contracts. (b) The Company shall make available to Cingular and its Representatives for inspection the consolidated U.S. Federal Income Tax Returns required to be prepared by the Company from and after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall make such Tax Returns available to Cingular at least 21 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns. 6.7. Consent/Tender Offers. With respect to the indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries specified in Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Specified Indebtedness"), at the request of Cingular, the Company shall, with respect to the Specified Indebtedness issued by it, and cause it Subsidiaries to, with respect to the Specified Indebtedness issued by such Subsidiary, use its reasonable best efforts to commence consent solicitations or issuer tender offers with respect to the Specified Indebtedness as and at the times that Cingular shall request ("Consent/Tender Offers"), in each case with the cooperation of Cingular. All Consent/Tender Offers shall be in accordance with applicable Law and shall be solely on the terms and conditions specified by Cingular; provided, that all Consent/Tender Offers (and all obligations to make any payments to holders of all or any portion of Specified Indebtedness in connection therewith or to modify the terms or provisions of any Specified Indebtedness) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger, and shall terminate immediately upon the termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. The Company agrees not to consummate any Consent/Tender Offer unless Cingular consents in writing to such consummation. The Company agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with Cingular and, subject to the preceding sentence and applicable Law, to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate all Consent/Tender Offers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be a condition to any obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.7 that (a) Cingular shall reimburse the Company for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in conducting the Consent/Tender Offers promptly following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs, (b) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any payments to holders of all or any portion of Specified Indebtedness or to modify the terms or provisions of any Specified Indebtedness, in each case, prior to the consummation of the Merger, or similarly incur any liability or obligation in connection therewith, except for liabilities and obligations for which Cingular has a reimbursement obligation under clause (a) above, (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective officers and directors) shall be entitled to indemnification in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to them with respect to any information relating to any Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries utilized in connection therewith, and (d) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to proceed with any Consent/Tender Offers if they would be required by Law to make any disclosure which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith is reasonably likely to not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; provided, that subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this Section 6.7 promptly following the time that -43-
such disclosure may be made, the Company shall proceed with any Consent/Tender Offer with which it had ceased proceeding. 6.8. Employee Benefits. (a) Cingular agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all Company Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than the Severance Plans) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms. For a period from the Effective Time through at least December 31, 2005, Cingular shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to those individuals who as of the Effective Time were employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than collectively bargained employees) (the "Affected Employees") compensation and employee benefits (other than payments under the Retention Pool described in Section 6.1(a)(xvii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, other similar payments or benefits made by reason of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any incremental increase in value attributable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employees immediately before the Effective Time. Cingular shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the Company's Amended and Restated Senior Officer Severance Plan in accordance with its terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement through the second anniversary of the Effective Time and the Company's Officer Severance Plan and the Company's Amended and Restated Severance Pay Plan (the three plans, collectively, the "Severance Plans") in accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time without adverse amendment for the period from the Effective Time through December 31, 2006. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Cingular, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of any of them to (x) maintain any particular Company Compensation and Benefit Plan (other than the Severance Plans), (y) grant or issue any equity or equity-based awards or (z) retain the employment of any Affected Employee. (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Cingular and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Affected Employees after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Affected Employee shall receive credit for his or her service with the Company and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for prior service), for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (but not (i) for purposes of eligibility for subsidized early retirement benefits, (ii) for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans and (iii) for any new program for which credit for benefit accrual for service prior to the effective date of such program is not given to similarly situated employees of Cingular other than the Affected Employees) to the same extent as such Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Compensation and Benefit Plans (except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the Effective Time, each Affected Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such -44-
New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Compensation and Benefit Plans in which such Affected Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Affected Employee, Cingular shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements were inapplicable to or had been satisfied by such Affected Employee and his or her covered dependants immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Old Plan, and Cingular shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. (c) Cingular hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" or a "change in control" within the meaning of each written Company Compensation and Benefit Plans that has been provided to Cingular on or prior to the date of this Agreement that contains either of such terms will occur no later than the Effective Time. (d) For the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, Cingular shall, or shall cause the Company to, cause the profit sharing formula as established under the Company profit sharing plan for such plan year to remain in effect and, subject to applicable law, cause a contribution to be made that is calculated based on performance through the Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs and annualized through the end of such plan year. Cingular shall cause, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause, each Affected Employee who is a participant in the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan and who incurs a termination of employment after the Effective Time that entitles such Affected Employee to severance benefits under any of the Severance Plans to be fully vested in his or her account balance under the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan. (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") to terminate prior to the Effective Time and to cause each participant's Periodic Deposit Account, as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan, to be returned and paid in cash at the time of termination without the purchase of any shares.

(g) Prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of Cingular and its Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. In addition, prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, Cingular shall cause to be amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following the Effective Time unless Cingular or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation.

Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally, from and after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"), in respect of acts or omissions in their capacity as such, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by Law (and Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law); provided, that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and provided, further, that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an officer or director is entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be made by independent counsel selected by Cingular and such Person. (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Cingular thereof but any failure to give such notice shall not relieve any obligation of Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the Surviving Corporation hereunder except to the extent Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the -46-
Surviving Corporation is actually prejudiced by such failure to give such notice. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither Cingular, Cingular Wireless nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation do not elect to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel and Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally agree to pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, however, that Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b) to cause Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; provided, that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will use their reasonable efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) neither Cingular, Cingular Wireless nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without Cingular's prior written consent; provided, that there shall not be any obligation under this Agreement to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. (c) The Surviving Corporation shall and Cingular shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Company's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance ("D&O Insurance") (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each such Indemnified Person covered as of the Effective Time by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof for a period of six years after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth on Schedule 6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"); provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In addition, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the existing directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company; provided, that the amount paid -47-
by the Company shall not exceed six times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Cingular and Cingular Wireless shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations under this Section 6.9(c) shall terminate. (d) The provisions of this Section 6.9 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives. (e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives under this Section 6.9 shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any other applicable Laws. (f) The obligations of Cingular, Cingular Wireless and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall not be terminated or modified by Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the Surviving Corporation in a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party. In the event that either Cingular, Cingular Wireless or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Persons, or (B) transfers at least 50% of its properties or assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. 6.10. Other Actions by the Company. (a) Rights Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all necessary action to terminate all of the outstanding Rights and to terminate the Rights Agreement, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment of any consideration in respect thereof or in respect of the Rights. (b) Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. (c) DoCoMo Investor Agreement. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall require or approve a change in the Company's use of W-CDMA technology as the primary standard for its delivery of wireless services based on 3G technology before December 31, 2004 (other than migration to successor technologies and other than for -48-
one or more of the reasons set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 4.1(a) of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action necessary to meet the 3G Launch Obligation (as defined in the DoCoMo Investor Agreement) under Section 4.1(a) of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement prior to December 31, 2004. (d) Director Resignations. The Company shall procure the resignation or removal of each of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company as of the Effective Time. (e) Regulatory Compliance. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cure not later than the Effective Time any violations and defaults under any applicable rules and regulations of the FCC (the "FCC Rules") and the FAA Rules, (ii) substantially comply with the terms of the FCC Licenses and the FAA Rules and file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all reports and other filings to be filed under applicable FCC Rules and FAA Rules and (iii) take all actions reasonably requested in writing by Cingular on or before the Closing Date to be in compliance upon the consummation of the Closing and the provisions of Sections 271 and 272 of the Communications Act (including any orders issued by the FCC interpreting or implementing such provisions). Cingular agrees that it shall reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation by the Company at the direction of Cingular pursuant to clause (iii) of the first sentence of this Section 6.10(e). (f) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement), to the extent reasonably requested by Cingular, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Cingular to facilitate the disposition immediately prior to, at or after the Effective Time of those assets or ownership interests held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are identified by Cingular in writing to the Company as assets or ownership interests the holding of which would be inconsistent with Cingular's strategic objectives (such assets or interests referred to as a "Potential Sale Interest"). To the extent reasonably requested by Cingular, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) permit Persons who Cingular identifies to the Company as potential purchasers of a Potential Sale Interest to conduct (and cooperate with such Persons') reasonable investigations with respect to such Potential Sale Interest (provided, that any such Person executes and delivers to Augusta a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms), (ii) comply with any applicable right of first refusal, right of first offer, right of approval and similar provisions that may be applicable to a proposed transfer of a Potential Sale Interest, and (iii) deliver such notices, make such filings and execute such Contracts relating to the disposition of Potential Sale Interests as reasonably requested by Cingular; provided, that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any such Contract under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to dispose of any Potential Sale Interest other than immediately prior to, at or after the Effective Time. Cingular shall be permitted to identify potential purchasers of -49-
Potential Sale Interests and negotiate any Contracts with respect to dispositions of Potential Sale Interests; provided, that the Company may (and, to the extent reasonably requested by Cingular, shall) participate in such negotiations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Cingular shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs in complying with this Section 6.10(f) promptly following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs and (B) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to breach in any material respect the terms of any Contract governing the disposition of such Potential Sale Interest.

The respective obligation of each of the Company, Cingular and Merger Sub to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the Closing of each of the following conditions: (a) Stockholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been duly adopted by holders of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote in accordance with applicable Law and the Company's certificate and by-laws. (b) Regulatory Consents. (i) The waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or been earlier terminated, (ii) all approvals and authorizations required to be obtained from the FCC for the consummation of the Merger shall have been obtained, except for those consents to be obtained from the FCC that in the aggregate are immaterial to the Company and have not been denied by the FCC, and (iii) all other Governmental Consents, the failure of which to make or obtain would, individually or in the aggregate, provide a reasonable basis to conclude that the Company or its directors or officers would be subject to the risk of criminal liability, shall have been made or obtained. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Governmental Consents" shall mean all notices, reports, and other filings required to be made prior to the Effective Time by the Company or Cingular or any of their respective Subsidiaries with, and all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, clearances and authorizations required to be obtained prior to the Effective Time by the Company or Cingular or any of their respective Subsidiaries from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. (c) Litigation. No court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law, rule, regulation, judgment, determination, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, an "Order"), except for such Orders enacted, issued, -50-
promulgated, enforced or entered by a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction solely outside of North America (i) that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in (A) a Material Adverse Effect, (B) a material adverse effect on Cingular and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (C) a material adverse effect on BellSouth or SBC and their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) the failure to comply with which would not reasonably be expected to lead to criminal prosecution of the officers of Cingular, SBC, BellSouth and their Affiliates (collectively, "Immaterial Orders"). 7.2. Conditions to Obligations of Cingular and Merger Sub. The obligation of Cingular and Merger Sub to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Cingular at or prior to the Closing of the following conditions: (a) Representations and Warranties.

No Governmental Entity shall have instituted (or if instituted, shall not have withdrawn) any proceeding or threatened to institute any proceeding seeking any Order (or if threatened, shall not have withdrawn such threat), except for Orders as would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in an Immaterial Order. (d) Governmental Consents. All Governmental Consents (other than those described in Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(ii)) the failure of which to make or obtain would, individually or in the aggregate (A) reasonably be expected to be have a material adverse effect on Cingular and its Subsidiaries, (B) reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (C) provide a reasonable basis to conclude that Cingular, Cingular Wireless, SBC or BellSouth or any of their respective directors or officers would be subject to the risk of criminal liability shall have been made or obtained (such consents together with those consents that are conditions under Section 7.1(b)(i) and (ii) hereof being the "Required Governmental Consents"). All Governmental Consents that have been obtained shall have been obtained without the imposition of any term, condition or consequence that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material Adverse Condition and all Required Governmental Consents obtained from the FCC shall have been obtained by Final Order.

(b) In the event that after the date hereof, an Acquisition Proposal (but substituting 40% for the 15% threshold set forth in the definition thereof) (a "Covered Proposal") shall have been publicly made or, after the date hereof, any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Covered Proposal and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Cingular or the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or by Cingular pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or Section 8.4(c), (i) then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days after the date of such termination, pay to Cingular on behalf of it, SBC and BellSouth and their respective Affiliates incurring charges and expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby all of the charges and expenses actually incurred by Cingular, SBC, BellSouth or their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $40,000,000 (the "Expenses") payable by wire transfer of same day funds and (ii) if, within 15 months after such termination (I) any Person (other than Cingular or any of its Affiliates) has entered into an agreement (X) to, directly or indirectly, acquire by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale, assignment, lease, transfer or similar business combination, in one transaction or any related series of transactions, 40% or more of the voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company, or ownership or control of 40% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or (Y) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions after which stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or transactions would cease to own directly or indirectly at least 60% of the voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (or of another Person that directly or indirectly would own all or substantially all the assets of the Company) immediately following such transaction in the same proportion as they owned prior to the consummation of such transaction, or (II) there has been consummated any such merger, consolidation or similar business combination or any such sale, assignment, lease or transaction between the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Cingular or any of its Affiliates), then the Company shall, promptly following such event, but in no event later than two business days after such event, pay SBC and BellSouth in proportion to their Specified Interests an aggregate termination fee of $1,400,000,000 (One Billion Four Hundred Million Dollars) (the "Termination Fee") payable by wire transfer of same day funds. Upon the payment of the Termination Fee and the Expenses, the Company shall have no further liabilities or obligations under this Section 8.5(b). The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Cingular would not -55-
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Cingular commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 8.5(b) or any portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to Cingular its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made from the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

Entire Agreement; NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Cingular Disclosure Letter, the SBC Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreements, as amended on January 9, 2004, between SBC and the Company and BellSouth and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreements"), constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF CINGULAR, MERGER SUB, SBC, BELLSOUTH OR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHER'S REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. Each of Cingular, SBC and BellSouth acknowledges that any proposal with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or similar transaction submitted after the date hereof may require the Company to make disclosures in accordance with the terms of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement and to the extent required by such agreement each consents thereto. The Company agrees that, in the event that it is required to make any disclosure in accordance with the terms of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, it shall (1) notify Cingular immediately of its intention to disclose such information to DoCoMo prior to making such disclosure, (2) disclose any such information only to the extent it is required to be disclosed pursuant to the DoCoMo Investment Agreement, (3) use its best efforts so that such information will be treated as "Proprietary Information" (as defined in the DoCoMo Investor Agreement) for purposes of Section 10.4 of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement, and (4) use its best efforts to (x) enforce its rights under Section 10.4 of the DoCoMo Investor Agreement and (y) ensure that DoCoMo does not disclose such information, except as permitted under that Section 10.4. 9.8. No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in Section 6.9 (Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance) of this Agreement, this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties who are signatories hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. -59-
9.9. Obligations of Cingular and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Cingular to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Cingular to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 9.10. Definitions. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term. 9.11. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable the remaining provisions hereof, shall, subject to the following sentence, remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to either party. Upon such determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision to effect the original intent of the parties. 9.12. Interpretation; Construction. (a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word parties when used in this Agreement shall be deemed not to include SBC and BellSouth except that the term parties shall include SBC and BellSouth for purposes of Sections 6.1(b), 6.5(b) and 8.5(b) and this Article IX. For purposes of this Agreement the terms Subsidiary and Affiliate, when used with respect to SBC and BellSouth, shall be deemed to not include Cingular and its Subsidiaries and the term Affiliate when used with respect to Cingular, Cingular Wireless and their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed not to include BellSouth, SBC or any of their respective Affiliates (other than Cingular and its Subsidiaries). (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. -60-
(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the Disclosure Letter need not be set forth in any other section of the Disclosure Letter so long as its relevance to the latter section of the Disclosure Letter or section of the Agreement is readily apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the Disclosure Letter to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. 9.13. Guarantee; Breach. SBC and BellSouth each hereby agrees to guarantee in proportion to their respective Specified Interest the payment of the Merger Consideration and any payment obligation arising as a result of a breach of this Agreement by Cingular, Cingular Wireless and Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time. The term "Specified Interest" when used in the Agreement with respect to SBC shall mean 60% and when used with respect to BellSouth shall mean 40%. The parties hereto agree that BellSouth shall not have any liability for any breach of this Agreement by SBC and SBC shall not have any liability for any breach of this Agreement by BellSouth. 9.14. Publicity. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Cingular each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or by the request of any Government Entity. 9.15. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.7, 6.10(e), 6.10(f), and 8.5 of this Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. 9.16. Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either of the parties hereto; provided, however, that Cingular may designate, by written notice to the Company, a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Cingular to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties also to be made with respect to such Subsidiary to the extent applicable as of the date of such designation. No such -61-
designation shall relieve Cingular, SBC or BellSouth of any obligation hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void ab initio. -62-
