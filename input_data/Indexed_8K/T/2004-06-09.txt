Other EventsSBC Communications Inc. ("SBC") today sold 69,436,344 million shares of Danish telecommunications provider TDC A/S ("TDC") forapproximately 12.96 billion Danish Kroners (approximately U.S.$2.1 billion at a recent exchange rate) in cash.  51,351,981 shareswere sold to certain institutional investors located in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere.  TDC also agreed to repurchase 18,084,363shares.  As a result of this transaction, SBC now owns 20,563,656 shares of TDC.  SBC has agreed to not sell these remaining sharesfor 180 days subject to exceptions for sales pursuant to: a public tender offer; TDC's share repurchase program; with the priorwritten consent of the investment banks conducting the sale to institutional investors; or to SBC's benefit plans.SBC expects to report in its second-quarter 2004 financial results a net after-tax loss of approximately $100 million.As a result of this transaction, SBC will change from the equity method of accounting to the cost method of accounting for itsremaining interest in TDC.  Accordingly, SBC will no longer record proportionate results from TDC as equity income in SBC's financialresults.  In the first quarter of 2004, SBC recorded $280 million in equity income from TDC.  This included $251 million for a gainon TDC's disposition of Belgacom, S.A ("Belgacom"), $16 million related to Belgacom results reported though TDC and combined chargesof $51 million for TDC's restructuring charges and impairment of our goodwill associated with a TDC subsidiary.
