Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
SBC Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), may issue and sell from time to time series of its debt securities registered under the registration statement referred to in Paragraph 1(a) hereof ("Securities" and individually "Security"). The Securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1994 (the "Indenture"), from the Company to The Bank of New York, as Trustee, in one or more series, which series may vary as to interest rates, maturities, redemption provisions and selling prices, with all such terms for any particular series being determined at the time of sale. The Company proposes to sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto ("Underwriters") for whom you are acting as representative(s) ("Representative"), a series of Securities, of the designation, with the terms and in the aggregate principal amount specified in Schedule I hereto ("Underwritten Securities" and, individually, "Underwritten Security").
 
1. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the several Underwriters that:
 
(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to the Securities has been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations ("Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") thereunder and has become effective. As used in this Agreement, (i) "Registration Statement" means that registration statement, as amended or supplemented to the date hereof (including all documents incorporated therein by reference); (ii) "Preliminary Prospectus" means each prospectus (including all documents incorporated therein by reference) included in that Registration Statement, or amendments thereto or supplements thereof, before it became effective under the Securities Act, including any prospectus
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the Rules and Regulations; (iii) "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus (including all documents incorporated therein by reference) included in the Registration Statement; and (iv) "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus, together with any prospectus amendment or supplement (including in each case all documents incorporated therein by reference) specifically relating to the Underwritten Securities, as filed with, or mailed for filing to, the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of Rule 424 of the Rules and Regulations. The Commission has not issued any order preventing or suspending the use of the Prospectus.
 
(b) The Registration Statement and each Prospectus contain, and (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will contain at all times during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, all statements which are required by the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations of the Commission under such Acts; the Indenture, including any amendments and supplements thereto, pursuant to which the Underwritten Securities will be issued will conform with the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and the Registration Statement and the Prospectus do not, and (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will not at any time during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that the Company makes no representation or warranty as to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use therein, or as to any statements in or omissions from the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture.
 
(c) The Company is not in violation of its corporate charter or bylaws or in default under any agreement, indenture or instrument, the effect of which violation or default would be material to the Company; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and any Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined in Paragraph 3 hereof) and compliance by the Company with the provisions of the Underwritten Securities and the Indenture will not conflict with, result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its material subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, or constitute a default under, any agreement, indenture or instrument, or result in a violation of the corporate charter or bylaws of the Company or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Company; and except as required by the Securities Act, the Trust Indenture Act and applicable state securities laws, no consent, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any court or governmental agency is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and the Indenture.
 
(d) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, there shall have not occurred any changes or any development involving a prospective change, or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which materially impairs the investment quality of the Underwritten Securities since the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
 
(e) On the Delivery Date (as defined in Paragraph 7 hereof) (i) the Indenture will have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and will constitute the legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, (ii) the Underwritten Securities will have been duly authorized and, upon payment therefor as provided in this Agreement, will constitute legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and (iii) the Underwritten Securities and the Indenture will conform to the descriptions thereof contained in the Prospectus.
 
(f) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases properties or conducts business, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.
 
(g) Except as described in the Prospectus, there is no material litigation or governmental proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries which is reasonably expected to result in any material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement.
 
(h) The financial statements filed as part of the Registration Statement or included in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus present, or (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will present at all times during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, fairly, the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, at the dates and for the periods indicated, and have been, and (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will be at all
 
times during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as described in the notes thereto).
 
(i) The documents incorporated by reference into any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus have been, and (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will be, at all times during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, prepared by the Company in conformity with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and such documents have been, or (in the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) will be at all times during the period specified in Paragraph 8(c) hereof, timely filed as required thereby.
 
(j) There are no contracts or other documents which are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Securities Act or by the Rules and Regulations, or which were required to be filed as exhibits to any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, which have not been filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or to such document or incorporated therein by reference as permitted by the Rules and Regulations or the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Exchange Act as required.
 
2. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price and on the other terms set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal amount of the Underwritten Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule II hereto.
 
3. Any offer to purchase Underwritten Securities by institutional investors solicited by the Underwriters for delayed delivery shall be made pursuant to contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, with such changes therein as the Company and the Representative may approve ("Delayed Delivery Contracts"). The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove each such institutional investor. Underwritten Securities which are subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes called "Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities" and Underwritten Securities which are not subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes called "Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities".
 
Contemporaneously with the purchase on the Delivery Date by the Underwriters of the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will pay to the Representative, for the account of the Underwriters, the compensation specified in
 
Schedule I hereto for arranging the sale of Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities. The Underwriters shall have no responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts.
 
For the purpose of determining the principal amount of Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter, there shall be deducted from the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto that portion of the aggregate principal amount of Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities that the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth therein to be purchased by all of the Underwriters (in each case as adjusted by the Representative to avoid fractions of the minimum principal amount in which the Underwritten Securities may be issued), except to the extent that the Representative determines, in its discretion, that such deduction shall be otherwise than in such proportion and so advises the Company.
 
4. [Reserved]
 
5. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Underwritten Securities except upon payment for all Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement as hereinafter provided.
 
6. If any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto to be purchased by each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter set forth therein bears to the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth therein to be purchased by all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters; provided that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities if the aggregate principal amount of Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceeds 9.09% of the total principal amount of Underwritten Securities, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto to be purchased by it. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative do not elect to purchase the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Paragraph 8(h) hereof.
 
Nothing contained in this Paragraph 6 shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If other Underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representative or the Company may postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of the Company or the Representative may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
 
7. Delivery of and payment for the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities shall be made at such address, date and time as may be specified in Schedule I hereto. This date and time are sometimes referred to as the "Delivery Date." On the Delivery Date, the Company shall deliver the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities to the Representative for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Company of the purchase price by certified or official bank check or checks payable in next-day funds settled through the New York Clearing House or such other Clearing House as is named in Schedule I. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities shall be in such form or forms and in such denominations as may be set forth in Schedule I. Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities in registered form shall be in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Representative shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the Delivery Date. For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities, the Company shall make the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities available for inspection by the Representative in New York, New York not later than 2:00 P.M., local time, on the business day prior to the Delivery Date.
 
8. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
 
(a) The Company will furnish promptly to the Representative and to counsel for the Underwriters signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and each amendment and supplement thereto filed prior to the date hereof and relating to or covering the Underwritten Securities, and a copy of the Prospectus filed with the Commission, including all documents incorporated therein by reference and all consents and exhibits filed therewith;
 
(b) The Company will deliver promptly to the Representative such reasonable number of the following documents as the Representative may request: (i) conformed copies of the Registration Statement (excluding exhibits other than the computation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, the Indenture and this Agreement), (ii) the Prospectus and (iii) any documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus;
 
(c) During any period when a Prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities is required by law to be delivered, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement nor will the Company file any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (except for (i) an amendment or supplement consisting solely of the filing
 
of a document under the Exchange Act or (ii) a supplement relating to an offering of securities other than the Underwritten Securities), unless the Company has furnished the Representative a copy of such proposed amendment or supplement for its review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which the Representative reasonably objects. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission as required pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. The Company will promptly advise the Representative (i) when the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, (ii) when any amendment of the Registration Statement shall have become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Underwritten Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will promptly (upon filing thereof) furnish the Representative a copy of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or Registration Statement not furnished to the Representative for prior review pursuant to exceptions (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of this subsection (a). The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
 
(d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Underwritten Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Registration Statement, as then amended, or the Prospectus, as then supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or to supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representative of the happening of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (c) of this Section 8, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment or supplement which will effect such compliance and (iii) will supply any such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request.
 
(e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative an earnings statement or statements of the Company which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 under the Securities Act.
 
(f) During a period of five years after the date hereof, the Company will furnish to the Representative copies of all reports and financial statements furnished by the Company to each securities exchange on which securities issued by the Company may be listed pursuant to requirements of or agreements with such exchange or to the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act or any rule or regulation of the Commission thereunder.
 
(g) The Company will endeavor to qualify the Underwritten Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Underwritten Securities, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
(h) The Company will pay the costs incident to the authorization, issuance and delivery of the Underwritten Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement and any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto; the costs of distributing the Registration Statement as originally filed and each amendment and post-effective amendment thereof (including exhibits), any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and any documents incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing documents; the costs of producing this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and the Indenture; fees paid to rating agencies in connection with the rating of the Securities, including the Underwritten Securities; the fees and expenses of qualifying the Underwritten Securities under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in this Paragraph and of preparing and printing a Blue Sky Memorandum and a memorandum concerning the legality of the Securities, including the Underwritten Securities, as an investment (including fees of counsel to the Underwriters); and all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the Company's obligations under this Agreement; provided that, except as provided in this Paragraph and in Paragraph 12 hereof, the Underwriters shall pay their own costs and expenses, including the fees and expenses of their counsel, any transfer taxes on the Underwritten Securities which they may sell and the expenses of advertising any offering of the Underwritten Securities made by the Underwriters;
 
(i) Until the termination of the offering of the Underwritten Securities, the Company will timely file all documents, and any amendments to previously filed documents, required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act; and
 
(j) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to the Delivery Date, the Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company or any guarantees or support obligations of debt securities of others, in any case with maturities longer than one year, other than Underwritten Securities to the Underwriters.
 
9. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, and any action in respect thereof, to which that Underwriter or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or arises out of, or is based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Underwriter and such controlling person for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter or controlling person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred (but no more frequently than annually); provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for use therein. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or controlling person.
 
(b) Each Underwriter shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of their directors, each of their officers who signed the Registration Statement and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, and any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or arises out of, or is based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for use therein, and shall reimburse the Company for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred (but no more frequently than annually). The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Paragraph 9 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Paragraph 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action, provided that the
 
failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Paragraph 9(a) or 9(b). If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Paragraph 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party shall not elect to assume the defense of such action, such indemnifying party will reimburse such indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include both the Company and one or more Underwriters and either (i) the indemnifying party or parties and indemnified party or parties mutually agree or (ii) representation of both the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party or parties by the same counsel is inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or in the opinion of such counsel due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party and will reimburse such indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them and satisfactory to the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative in the case of an action in which one or more Underwriters or controlling persons are indemnified parties and by the Company in the case of an action in which the Company or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons are indemnified parties. The indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable under this Agreement with respect to any settlement made by any indemnified party or parties without prior written consent by the indemnifying party or parties to such settlement.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Paragraph 9 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party under Paragraph 9(a) or 9(b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities. If, however, this allocation is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Underwritten Securities and the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in
 
such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to such offering. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Paragraph 9(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Paragraph 9(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph 9(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Paragraph 9(d) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The agreements contained in this Paragraph 9 and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 8 hereof shall survive the delivery of the Underwritten Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
10. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative, in its absolute discretion, by notice given to and received by the Company prior to the delivery of and payment for the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities, if, during the period beginning on the date hereof to and including the Delivery Date, (a) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. is suspended or materially limited, or (b) a banking moratorium is declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis or the declaration by the United States of war or a national emergency the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is material and adverse and is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to market such Underwritten Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, or (d) the Company shall have received notice that any rating of any of the Company's unsecured senior debt securities, guarantees or support obligations shall have been lowered by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined in Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act) or any such organization has publicly announced that it has under surveillance or
 
review, with possible negative implications, the ratings of any of the Company's unsecured senior debt securities, guarantees or support obligations or (e) there shall have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties of the Company or its subsidiaries which, in the Representative's reasonable judgment, materially impairs the investment quality of the Underwritten Securities.

(d) The Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel to the Company shall have furnished to the Representative his opinion addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date, as counsel, to the effect that:
 
(i) the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; each material subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
 
existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation; and each of the Company and its material subsidiaries has full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it owns or leases properties or conducts business, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;
 
(ii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity);
 
(iii) to the best knowledge of such counsel, there is no pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding before any court or governmental agency, authority, body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not adequately disclosed in the Prospectus, and there is no franchise, contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or to be filed as an exhibit, which is not described or filed as required; and the statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus describing any legal proceedings or material contracts or agreements relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries fairly summarize such matters; the Underwritten Securities, the Indenture and any Delayed Delivery Contracts conform to the descriptions thereof contained under the following (or comparable) captions of the Prospectus: "Description of Debt Securities" and "Plan of Distribution";
 
(iv) the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and are valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
 
(v) the Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities, if any, have been duly authorized and, when executed, authenticated, issued and delivered to, and paid for by, the respective purchasers thereof in accordance with the Indenture and the related Delayed Delivery Contracts, will be valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;
 
(vi) the Registration Statement and any amendments thereto have become effective under the Securities Act; to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been
 
issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened, and the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and each amendment thereof or supplement thereto as of their respective effective or issue dates (other than the financial statements and other financial and statistical information contained therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules and regulations thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereof, at the time it became effective or at the date of this Agreement or at the Delivery Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, at the date of this Agreement or at the Delivery Date, included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
(vii) this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(viii) no order, consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties is required for the issue and sale of the Underwritten Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the sale and distribution of the Underwritten Securities; and
 
(ix) neither the execution and delivery of the Indenture, this Agreement or any Delayed Delivery Contracts, the issue and sale of the Underwritten Securities, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions herein or therein contemplated nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof or thereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or by-laws of the Company or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel and to which the Company or any of its material subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, any such subsidiary or any of their assets is bound, or any order or regulation known to such counsel to be applicable to the Company or any such subsidiary of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Company or any such subsidiary.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, as to the execution of the Indenture by the Trustee, upon a certificate of the Trustee setting forth the facts as to such execution.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may also rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing believed to be reliable, provided that such counsel states in such opinion that such counsel and the Representative are justified in relying upon the opinion of such other counsel, and (B) as to matters or fact, to the extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials.
 
In rendering such opinion with respect to clause (viii) above, insofar as it relates to regulatory authorities in the states in which the Company or any material subsidiary operates, such counsel may rely on the opinions of local counsel satisfactory to such counsel.

SBC Communications Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called "SBC", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of ($) on September 15, 2009 (the "Maturity Date"), and to pay interest on said principal sum from November 3, 2004 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually
                    
                    
 
in arrears on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing on March 15, 2005 (each an "Interest Payment Date") and on the Maturity Date, at the interest rate of 4.125% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the close of business on March 1 or September 1, as the case may be (each, a "Regular Record Date"), next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Any money that SBC deposits with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of principal or any interest on this Note that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which the principal and interest are due and payable, will be repaid to SBC upon SBC's request unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any applicable unclaimed property law. After that time, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any unclaimed property law, the Holder of this Note will be able to seek any payment to which such Holder may be entitled to collect only from SBC.
 
If the Notes are issued in definitive form, payment of the principal and interest on this Note due at the Maturity Date or upon redemption will be made at the Maturity Date or upon redemption, as the case may be, upon presentation of this Note, in immediately available funds, at the office of The Bank of New York, the Paying and Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Notes, currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, and at the office of Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise, the Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent, currently located at 43, Boulevard Royal, L-2955, Luxembourg.
 
Payment of interest on this Note due on an Interest Payment Date, other than interest at maturity or upon redemption, may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Note register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Depository as Holder of the Notes or (2) a Holder of more than U.S. $5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes in definitive form is entitled to require the Paying Agent to make payments of interest, other than interest due at maturity or upon redemption, by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account maintained by the Holder in the United States, by sending appropriate wire transfer instructions as long as the Paying Agent receives the instructions not less than ten days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Trustee's Certificate of Authentication
 
This is one of the 4.125% Global Notes
of the series designated herein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of SBC of the series specified on the face hereof, issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1994, between SBC and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, SBC and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only and in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of SBC and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by SBC and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to waive compliance by SBC with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of SBC, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
Registrar and Paying Agent
 
SBC shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment or for exchange ("Paying Agent"). SBC has initially appointed the Trustee, The Bank of New York, as its Registrar and Paying Agent. In addition, SBC has appointed Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise as the Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent (the "Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent"). SBC may vary or terminate the appointment of any of its paying or transfer agencies, and may appoint additional paying or transfer agencies, but SBC will, as long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, maintain a paying and transfer agent having offices in Luxembourg. So long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, notices will be given to Holders of Notes by publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg.
 
Optional Redemption by SBC
 
The Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at SBC's option, at any time, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes. The redemption prices will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 12.5 basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolation (on a day count basis) of the interpolated Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with SBC.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers, and their respective successors and, at the option of SBC, other nationally recognized investment banking firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers. If any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we shall substitute therefore another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to a Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
 
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption, unless SBC defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, SBC will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.
 
Payment of Additional Amounts
 
SBC will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as are necessary so that the net payment by SBC or a Paying Agent of the principal of and interest on this Note to a person that is a United States Alien Holder, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the United States or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount that would have been payable in respect of the Notes had no withholding or deduction been required; , , that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:
provided
however
 
(1) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of the beneficial owner if the beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:

(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion thereof, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
 
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by SBC or a Paying Agent from the payment;
 
(5) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective after the day on which the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(6) to an estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge;
 
(7) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any paying agent (which term may include us) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent; or
 
(8) in the case of any combination of the above items.
 
Except as specifically provided herein, SBC shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendment to, any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 3, 2004, or (b) a taxing authority of the United States takes an action on or after November 3, 2004, whether or not with respect to SBC or any of its affiliates, that results in a substantial probability that SBC will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then SBC may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on any interest payment date on not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. However, SBC may determine, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay these Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless SBC shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that SBC will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and SBC shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer stating, that based on such opinion, SBC is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.

The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only and in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of SBC and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by SBC and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to waive compliance by SBC with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of SBC, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
Registrar and Paying Agent
 
SBC shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment or for exchange ("Paying Agent"). SBC has initially appointed the Trustee, The Bank of New York, as its Registrar and Paying Agent. In addition, SBC has appointed Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise as the Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent (the "Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent"). SBC may vary or terminate the appointment of any of its paying or transfer agencies, and may appoint additional paying or transfer agencies, but SBC will, as long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, maintain a paying and transfer agent having offices in Luxembourg. So long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, notices will be given to Holders of Notes by publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg.
 
Optional Redemption by SBC
 
The Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at SBC's option, at any time, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes. The redemption prices will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 15 basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolation (on a day count basis) of the interpolated Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.

"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.

Morgan Securities Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers, and their respective successors and, at the option of SBC, other nationally recognized investment banking firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers.

"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to a Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
 
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption, unless SBC defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, SBC will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date.

in arrears on March 15 and September 15 in each year, commencing on March 15, 2005 (each an "Interest Payment Date") and on the Maturity Date, at the interest rate of 6.150% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the close of business on March 1 or September 1, as the case may be (each, a "Regular Record Date"), next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Any money that SBC deposits with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of principal or any interest on this Note that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which the principal and interest are due and payable, will be repaid to SBC upon SBC's request unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any applicable unclaimed property law. After that time, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any unclaimed property law, the Holder of this Note will be able to seek any payment to which such Holder may be entitled to collect only from SBC.
 
If the Notes are issued in definitive form, payment of the principal and interest on this Note due at the Maturity Date or upon redemption will be made at the Maturity Date or upon redemption, as the case may be, upon presentation of this Note, in immediately available funds, at the office of The Bank of New York, the Paying and Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Notes, currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, and at the office of Kredietbank S.A.

Trustee's Certificate of Authentication
 
This is one of the 6.150% Global Notes of
the series designated herein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of SBC of the series specified on the face hereof, issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1994, between SBC and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, SBC and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only and in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of SBC and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by SBC and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to waive compliance by SBC with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of SBC, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
Registrar and Paying Agent
 
SBC shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment or for exchange ("Paying Agent"). SBC has initially appointed the Trustee, The Bank of New York, as its Registrar and Paying Agent. In addition, SBC has appointed Kredietbank S.A. Luxembourgeoise as the Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent (the "Luxembourg Paying and Transfer Agent"). SBC may vary or terminate the appointment of any of its paying or transfer agencies, and may appoint additional paying or transfer agencies, but SBC will, as long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, maintain a paying and transfer agent having offices in Luxembourg. So long as any of the Notes remain listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, notices will be given to Holders of Notes by publication at least once in a daily newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg.
 
Optional Redemption by SBC
 
The Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at SBC's option, at any time, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes. The redemption prices will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 20 basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
 
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolation (on a day count basis) of the interpolated Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with SBC.
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Barclays Capital Inc. and their respective affiliates which are primary U.S. Government securities dealers, and their respective successors and, at the option of SBC, other nationally recognized investment banking firms that are primary U.S. Government securities dealers. If any of the foregoing or their affiliates shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in The City of New York (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), we shall substitute therefore another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to a Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
 
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption, unless SBC defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, SBC will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.
 
Payment of Additional Amounts
 
SBC will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the Notes such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as are necessary so that the net payment by SBC or a Paying Agent of the principal of and interest on this Note to a person that is a United States Alien Holder, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or governmental charge of the United States or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, imposed by withholding with respect to the payment, will not be less than the amount that would have been payable in respect of the Notes had no withholding or deduction been required; , , that the foregoing obligation to pay additional amounts shall not apply:
provided
however
 
(1) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of the beneficial owner if the beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:
 
(a) is or was present or engaged in trade or business in the United States or has or had a permanent establishment in the United States;

(d) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of SBC;
 
(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion thereof, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
 
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
 
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by SBC or a Paying Agent from the payment;
 
(5) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective after the day on which the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(6) to an estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge;
 
(7) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any paying agent (which term may include us) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent; or
 
(8) in the case of any combination of the above items.
 
Except as specifically provided herein, SBC shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

Redemption Upon a Tax Event
 
If (a) SBC becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
 
of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendment to, any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 3, 2004, or (b) a taxing authority of the United States takes an action on or after November 3, 2004, whether or not with respect to SBC or any of its affiliates, that results in a substantial probability that SBC will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then SBC may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on any interest payment date on not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. However, SBC may determine, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay these Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless SBC shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that SBC will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and SBC shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer stating, that based on such opinion, SBC is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
 
Further Issues
 
SBC reserves the right from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Notes, to create and issue further notes ranking equally and ratably with the Notes in all respects, or in all respects except for the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of those further notes. Any further notes will have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Notes. Any further notes shall be issued pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of SBC, a supplement to the Indenture, or under an officers' certificate pursuant to the Indenture.

In either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the Notes will be entitled to the physical delivery in definitive form in exchange for this Note, equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name.
 
Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued as registered notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000, unless otherwise specified by SBC.
 
Notes so issued in definitive form may be transferred by presentation for registration to the Registrar at its New York office and must be duly endorsed by the Holder or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to SBC or the Trustee duly executed by the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
