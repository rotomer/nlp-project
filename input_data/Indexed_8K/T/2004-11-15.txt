Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 12, 2004, pursuant to Section 2.04(a) of the 364-day revolving credit agreement dated as of October 12, 2004 ("Agreement"), SBC Communications Inc. ("SBC") elected to reduce the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Agreement by $1.4 billion. Pursuant to Section 2.04(b) of the Agreement, the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Agreement will be further reduced as of November 16, 2004 by the net amount of the proceeds received on November 15, 2004 (approximately $643 million) from the disposition of assets described in Item 8.01, below.
Item 8.01.
Other Events.
SBC today closed on the sale of its remaining shares of South African telecommunications provider Telkom SA Ltd. ("Telkom") for approximately 4.0 billion Rand (approximately U.S. $643 million at a recent exchange rate) in cash. SBC will report in its fourth-quarter 2004 financial results a pre-tax loss of approximately $4 million from this sale. Net proceeds from the sale will be used to partially re-pay SBC's outstanding commercial paper borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. by Cingular Wireless.
SBC had previously agreed to not sell these remaining shares prior to the date of the release of Telkom's interim financial results, subject to various exceptions, including for sales made with the prior written consent of the investment banks that conducted the sale of a portion of SBC's shares in Telkom in June of 2004. SBC received the written consent of those investment banks before proceeding with the current sale.
