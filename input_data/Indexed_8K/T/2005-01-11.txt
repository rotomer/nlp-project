SAN ANTONIO, Jan. 11, 2005  SBC Communications Inc. (NYSE: SBC) today said that it expects its fourth-quarter 2004 reported earnings will include charges totaling approximately $250 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to previously announced work force reductions and changes to its management pension plan.
        Approximately $150 million of the total are cash charges for severance payments related to the work force reductions. During 2004, SBC had a net reduction in its total work force of more than 6,000, as the company continued to streamline and standardize operations while enhancing service. Approximately half of SBC's full-year force reduction came in the fourth quarter. SBC said in the fourth quarter that expected work force reductions could exceed 10,000 jobs through the end of 2005.
        Also, in the fourth quarter, SBC amended its management pension plan to use only its traditional service pension formula alternative for future benefit accruals. This change, which required the recognition of unamortized prior service costs associated with its cash balance pension formula alternative, is expected to result in approximately $100 million of non-cash charges.
        These charges are separate from previously announced expected merger integration and accounting costs at Cingular Wireless, of which SBC owns 60 percent.
        SBC's overall operating results for the quarter will be addressed in its earnings release scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 26, 2005.
