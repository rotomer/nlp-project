        Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
Item 2.02 Results of Operation and Financial Condition.
SBC Communications Inc. ("SBC") announced that it will record a charge against fourth quarter results to reflect the correction of an error relating to the lease accounting practices of Cingular Wireless, LLC ("Cingular"). (SBC owns a 60 percent equity ownership in Cingular.) SBC will reduce its fourth quarter Equity in net income of affiliates line item on its consolidated financial statements, which was previously reported on its Form 8-K furnished on January 26, 2005, by approximately $105 before-tax ($66 after-tax). Prior years' financial results will not be restated due to the immateriality of this adjustment to the results of operations, cash flows and financial position for the current year or any individual or prior period. This change will not affect Cingular's cash flows and is primarily related to the timing of recording rental expense which will balance out over the life of the affected operating leases.
