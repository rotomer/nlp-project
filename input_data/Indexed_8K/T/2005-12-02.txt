Item 8.01 Other Events.
 
On December 1, 2005, AT&T Inc. (formerly known as SBC Communications Inc.) reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle certain claims, principally related to the utilization of capital losses and tax credits for tax years 1997-1999, by certain AT&T Inc. entities other than AT&T Corp., which was acquired on November 18, 2005. Included in the settlement was relief from previous assessments and agreement on multiple items challenged by the IRS in the course of routine audits. As we had previously paid the assessments in full and filed refund claims with the IRS, the settlement will result in our recognition of approximately $902 million of reduced income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a corresponding increase in net income. We will leave the net refund with the IRS as a deposit against federal tax payments.
