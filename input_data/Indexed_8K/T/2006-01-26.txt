Exhibit 99.1
Dollars in millions except per share amounts
AT&T INC. Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements presented below are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AT&T Inc. (formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC)) and AT&T Corp. (ATTC). In connection with the merger, SBC changed the name of the company from "SBC Communications Inc." to "AT&T Inc." For the reader's convenience, these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements and Notes thereto refer to each company by the legal entity name prior to the merger. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are prepared using the purchase method of accounting, with SBC treated as the acquirer and as if the acquisition of ATTC had been completed on January 1, 2004 for statement of income purposes and on September 30, 2005 for balance sheet purposes. For a summary of the business combination, see "The Merger" included in the SBC Form S-4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 11, 2005 (File No. 333-123283) including all amendments and supplements to it.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are based upon the historical financial statements of SBC and ATTC adjusted to give effect to the ATTC acquisition. The pro forma amounts have been developed from (a) the audited consolidated financial statements of SBC contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of SBC contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, and (b) the audited consolidated financial statements of ATTC contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of ATTC contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of ATTC were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition, November 18, 2005. SBC has obtained preliminary third-party valuations of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (including the ATTC brand name), debt and certain other assets and liabilities. Because of the proximity of this transaction to year end, the values of certain assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations, as allowed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained. We cannot provide any assurance that such adjustments will not result in a material change.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of SBC would have been had the ATTC acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or other restructuring costs expected to result from the ATTC acquisition.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of SBC and ATTC.

AT&T INC. Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements
Note 1. Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements present the pro forma consolidated financial position and results of operations of the combined company based upon the historical financial statements of SBC and ATTC, after giving effect to the merger and adjustments described in these footnotes, and are intended to reflect the impact of the ATTC acquisition on SBC. On January 31, 2005, SBC and ATTC jointly announced the execution of the merger agreement, pursuant to which SBC would acquire ATTC in a transaction in which each share of ATTC common stock, par value of $1.00, would be converted into and exchanged for 0.77942 of a share of SBC common stock (equivalent to approximately 632 million shares, or 19% of the shares of SBC common stock that were outstanding at the merger date of November 18, 2005). Based on the average closing price of SBC common stock for the two days prior to, including, and two days subsequent to the public announcement of the merger (January 31, 2005) of $23.87, and transaction costs and other items the purchase price was approximately $15,517. ATTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBC.
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give effect to any cost savings, revenue synergies or restructuring costs which may result from the integration of SBC's and ATTC's operations.
For more information on estimated cost savings, and revenue synergies, see "The Merger  SBC's Reasons for the Merger" and "The Merger  AT&T's Reasons for the Merger" included in the SBC Form S-4 filed with the SEC on March 11, 2005 (File No. 333-123283) including all amendments and supplements to it. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Balance Sheet reflects the merger as if it had been effective on September 30, 2005 and has been restated to present trade receivables in the SBC directory business on a gross basis, a reclassification which increased "Accounts receivable  net" and "Other current liabilities" $1,150. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Income reflects the merger as if it had been in effect on January 1, 2004 and reclassifies certain ATTC expenses to conform to SBC presentation.
