On April 28, 2006, the stockholders of AT&T Inc. (the "Company") approved the 2006 Incentive Plan. A description of the 2006 Incentive Plan is included on pages 22 through 26 of the Company's Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 10, 2006, and such pages are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Effective May 3, 2006, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of AT&T Inc. (the "Certificate of Amendment"), which certificate has been included as Exhibit 3-b to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein. This amendment was approved by stockholders on April 28, 2006. The Certificate of Amendment amended Article Seven of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to remove certain super-majority voting requirements governing when the Company's Bylaws may be amended by stockholders. Article Seven, as it appeared before the amendment, is set forth below, with the language deleted by the amendment set forth in brackets.
"The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation[, except that any Bylaw of the corporation providing for the maximum number of Directors that may serve on the Board of Directors, or providing for a classified Board of Directors with staggered terms of office or requiring the approval by the shareholders or the Board of Directors of any business combination may only be amended or repealed by a two-thirds majority vote of the total number of shares of stock of the corporation then outstanding and entitled to vote]."
[ ] denotes language that was deleted.
Also effective May 3, 2006, "Article VI  Business Combinations" was removed from the Bylaws. This provision required a super-majority vote of stockholders to approve business combinations under certain circumstances. A copy of the amended Bylaws is included as Exhibit 3-c to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of Article VI of the Bylaws as that existed prior to the amendment is included as Exhibit 3-b to AT&T Inc.'s Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 5, 2005, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected.
No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7. If the Chairman determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

To be in proper written form, stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth, as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such stockholder, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record of such stockholder, and (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business.
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any business properly brought before the annual meeting. If the Chairman determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not brought properly before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

Any committee so designated may exercise the power and authority of the Board of Directors as permitted by law. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any committee and any alternate member designated to replace such member, the members of the committee present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting may by unanimous vote appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of the absent or disqualified member. Meetings of a committee may be set by the committee or may be called by one-third of the Directors then serving on the committee, the chairman of the committee, or the Chairman of the Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the person or persons calling the meeting shall fix. Notice of a committee meeting shall be given to a Director in any of the following ways: in person, by telephone or by delivery of a written notice or facsimile communication to the Director's business or residence.

communication to the Director's business or residence must be delivered at least twenty-four (24) hours before such meeting. Notice given by telephone or in person shall be given at least twelve (12) hours prior to the time set for the meeting. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of a committee need be specified in the notice of such meeting. A written waiver of any notice, signed by a Director, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be equivalent to the notice required to be given to such person. No notice is required if a committee meeting is set by the committee.
If not otherwise fixed by the Board of Directors, the number of members making up a committee shall equal the number of Directors then serving on the committee from time to time. At any meeting of a committee, a majority of the number of Directors then serving on the committee shall constitute a quorum.
Each committee may determine procedural rules for the conduct of its meetings and business, and shall act in accordance therewith, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolution establishing the committee.
