Throughout this document, the Registrant, AT&T Inc., is referred to as "we" or "AT&T."
 
Hepting Litigation
Plaintiffs filed this purported class action in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California on behalf of "all individuals in the United States that are current residential subscribers or customers of defendants' telephone services or internet services, or that were residential telephone or internet subscribers or customers at any time after September 2001,"
(Hepting, et al v. AT&T Corp., AT&T Inc. and Does 1-20)
. They allege that the defendants have disclosed and are currently disclosing to the U.S. Government records concerning communications to which Plaintiffs and class members were a party, including providing access to stored telephone and Internet records databases and permitting interception of telephone and Internet communications. Plaintiffs seek damages, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief for violations of the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and other federal and California statutes. Management believes the action is without merit and intends to vigorously defend the matter. In April 2006, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In May, the United States requested leave to intervene in this litigation, asserted the "state secrets privilege" and related statutory privileges, and filed a motion asking the court to either dismiss the complaint or issue a summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the grounds that adjudication of the claims may put at risk the disclosure of privileged national security information.
 
Since the filing of the complaint, several additional complaints have been filed in various jurisdictions making substantially the same claims, which management believes are likewise without merit.
