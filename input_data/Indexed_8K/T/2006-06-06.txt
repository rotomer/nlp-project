Item
 
8.01 Other Events.
 
Throughout this document, the Registrant, AT&T Inc., is referred to as "we" or "AT&T" and all dollar amounts are in millions.
 
AT&T is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K in order to incorporate by reference into its registration statements, including Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-118476), updated information about its pending acquisition of BellSouth Corporation ("BellSouth"). Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information as of and for the period ended March 31, 2006, derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular Wireless L.L.C. ("Cingular") and adjusted to give effect to AT&T's acquisition of BellSouth, is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Additionally, during the preparation of this updated information and after the filing of Amendment No. 2 to AT&T Inc.'s Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement"), AT&T determined that the total amount of transactions between AT&T and BellSouth should have been $199 instead of $339. (The amount of the transactions between the two companies is subtracted from both the revenue line and the expense line when determining what would be the overall amount of revenues and expenses for the combined company.) This change in the amount of these inter-company transactions will increase the Total Operating Revenues line and will increase the Cost of Sales line in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The inter-company revenue and expense adjustments are shown on page 100 (and the corresponding footnote (d1) on page 107) of the joint proxy statement/prospectus included as part of the Registration Statement.
 
As a result of this determination:
 
Although the resulting changes to Total Operating Revenues and Cost of Sales are offsetting and immaterial, AT&T has decided to highlight the change in the amount of inter-company transactions in an effort to avoid potential confusion.
 
CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this filing based on new information or otherwise.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
March 31, 2006
Dollars in millions except per share amounts
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements presented below are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not give effect to the consolidation of the YellowPages.com, which we refer to as YPC, a joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth, for which AT&T's and BellSouth's total investment was approximately $100 million at March 31, 2006. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are prepared using the purchase method of accounting, with AT&T treated as the acquirer and as if the acquisition of BellSouth had been completed on January 1, 2005 for statement of income purposes and March 31, 2006 for balance sheet purposes.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are based upon the historical financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular adjusted to give effect to the BellSouth acquisition. The pro forma amounts have been developed from (a) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of AT&T contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006, (b) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of BellSouth contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006, and (c) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Cingular contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three-month period ended March 31, 2006.
 
As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AT&T has not performed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair market value of the BellSouth assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed (which will include the fair value adjustments for BellSouth's 40 percent interest in Cingular) and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified the adjustments necessary, if any, to conform BellSouth and Cingular data to AT&T's accounting policies. As indicated in Note 2 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, AT&T has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of BellSouth and Cingular to reflect certain preliminary estimates of the fair values necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, with the excess of the purchase price over the historical net assets of BellSouth, as adjusted to reflect estimated fair values, recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements once AT&T has determined the final purchase price for BellSouth and has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any necessary conforming accounting changes for BellSouth and Cingular. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
 
Additionally, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, AT&T has not completed the final valuations included in the March 31, 2006 AT&T consolidated balance sheet. The values of certain assets and liabilities assumed in the November 18, 2005 acquisition of ATTC are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained. Such additional information includes, but is not limited to: valuations and physical counts of PP&E, valuation of investments and involuntary termination of employees. In valuing acquired assets and assumed liabilities, fair values were based on: future expected discounted cash flows for trade names and customer relationships; current replacement cost for similar capacity and obsolescence for certain fixed assets; comparable market rates for contractual obligations and certain investments, real estate and liabilities, including pension and postretirement benefits; expected settlement amounts for litigation and contingencies, and; as appropriate, discount and growth rates. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as GAAP, AT&T has 12 months from the closing of the ATTC acquisition to finalize the valuation. Changes to PP&E may result in adjustments to the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired. When finalized, material adjustments to goodwill may result.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of AT&T would have been had the BellSouth acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include the realization of future cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or other restructuring costs expected to result from the ATTC and BellSouth acquisitions.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular.

Note 1. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements present the pro forma consolidated financial position and results of operations of the combined company based upon the historical financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular, after giving effect to the BellSouth merger and adjustments described in these footnotes, and are intended to reflect the impact of the pending BellSouth acquisition on AT&T. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not give effect to the consolidation of the YPC joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth, for which AT&T's and BellSouth's aggregate total investment was approximately $100 at March 31, 2006. On March 5, 2006, AT&T and BellSouth jointly announced the execution of the merger agreement, pursuant to which AT&T would acquire BellSouth in a transaction in which each BellSouth common share would be converted into and exchanged for 1.325 AT&T common shares. Based on the average closing price of the AT&T common shares for the two days prior to, including, and two days subsequent to the public announcement of the merger (March 5, 2006) of $27.32, the purchase price would be $65,416.
 
AT&T and BellSouth jointly own Cingular, with AT&T holding a 60 percent interest and BellSouth holding a 40 percent interest. Control of Cingular is shared equally by AT&T and BellSouth. AT&T and BellSouth historically each have accounted for Cingular under the equity method of accounting, recording the proportional share of Cingular's income as equity in net income of affiliates on the respective consolidated statements of income and reporting the ownership percentage of Cingular's net assets as "Investments in and Advances to Cingular Wireless." After the merger, BellSouth and Cingular will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of AT&T.
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give effect to any cost savings, revenue synergies or restructuring costs which may result from the integration of AT&T's, BellSouth's and Cingular's operations.
 
Additionally, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include any transaction costs relating to the merger that will be included by AT&T as part of the purchase price (as those amounts are anticipated to be immaterial to the total purchase price). The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet reflects the merger as if it was completed on March 31, 2006 and includes AT&T's preliminary valuations of PP&E, intangible assets, employee benefit plans, debt and certain other assets and liabilities acquired in the November 18, 2005 ATTC acquisition. In valuing acquired assets and assumed liabilities, fair values were based on: future expected discounted cash flows for trade names and customer relationships; current replacement cost for similar capacity and obsolescence for certain fixed assets; comparable market rates for contractual obligations and certain investments, real estate and liabilities, including pension and postretirement benefits; expected settlement amounts for litigation and contingencies, and; appropriate discount and growth rates. AT&T has 12 months from the November 2005 closing of the ATTC acquisition to finalize the valuations. Finalization of the valuation and purchase price allocation of the ATTC acquisition could result in material adjustments to the AT&T consolidated balance sheet. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Income reflects the BellSouth acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2005.

Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments
 
 
 
At March 31, 2006, AT&T's total investment in Cingular was $32,316. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet has been adjusted to remove AT&T's "Investment in and Advances to Cingular Wireless" and to record, by category, AT&T's 60 percent ownership of Cingular's assets and liabilities as reported in Cingular's consolidated balance sheet included in their Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. AT&T's 60 percent ownership of Cingular's assets and liabilities remains at the existing historical book values after the merger.
 
At March 31, 2006, BellSouth's total investment in Cingular was $21,882. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet has been adjusted to remove BellSouth's "Investment in and Advances to Cingular Wireless" and to record, by category, BellSouth's 40 percent ownership of the fair value of Cingular's assets and liabilities as reported in Cingular's consolidated balance sheet included in their Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, with fair values approximating historical book values as of March 31, 2006, unless otherwise noted in a4 through a7.

to its fair value through purchase accounting adjustments. Accordingly, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet includes adjustments of $8,942 to eliminate BellSouth's 40% ownership interest in Cingular's historical goodwill and $11,220 to eliminate BellSouth's interest in Cingular's intangible assets.
 
 
The sum-of-the-months-digits method is a process of allocation, not of valuation and reflects the belief that more revenues will be generated from the assets during the earlier years of their lives. Using the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization, which records a larger portion of the amortization expense earlier in the life of the assets, the expected amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2006 was $408.

It is assumed that all stock will be new issuances. However, AT&T may issue treasury shares for a portion of the required AT&T common shares. The actual number of newly issued shares of AT&T common stock or treasury shares to be delivered in connection with the merger will be based upon the number of BellSouth common shares issued and outstanding when the merger closes.
 
 
The final purchase price allocations, which are based on third party appraisals, may result in different allocations for tangible and intangible assets than presented in these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, and those differences could be material. The following table is presented for illustrative purposes and provides the estimated annual impact on pro forma net income for every incremental $1,000 assigned to PP&E in the final purchase price allocation (since it is an illustration, the table below should not be substituted for the quarterly pro forma results shown in these pro forma financial statements). Depreciation of these assets is calculated utilizing the straight-line method over the lives shown.
 
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet reflects the reclassification of $1,595 of BellSouth's capitalized software, which was recorded as an intangible asset and to eliminate deferred activation-related revenue and expense of $1,190 (see note d2).

as possible, to periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to AT&T's future cash flow.
 
The sum-of-the-months-digits method is a process of allocation, not of valuation and reflects the belief that more revenues will be generated from the assets during the earlier years of their lives. Using the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization, which records a larger portion of the amortization expense earlier in the life of the assets, the expected amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2006 was $723.
 
The following table is presented for illustrative purposes and provides the estimated annual impact on pro forma net income for every incremental $1,000 assigned to amortizable intangible assets in the final purchase price allocation (since it is an illustration, the table below should not be substituted for the quarterly pro forma results shown in these pro forma financial statements). Amortization of these assets is utilizing the sum-of-the-months digits method over the lives shown and the first year of amortization is displayed. Expense for each year thereafter will decrease.

Pro forma combined basic earnings per common share are calculated as follows (shares in millions):
 
 
Pro forma combined diluted earnings per common share are based on the historical AT&T weighted average shares with dilution outstanding during the first quarter of 2006 of 3.9 billion and the assumption that the 2.4 billion shares and equivalents (2.39 billion shares assumed to be issued by AT&T plus 7 million BellSouth weighted average common stock equivalents converted at the exchange ratio of 1.325) were outstanding for all of the first quarter of 2006, calculated using net income.
 
Pro forma combined diluted earnings per common share are calculated as follows (shares in millions):
 
 
 
Note 3. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements assume that the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.
