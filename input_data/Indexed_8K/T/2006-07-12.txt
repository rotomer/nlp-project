Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On July 12, 2006, AT&T Inc. ("AT&T") entered into a $6 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement (the "Agreement") with certain investment and commercial banks. The available credit under the Agreement will increase by an additional $4 billion in the event AT&T completes its pending acquisition of BellSouth Corporation ("BellSouth") before March 6, 2007. This incremental amount is intended to replace BellSouth's existing credit facility which would be terminated upon completion of the acquisition. AT&T has the right to request the lenders to further increase their commitments (i.e., raise the available credit) up to an additional $2 billion provided no event of default under the Agreement has occurred. AT&T also has the right to terminate, in whole or in part, amounts committed by the lenders under the Agreement in excess of any outstanding advances; however, any such terminated commitments may not be reinstated.
 
The obligations of the lenders under the Agreement to provide advances will terminate on July 12, 2011, unless prior to that date either: (i) AT&T reduces to $0 the commitments of the lenders under the Agreement or (ii) certain events of default occur. The Agreement also provides that AT&T and all or some of the lenders may agree to extend their commitments under the Agreement for an additional one year beyond the July 12, 2011 termination date (with a potential one-year further renewal), under certain circumstances.
 
In the event advances are made under the Agreement, those advances would be used for general corporate purposes, which could include repayment of maturing commercial paper. Advances bear interest, at AT&T's option, either:
 
 
 
 
 
If AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody's, then the Applicable Margin will be 0.135% per annum and the Utilization Fee will be 0.025% per annum. If AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated A by S&P and A2 by Moody's, then the Applicable Margin will be 0.15% per annum and the Utilization Fee will be 0.05% per annum. If AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated A- by S&P (or below) and A3 by Moody's (or below), the Applicable Margin will be 0.19% per annum and the Utilization Fee will remain unchanged at 0.05% per annum.
 
AT&T will pay a facility fee ("Facility Fee") equal to 0.04% of the commitment amount per annum if its unsecured long-term debt is rated at least A+ or A1. The Facility Fee will be 0.05% per annum if AT&T's unsecured long-term debt ratings are A and A2 and will be 0.06% per annum in the event AT&T's unsecured long-term debt ratings are A- and A3 (or below).
 
In the event that AT&T's unsecured long-term debt ratings are split by S&P and Moody's, then the Facility Fee and the Applicable Margin will be determined by the higher of the two ratings, except that in the event the lower of such ratings is more than one level below the higher of such ratings, then the Facility Fee and Applicable Margin will be determined based on the level that is one level above the lower of such ratings.
 
As of the date of this filing, AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated A by S&P and A2 by Moody's. S&P and Moody's may change their ratings at any time and AT&T disclaims any obligation to provide notice of any changes to these ratings.
 
Advances under the Agreement are not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse change. Repayment of all advances must be made no later than the date on which lenders are no longer obligated to make any advances under the Agreement.
 
The Agreement contains a negative pledge covenant, which requires that, if at any time AT&T or a subsidiary pledges assets or otherwise permits a lien on its properties, advances under the Agreement will be ratably secured, subject to specified exceptions. The Agreement also contains a debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant that AT&T will maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of:
 
(a) all items that would be treated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) as indebtedness on AT&T's consolidated balance sheet, to (b) AT&T's Consolidated Net Income for such quarter plus to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period, the aggregate amount of (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation, amortization and other similar non-cash charges and (iv) extraordinary non-cash losses and minus, to the extent included in determining such Consolidated Net Income, the aggregate amount of (A) interest income, (B) income tax benefit and (C) extraordinary non-cash gains, for the four quarters then ended of not more than 3.0 to 1.
 
For purposes of this covenant, Consolidated Net Income means, for any period, the net income of AT&T and its consolidated subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis for such period in accordance with GAAP,
 
 
adjusted to exclude the effect of (a) equity gains or losses in unconsolidated entities, (b) any extraordinary or other non-recurring non-cash gain or loss (including non-cash restructuring charges and non-cash charges for discontinued operations), (c) any gain or loss on the disposition of investments, and (d) future changes to Financial Accounting Standard Nos. 87 and 106 relating to pension and postretirement benefits. In the event the Borrower acquires or disposes of a material business (as defined in the Agreement) and pro forma financial statements are provided under Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, then Consolidated Net Income would be as shown on those statements, subject to the adjustments described above.
 
Defaults under the Agreement, which would permit the lenders to accelerate required payment and which would increase the Applicable Margin by 2% per annum, include the following:
 
 
The description of the Agreement contained in these Items 1.01 and 2.03 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirely by reference to the Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 10-ll to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
This Agreement replaces AT&T's $6 billion, three-year revolving credit agreement, entered into on October 18, 2004 under AT&T's former name SBC Communications Inc. with certain investment and commercial banks, which was terminated on July 12, 2006.

provided
,

provided
,

NYDOCS02/767329
 
 
SECTION 2.12.
Payments and Computations
. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment hereunder, without counterclaim or set-off, not later than 11:00 A.M.

(c)
           
Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fee, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.
(d)
           
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender and on the date of the Assumption Agreement or the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service forms W-8BEN or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes. If the form provided by a Lender at the time such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such form;
provided

If any form or document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, that the Lender reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information. For purposes of this subsection (e), the terms "

(g)
           
Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.13 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

provided

Increasing Lender
") shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Agent on or prior to the Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment. If the Lenders notify the Agent that they are willing to increase the amount of their respective Commitments by an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the requested Commitment Increase, the requested Commitment Increase shall be allocated among the Lenders willing to participate therein based on the ratio of the amount by which each lender is willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase on the Commitment Date to the aggregate amount by which the Lenders are willing to participate in any requested Commitment Increase on the Commitment Date.
(c)
           
Promptly following each Commitment Date, the Agent shall notify the Borrower as to the amount, if any, by which the Lenders are willing to participate in the requested Commitment Increase.

Assuming Lender
") shall become a Lender party to this Agreement as of such Increase Date and the Commitment of each Increasing Lender for such requested Commitment Increase shall be so increased by such amount (or by the amount allocated to such Lender pursuant to the last sentence of Section 2.17(b)) as of such Increase Date;

(A) certified copies of resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Borrower or the Executive Committee of such Board authorizing the Commitment Increase and the corresponding modifications to this Agreement and (B) an opinion of counsel for the Borrower (which may be in-house counsel), in substantially the form of Exhibit D hereto;
(ii)

Assumption Agreement
"), duly executed by such Eligible Assignee, the Agent and the Borrower; and
(iii)
         
confirmation from each Increasing Lender of the increase in the amount of its Commitment in a writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent.
On each Increase Date, upon fulfillment of the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 2.17(d), the Agent shall notify the Lenders (including, without limitation, each Assuming Lender) and the Borrower, on or before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time), by telecopier, of the occurrence of the Commitment Increase to be effected on such Increase Date and shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Increasing Lender and each Assuming Lender on such date.

(New York City time) on the Increase Date, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the Agent's Account, in same day funds, in the case of such Assuming Lender, an amount equal to such Assuming Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) and, in the case of such Increasing Lender, an amount equal to the excess of (i) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) over (ii) such Increasing Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase) as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments (without giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase). After the Agent's receipt of such funds from each such Increasing Lender and each such Assuming Lender, the Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds to the other Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices in an amount to each other Lender such that the aggregate amount of the outstanding Advances owing to each Lender after giving effect to such distribution equals such Lender's ratable portion of the Borrowings then outstanding (calculated based on its Commitment as a percentage of the aggregate Commitments outstanding after giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase).

The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request, and each Lender shall in turn, in its sole discretion, no earlier than 30 days but not later than 20 days prior to such anniversary date, notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing as to whether such Lender will consent to such extension.

Consenting Lender
") but shall not be extended as to any other Lender (each a "
Non-Consenting Lender
"). To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the Commitment of such Lender is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.18 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person;

If after giving effect to the assignments of Commitments described above there remains any Commitments of Non-Consenting Lenders, the Borrower may arrange for one or more Consenting Lenders or other Eligible Assignees as Assuming Lenders to assume, effective as of the Extension Date, any Non-Consenting Lender's Commitment and all of the obligations of such Non-Consenting Lender under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Consenting Lender;
provided
,
however
, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Lender as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Consenting Lender is less than $10,000,000, in which case such Assuming Lender shall assume all of such lesser amount; and
provided
further
that:
(i)
            
any such Consenting Lender or Assuming Lender shall have paid to such Non-Consenting Lender (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Consenting Lender

(ii)
           
all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Consenting Lender, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Consenting Lender hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Consenting Lender; and
(iii)
         
with respect to any such Assuming Lender, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 8.6(a) for such assignment shall have been paid;
provided
further
that such Non-Consenting Lender's rights under Sections 2.10, 2.13 and 8.04, and its obligations under Section 7.05, shall survive such substitution as to matters occurring prior to the date of substitution. At least three Business Days prior to any Extension Date, (A) each such Assuming Lender, if any, shall have delivered to the Borrower and the Agent an Assumption Agreement, duly executed by such Assuming Lender, such Non-Consenting Lender, the Borrower and the Agent, (B) any such Consenting Lender shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent as to the increase in the amount of its Commitment and (C) each Non-Consenting Lender being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall have delivered to the Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Consenting Lender.

(d)
           
If (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.18) Lenders having Commitments equal to more than 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the Extension Date consent in writing to a requested extension (whether by execution or delivery of an Assumption Agreement or otherwise) not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Agent shall so notify the Borrower, and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 3.02, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one year period as described in subsection (a) of this Section 2.18, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "

"), among AT&T Inc. (the "
Borrower
"), the Lenders parties thereto and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders, I am of the opinion that:
1.
            
The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.
            
The Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity).
3.
            
Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement or the issuance of the Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment of the terms thereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or bylaws of the Borrower or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to me and to which the Borrower is a party or by which the Borrower is bound, or any applicable law, order or regulation known to me to be applicable to the Borrower of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Borrower.
4.
            
No order, consent, authorization, approval, registration or qualification of or with any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Borrower is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
5.
            
The form and terms of the Notes have been duly authorized and established by all necessary corporate action, and, when executed and delivered, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity).

6.
            
To the best of my knowledge, there is no pending or overtly threatened action, suit or proceedings against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, if likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower, that is not disclosed in a filing by the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In giving the foregoing opinion, I have assumed that at the time of any Borrowing and the execution of the Notes that any such Borrowing was in accordance with any applicable debt limitations established by the Board of Directors of the Borrower. In addition, I have relied, as to certain matters of fact, upon certificates of responsible officers of the Borrower and public officials.
Very truly yours,
