Throughout this document, the Registrant, AT&T Inc., is referred to as "AT&T."
 
On July 21, 2006, at a special meeting of stockholders of AT&T Inc., the stockholders approved the issuance of AT&T common shares required to be issued pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 4, 2006, by and among BellSouth Corporation, AT&T and ABC Consolidation Corp., a Georgia corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T ("Merger Sub"). Under the Merger Agreement, BellSouth will merge with ABC Consolidation Corp. and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T. Upon closing, BellSouth shareholders will receive 1.325 AT&T common shares for each BellSouth common share held immediately prior to the closing.
