AT&T Delivers Strong Second-Quarter Earnings Growth Driven by Merger Integration Progress, Solid Wireline Execution, Advances at Cingular Wireless
 
Note: AT&T's second-quarter earnings conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet at 10 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 25, 2006, at www.att.com/investor.relations.
 
SAN ANTONIO, July 25, 2006  AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) today reported strong second-quarter earnings growth driven by progress in merger integration, solid execution in wireline operations and increased contributions from Cingular Wireless, which is 60-percent owned by AT&T.
AT&T's second-quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.46 on a reported basis,
up 53.3 percent versus the year-earlier quarter. Before merger-related costs, earnings per diluted share were $0.58, up 34.9 percent versus comparable adjusted results in the second quarter of 2005. This marked AT&T's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per share before merger-related costs.
Second-quarter net income totaled $1.8 billion on a reported basis, up 80.8 percent from the year-earlier quarter. Before merger-related costs, earnings were $2.3 billion, up 59.6 percent from pre-merger results in the second quarter of 2005. Cash from operating activities totaled $4.7 billion, up 24.1 percent versus the year-earlier second quarter.

"We delivered another strong quarter, with excellent growth in both earnings and cash flow," said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., AT&T chairman and chief executive officer. "Cingular generated solid subscriber growth and its best-ever churn. Enterprise trends continue to be encouraging. Regional wireline revenues extended their growth record. Our SBC/AT&T merger integration projects are very much on plan, generating synergies and benefiting customers.
"These results demonstrate strong momentum as we look forward to the second half of the year and completion of our pending acquisition of BellSouth," Whitacre added. "Last week, shareowners of both companies approved the merger, and we expect to receive the remaining regulatory approvals necessary for closing the transaction this fall.
"Now that the shareowner votes are complete, we plan to ramp up the share repurchase program we outlined in March," Whitacre said. "We expect to buy back $10 billion of our shares by the end of 2007, with approximately $2 billion to $3 billion coming this year."
Consolidated Financial Results
On Nov. 18, 2005, SBC Communications Inc. completed its acquisition of AT&T Corp. and adopted AT&T Inc. as its name. Reported results for the second quarter of 2006 include costs related to this merger as well as Cingular Wireless' fourth-quarter 2004 acquisition of AT&T Wireless. In the second quarter, AT&T's portion of Cingular's $499 million of merger integration and noncash intangible amortization costs amounted to $0.05 per diluted share, and SBC/AT&T merger integration and noncash intangible amortization costs amounted to $397 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.

Major drivers of earnings-per-share growth were increased contributions from Cingular Wireless and AT&T's wireline operations, partially offset by an increased number of shares outstanding due to the acquisition of AT&T Corp. Reported results for the second quarter of 2005 do not include results from AT&T Corp.
AT&T's reported second-quarter 2006 net income was $1.8 billion versus a pre-merger $1.0 billion in the year-earlier second quarter. Excluding the items noted above, second-quarter earnings were $2.3 billion, compared with second-quarter 2005 earnings of $1.4 billion before merger-related costs.
Second-quarter consolidated revenues totaled $15.8 billion, up 53.2 percent from
a pre-merger $10.3 billion in the second quarter of 2005 and up 0.1 percent sequentially.
Second-quarter operating expenses totaled $13.2 billion on a reported basis, up from a pre-merger $8.8 billion in the year-earlier quarter but down 2.9 percent sequentially.
Expense trends reflect early results from SBC/AT&T integration and progress in operational initiatives.
Second-quarter operating income totaled $2.6 billion on a reported basis, up
71.5 percent from a pre-merger $1.5 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Before merger-related costs, operating income was $3.0 billion, up 71.1 percent versus $1.8 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
AT&T's second-quarter operating income margin was 16.5 percent on a reported basis, up from 14.7 percent in the year-earlier second quarter. Before merger-related expenses, AT&T's operating income margin was 19.0 percent versus 17.0 percent in the second quarter of 2005.
AT&T's second-quarter cash from operating activities totaled $4.7 billion, up 24.1 percent from $3.8 billion the year-earlier quarter. Year to date, cash from operations totaled $7.2 billion, up 42.0 percent from $5.0 billion in the first half of 2005.
Wireline Highlights
AT&T's wireline segment includes the combined former SBC and former AT&T Corp. wireline operations. Second-quarter 2006 wireline results reflect continued solid progress in merger integration, expanded margins and revenue trends that were consistent with first-quarter 2006 results.

Total wireline revenues in the second quarter were $14.8 billion, up 59.3 percent versus a pre-merger $9.3 billion reported in the second quarter of 2005 and up 0.1 percent from results in the first quarter of this year.
In addition to reported results, AT&T is providing supplementary quarterly wireline revenue comparisons to pro forma results for 2005 to give investors additional background on trends in the business. These pro forma revenues combine results from the former SBC and the former AT&T Corp., with segments and categories consistent in all periods.
Versus pro forma results for the second quarter of 2005, AT&T's second-quarter 2006 wireline revenues declined 5.0 percent. This compares with a 5.5 percent year-over-year pro forma decline in the first quarter of this year. More than two-thirds of AT&T's year-over-year wireline revenue decline in the second quarter came from former AT&T Corp. national mass markets  primarily stand-alone long distance and local bundled services  where AT&T Corp. discontinued proactive marketing in 2004. Excluding results from this customer category, wireline revenues declined 1.8 percent year over year and grew 0.7 percent sequentially.

expansion of its AT&T U-verse

services in San Antonio, the first market where the services are commercially available. AT&T U-verse services include next-generation television (IPTV) and high speed Internet offerings powered by Project Lightspeed, the company's initiative to expand its fiber-optics network deeper into neighborhoods. AT&T is pleased with initial results and expects to offer its U-verse services in 15 to 20 markets (metropolitan statistical areas) within its traditional 13-state wireline area by the end of 2006. Markets beyond San Antonio are expected to be launched late in the fourth quarter, generally following the deployment plan being used in San Antonio.
Wireline revenue comparisons reflect the movement of certain accounts during the second quarter of 2006 between customer categories, resulting in reclassified revenues between those categories for the current and past quarters. These movements correspond with changes in how the company serves customers as it continues to integrate operations. The changes affect previously reported revenues and trends in several customer categories and include moving $138 million of fourth-quarter 2004 carrier revenues from the enterprise customer category to wholesale. Total quarterly wireline revenues and product revenues were not affected by the changes. Additional adjustments may take place in future quarters as the company further integrates operations. Financial data that include the changes are on the Investor Relations page of AT&T's Web site under the heading "Financial & Operational Results."
Wireless Results
Cingular Wireless' second-quarter results were driven by continued strong subscriber growth, its lowest-ever churn levels and further margin expansion as it integrates operations and strengthens network performance. In the second quarter:

As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for joint ventures, AT&T includes Cingular Wireless' results in the Equity in Net Income of Affiliates line of its Consolidated Statements of Income rather than in consolidated revenues and expenses.

BellSouth Acquisition, Expanded Share Repurchase
On July 21, 2006, AT&T Inc. and BellSouth Corporation received approval from their stockholders for AT&T to acquire BellSouth. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulatory authorities and to other customary closing conditions. AT&T expects to receive the remaining approvals needed for the transaction to close by this fall.
AT&T announced in March that it expects to buy back $10 billion of its common shares by the end of 2007, and it expects approximately $2 billion to $3 billion of the repurchases to occur during 2006. This repurchase is intended to approximate the share premium paid to BellSouth stockholders as part of this transaction. The timing and nature of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and applicable securities laws.
Updated Financial Outlook
Based on first-half results and current trends, AT&T has updated portions of the 2006 financial outlook it provided in January.

These updated expectations do not include any expected impacts from AT&T's pending acquisition of BellSouth. As outlined in March when its plans to acquire BellSouth were announced, AT&T continues to expect double-digit adjusted EPS growth in each of the next three years, starting with 2006, along with significant growth in free cash flow after dividends. (After the BellSouth merger, free cash flow after dividends will be cash from operations less capital expenditures and dividends.)
