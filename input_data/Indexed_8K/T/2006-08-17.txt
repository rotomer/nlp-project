CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this filing based on new information or otherwise.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
 
AT&T's pro forma ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 was 3.46. At June 30, 2006 no preferred stock was outstanding.
 
The pro forma calculation of ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006 is derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular using the purchase method of accounting. AT&T is treated as the acquirer and assumes the acquisition of BellSouth had been completed on January 1, 2006. For purposes of calculating this ratio, the undistributed earnings from equity investments held by the above mentioned companies are included.
 
The historical ratios of earnings to fixed charges for each of the five years ended December 31, 2005 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2006 are set forth in AT&T's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, which is incorporated by reference herein.

AT&T INC.
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
June 30, 2006
Dollars in millions except per share amounts
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements presented below are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of AT&T Inc. (AT&T), BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) and Cingular Wireless LLC (Cingular). The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not give effect to the consolidation of the YellowPages.com, which we refer to as YPC, a joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth, for which AT&T's and BellSouth's total investment was approximately $100 at June 30, 2006. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are prepared using the purchase method of accounting, with AT&T treated as the acquirer and as if the acquisition of BellSouth had been completed on January 1, 2005 for statement of income purposes and June 30, 2006 for balance sheet purposes.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are based upon the historical financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular adjusted to give effect to the BellSouth acquisition. The pro forma amounts have been developed from (a) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of AT&T contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006, (b) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of BellSouth contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006, and (c) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Cingular contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006.
 
As of the date of this document, AT&T has not performed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair market value of the BellSouth assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed (which will include the fair value adjustments for BellSouth's 40 percent interest in Cingular) and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified the adjustments necessary, if any, to conform BellSouth and Cingular data to AT&T's accounting policies. As indicated in Note 2 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, AT&T has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of BellSouth and Cingular to reflect certain preliminary estimates of the fair values necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, with the excess of the purchase price over the historical net assets of BellSouth, as adjusted to reflect estimated fair values, recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements once AT&T has determined the final purchase price for BellSouth and has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any necessary conforming accounting changes for BellSouth and Cingular. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
 
Additionally, as of the date of this document, AT&T has not completed the final valuations included in the June 30, 2006 AT&T consolidated balance sheet. The values of certain assets and liabilities assumed in the November 18, 2005 acquisition of AT&T Corp. (ATTC) are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained. Such additional information includes, but is not limited to: valuations and physical counts of PP&E, valuation of investments and involuntary termination of employees. In valuing acquired assets and assumed liabilities, fair values were based on: future expected discounted cash flows for trade names and customer relationships; current replacement cost for similar capacity and obsolescence for certain fixed assets; comparable market rates for contractual obligations and certain investments, real estate and liabilities, including pension and postretirement benefits; expected settlement amounts for litigation and contingencies, and; as appropriate, discount and growth rates. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which we refer to as GAAP, AT&T has 12 months from the closing of the ATTC acquisition to finalize the valuation. Changes to PP&E may result in adjustments to the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired. When finalized, material adjustments to goodwill may result.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of AT&T would have been had the BellSouth acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include the realization of future cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or other restructuring costs expected to result from the ATTC and BellSouth acquisitions.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular.

Note 1. Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements present the pro forma consolidated financial position and results of operations of the combined company based upon the historical financial statements of AT&T, BellSouth and Cingular, after giving effect to the BellSouth merger and adjustments described in these footnotes, and are intended to reflect the impact of the pending BellSouth acquisition on AT&T. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not give effect to the consolidation of the YPC joint venture between AT&T and BellSouth, for which AT&T's and BellSouth's aggregate total investment was approximately $100 at June 30, 2006. On March 5, 2006, AT&T and BellSouth jointly announced the execution of the merger agreement, pursuant to which AT&T would acquire BellSouth in a transaction in which each BellSouth common share would be converted into and exchanged for 1.325 AT&T common shares. Based on the average closing price of the AT&T common shares for the two days prior to, including, and two days subsequent to the public announcement of the merger (March 5, 2006) of $27.32, the purchase price would be $65,597.
 
AT&T and BellSouth jointly own Cingular, with AT&T holding a 60 percent interest and BellSouth holding a 40 percent interest. Control of Cingular is shared equally by AT&T and BellSouth. AT&T and BellSouth historically each have accounted for Cingular under the equity method of accounting, recording the proportional share of Cingular's income as equity in net income of affiliates on the respective consolidated statements of income and reporting the ownership percentage of Cingular's net assets as "Investments in and Advances to Cingular Wireless." After the merger, BellSouth and Cingular will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of AT&T.
 
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give effect to any cost savings, revenue synergies or restructuring costs which may result from the integration of AT&T's, BellSouth's and Cingular's operations.
 
Additionally, the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements do not include any transaction costs relating to the merger that will be included by AT&T as part of the purchase price (as those amounts are anticipated to be immaterial to the total purchase price). The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet reflects the merger as if it was completed on June 30, 2006 and includes AT&T's preliminary valuations of PP&E, intangible assets, employee benefit plans, debt and certain other assets and liabilities acquired in the November 18, 2005 ATTC acquisition. In valuing acquired assets and assumed liabilities, fair values were based on: future expected discounted cash flows for trade names and customer relationships; current replacement cost for similar capacity and obsolescence for certain fixed assets; comparable market rates for contractual obligations and certain investments, real estate and liabilities, including pension and postretirement benefits; expected settlement amounts for litigation and contingencies, and; appropriate discount and growth rates. AT&T has 12 months from the November 2005 closing of the ATTC acquisition to finalize the valuations. Finalization of the valuation and purchase price allocation of the ATTC acquisition could result in material adjustments to the AT&T consolidated balance sheet. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Income reflects the BellSouth acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2005.

Note 2. Pro Forma Adjustments
 
 
 
At June 30, 2006, AT&T's total investment in Cingular was $32,656. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet has been adjusted to remove AT&T's "Investment in and Advances to Cingular Wireless" and to record, by category, AT&T's 60 percent ownership of Cingular's assets and liabilities as reported in Cingular's consolidated balance sheet included in their Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. AT&T's 60 percent ownership of Cingular's assets and liabilities remains at the existing historical book values after the merger.
 
At June 30, 2006, BellSouth's total investment in Cingular was $22,108. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet has been adjusted to remove BellSouth's "Investment in and Advances to Cingular Wireless" and to record, by category, BellSouth's 40 percent ownership of the fair value of Cingular's assets and liabilities as reported in Cingular's consolidated balance sheet included in their Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, with fair values approximating historical book values as of June 30, 2006, unless otherwise noted in a4 through a7.

The sum-of-the-months-digits method is a process of allocation, not of valuation and reflects the belief that more revenues will be generated from the assets during the earlier years of their lives. Using the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization, which records a larger portion of the amortization expense earlier in the life of the assets, the expected amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $791.

Price per share is based on the average closing price of the AT&T common shares for the    two days prior to, including and two days subsequent to the first trading day following    public announcement of the merger on March 5, 2006.

It is assumed that all stock will be new issuances. However, AT&T may issue treasury shares for a portion of the required AT&T common shares. The actual number of newly issued shares of AT&T common stock or treasury shares to be delivered in connection with the merger will be based upon the number of BellSouth common shares issued and outstanding when the merger closes.
 
 
The final purchase price allocations, which are based on third party appraisals, may result in different allocations for tangible and intangible assets than presented in these Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, and those differences could be material. The following table is presented for illustrative purposes and provides the estimated annual impact on pro forma net income for every incremental $1,000 assigned to PP&E in the final purchase price allocation. Depreciation of these assets is calculated utilizing the straight-line method over the lives shown.
 
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet reflects the reclassification of $1,606 of BellSouth's capitalized software, which was recorded as an intangible asset and to eliminate deferred activation-related revenue and expense of $1,155 (see note d2).

as possible, to periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to AT&T's future cash flow.
 
The sum-of-the-months-digits method is a process of allocation, not of valuation and reflects the belief that more revenues will be generated from the assets during the earlier years of their lives. Using the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization, which records a larger portion of the amortization expense earlier in the life of the assets, the expected amortization expense for the six months ended June 30, 2006 was $1,403.
 
The following table is presented for illustrative purposes and provides the estimated annual impact on pro forma net income for every incremental $1,000 assigned to amortizable intangible assets in the final purchase price allocation (since it is an illustration, the table below should not be substituted for the quarterly pro forma results shown in these pro forma financial statements). Amortization of these assets is utilizing the sum-of-the-months digits method over the lives shown and the first year of amortization is displayed. Expense for each year thereafter will decrease.

Pro forma combined basic earnings per common share are calculated as follows (shares in millions):
 
 
Pro forma combined diluted earnings per common share are based on the historical AT&T weighted average shares with dilution outstanding during the first six months of 2006 of 3.9 billion and the assumption that the 2.41 billion shares and equivalents (2.4 billion shares assumed to be issued by AT&T plus 7 million BellSouth weighted average common stock equivalents converted at the exchange ratio of 1.325) were outstanding for all of the first six months of 2006, calculated using net income.
 
Pro forma combined diluted earnings per common share are calculated as follows (shares in millions):
 
 
 
Note 3. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements assume that the merger qualifies as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes.

NOTE A - PREPARATION OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
In this report, BellSouth Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as "we", "the Company", or "BellSouth."
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. In our opinion, these statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be the same as those for the full year. For a more complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information, you should read this report in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
Certain amounts within the prior year's information have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
 
NOTE B  RECENTLY ISSSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. This Interpretation is effective for BellSouth beginning January 1, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact FIN 48 will have on our financial statements.
 
NOTE C - EARNINGS PER SHARE
 
Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Nonvested restricted stock carries dividend and voting rights and, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), is not included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to compute basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus net incremental shares arising out of employee stock compensation and benefit plans. The earnings amounts used for per-share calculations are the same for both the basic and diluted methods. The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average share amounts (in millions) used in calculating earnings per share:
 
 
Options with an exercise price greater than the average market price of the common stock or that have an anti-dilutive effect on the computation are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Restricted stock or restricted stock units that have an anti-dilutive effect on the computation are also excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
 
NOTE D  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
In March 2004, we signed an agreement with Telefnica Mviles, S.A., the wireless affiliate of Telefnica, S.A., to sell all of our interests in Latin America. During 2004, we closed on the sale of 8 of the 10 properties. During January 2005, we closed on the sale of the operations in the remaining two Latin American countries for gross proceeds of $1,077 and a gain of $390, net of tax. The gain includes the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $68.

Summarized results of operations for the discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2005 are as follows:
 
 
NOTE E - MERGER OF BELLSOUTH AND AT&T
 
On March 4, 2006, we agreed to merge with a subsidiary of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) in a transaction in which each share of BellSouth common stock will be exchanged for 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock. The stock consideration in the transaction is expected to be tax-free to our shareholders. Our shareholders approved the merger in July 2006. The acquisition, which is subject to approval by regulatory
authorities, and other customary closing conditions, is currently expected to close in the fall of 2006. However, it is possible that factors outside of our control could require us to complete the merger at a later time or not to complete it at all. The terms of certain of our agreements, including contracts, employee benefit arrangements and debt instruments, have provisions which could result in changes to the terms or settlement amounts of these agreements upon a change in control of BellSouth.
 
NOTE F - INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO CINGULAR WIRELESS
 
Investment
We own a 40 percent economic interest in Cingular Wireless, a joint venture with AT&T. Because we exercise influence over the financial and operating policies of Cingular Wireless, we use the equity method of accounting for this investment. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our proportionate share of Cingular Wireless' earnings in our consolidated statements of income. These earnings are included in the caption "Net earnings (losses) of equity affiliates."
 
The following table displays the summary financial information of Cingular Wireless. These amounts are shown on a 100 percent basis.
 
 
 
As of June 30, 2006, our book investment exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of Cingular Wireless by $456.
 
Advance
We have an advance to Cingular Wireless that, with interest, totaled $2,622 at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2006. This advance earns an interest rate of 6.0 percent per annum and matures on June 30, 2008.

NOTE F - INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO CINGULAR WIRELESS (Continued)
 
Revolving Line of Credit
BellSouth and AT&T provide unsubordinated short-term financing on a pro rata basis for Cingular Wireless' ordinary course of business cash requirements. Under the terms of the line of credit, Cingular Wireless' available cash (as defined), if any, is applied first to repay amounts loaned to Cingular Wireless under the line of credit. Remaining available cash is applied to the repayment of the advance described above. Borrowings bear interest at 1-Month LIBOR plus 0.05 percent payable monthly. The line of credit terminates on July 31, 2007. Borrowings from BellSouth under the revolving credit line, including interest, were $204 at December 31, 2005 and $681 at June 30, 2006.
 
Provision of Services
We also generate revenues from Cingular Wireless in the ordinary course of business for the provision of local interconnection services, long distance services, sales agency fees and customer billing and collection fees.
 
Interest and Revenue Earned from Cingular Wireless:
 
Interest income on advances are offset by a like amount of interest expense recorded by Cingular Wireless and reported in our financial statements in the caption "Net earnings (losses) of equity affiliates."
 
Receivables and payables incurred in the ordinary course of business are recorded on our balance sheets as follows:
 
 
NOTE G - DEBT
 
On January 18, 2005, we redeemed $400 of 40-year, 6.75 percent debentures, due October 15, 2033. The redemption price was 103.33 percent of the principal amount, and resulted in recognition of a loss of $22, or $14 net of tax, which includes $9 associated with fully expensing remaining discount and deferred debt issuance costs.
 
On May 18, 2005 we redeemed $300 of 40-year, 7.625 percent debentures, due May 15, 2035. The redemption price was 103.66 percent of the principal amount, and resulted in recognition of a loss of $20, or $12 net of tax, which includes $9 associated with fully expensing remaining discount and deferred debt issuance costs.
 
NOTE H - WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING
 
Based on competitive activity in the telecommunications industry, continued economic pressures, realignment of our business and productivity improvements, we have periodically initiated workforce reductions and recorded charges for early termination benefits.
 
In December 2005, we announced that we would reduce our management workforce by approximately 1,500 employees. The plan included a voluntary program offering a special termination benefit followed by an involuntary program to the extent necessary to achieve the targeted reductions. As a result of the pending merger of BellSouth and AT&T, we modified the terms of the fourth quarter 2005 announced workforce reduction by eliminating the involuntary component that was scheduled to follow the voluntary offer. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2006 we reversed the minimum liability accrued (except with respect to the 60 employees who had already accepted under that program). Based on the acceptances of the voluntary offer, we accrued $73 for the second quarter of 2006 and $127 for the first half of 2006. Under the modified plan, we reduced our management workforce by approximately 1,350 employees. This reduction program was substantially complete at the end of June 2006.
 
In addition, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $24 for non-management surpluses announced in the first and second quarters of 2006.

NOTE H - WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING (Continued)
 
The following table summarizes activity associated with the workforce reduction and restructuring liability for the six months ended June 30, 2006:
 
 
Adjustments to the employee separations accrual are due to the reversal noted above as well as estimated demographics being different than actual demographics of employees that separated from the Company.
 
NOTE I - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS
 
Substantially all of our employees are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans. We provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits to substantially all retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially-determined postretirement benefit costs as active employees earn these benefits. Management employees hired after January 1, 2001 are provided access to medical benefits at retirement but are required to pay 100 percent of the cost.
 
The following details pension and postretirement benefit costs included in operating expenses (in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Approximately 10 percent of these costs are capitalized to property, plant and equipment with labor related to network construction. We account for these costs in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Components of net periodic benefit costs were as follows:
 
 
 
Employer Contributions
Due to the funded status of our pension plans, we do not expect to make contributions to these plans in 2006. Consistent with prior years, we expect to contribute cash to the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts to fund other benefit payments. During the six months ended June 30, 2006, we contributed $179 to fund these other benefits and expect to contribute approximately $150 to $200 during the remainder of 2006.

Cash Balance Pension Plans
In July 2003, a Federal district court in Illinois ruled that the benefit formula used in International Business Machines Corporation's (IBM) cash balance pension plan violated the age discrimination provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Subsequent opinions of several other U.S. district courts have conflicted with that court's view, while others have agreed. Congress is presently considering legislation that could clarify the legal status of cash balance plans under the applicable age discrimination rules. At this time, it is unclear what effect, if any, these decisions or possible Congressional action may have on our tax-qualified cash balance pension plans or our financial condition.
 
NOTE J - STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
 
We have granted stock-based compensation awards to key employees under several plans. One share of BellSouth common stock is the underlying security for any award under these plans. Under the stock plan approved by shareholders in 2004, the maximum number of shares available for future grants is limited to 80 million reduced by awards granted and increased by shares tendered in option exercises. In 2003, we used the retroactive restatement method provided by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure," to adopt the expense recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," (SFAS No. 123) by restating all periods beginning on or after January 1, 1995 (the effective date of SFAS No. 123). Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," (SFAS No. 123R) using the modified prospective application of its provisions; therefore, our financial statements for prior periods will not be restated. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R was immaterial. Because we previously adopted the expense recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, the impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R resulted in essentially three changes: (1) use of an estimated forfeiture rate versus recognition of actual forfeitures as incurred, (2) use of fair value to measure expense for awards classified as liabilities, and (3) use of the alternative transition method to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies in future years, which increased the pool by $130. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we instituted a policy of recognizing expense for awards with graded vesting provisions using the straight-line method of expense attribution.
 
Given trends in long-term compensation awards and market conditions, over the last few years we have moved toward granting a mix of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share units in lieu of stock options. The table below summarizes the total compensation cost and the related total tax benefit included in our results of operations for each type of award:
                                                            
 
Stock Option Awards
Stock options granted under the plans entitle recipients to purchase shares of BellSouth common stock within prescribed periods at a price either equal to, or in excess of, the fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable at the end of three to five years, have a term of ten years, and provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the plans). The grant date fair value of each option granted, which is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula, is expensed over the vesting period. A summary of option activity under the plans is presented below:

NOTE J - STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued)
 
As of June 30, 2006, total compensation cost related to unvested stock options of $3 is expected to be amortized by the end of 2006. Information related to stock option exercises is provided below:
 
 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted to key employees under the plans are settled by issuing shares of common stock at the vesting date. Generally, the restrictions lapse in full on the third anniversary of the grant date, or on a pro rata basis on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. The vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units accelerates if there is a change in control (as defined in the plans) and the employee is terminated or resigns for good cause within two years of the change in control. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock and restricted stock units, which is the stock price on the grant date, is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The shares represented by restricted stock awards (but not restricted stock unit awards) are considered outstanding at the grant date, as the recipients are entitled to dividends and voting rights. A summary of restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity under the plans is presented below:
 
 
The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted during the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2006 was $26.47 and $34.13, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2006 was $26.05 and $31.86, respectively. As of June 30, 2006, the total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units of $76 is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 17 months. Information related to shares vested is provided below:
 
 
Performance Share Unit Awards
Performance share units granted to key employees are settled in cash based on an average stock price at the end of the three-year performance period multiplied by the number of units earned. The number of performance share units actually earned by recipients is based on the achievement of certain performance goals as defined by the terms of the awards, and can range from 0% to 150% of the number of units granted. At the end of the performance period, recipients also receive a cash payment equal to the dividends paid on a share of BellSouth stock during the performance period for each performance share unit earned. Vesting accelerates and the performance period is modified if there is a change in control (as defined in the plans). For awards granted prior to 2006, performance share unit expense is generally recognized over the performance period; for awards granted in 2006, performance share unit expense is recognized over the vesting period, which approximates the performance period. Since performance share units are settled in cash, our obligations related to these awards are classified as liabilities. A summary of performance share unit activity under the plans is presented below:

Effective with the adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, the amount of expense recognized for all unvested performance share units is based on the fair value of the performance shares at each reporting date and, as applicable, the expected outcome of performance conditions. The fair value of each performance share unit is determined at the grant date and at each reporting date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The simulation model includes ranges of assumptions for stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends. Expected volatilities for the three unvested awards are estimated based on a blend of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and are currently estimated at 19%. The risk-free interest rate for periods within each performance period is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the valuation date and currently ranges from 5.10% to 5.24%. Expected dividends are estimated based on historical patterns of increases.
 
The weighted-average fair value of unvested performance share units as of June 30, 2006 was $40.57, and the total unrecognized compensation cost of $183, based on this value, is expected to be amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately 18 months. Information related to performance share units vested and paid is provided below:
 
 
NOTE K - SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
We have three reportable operating segments: (1) Communications Group; (2) Wireless; and (3) Advertising & Publishing Group. We own a 40 percent economic interest in Cingular Wireless, and share joint control of the venture with AT&T. We account for the investment under the equity method. For management purposes we evaluate our Wireless segment based on our proportionate share of Cingular Wireless' results. Accordingly, results for our Wireless segment reflect the proportional consolidation of 40 percent of Cingular Wireless' results.
 
The Company's chief decision makers evaluate the performance of each business unit based on segment net income, exclusive of internal charges for use of intellectual property and adjustments for unusual items that may arise. Unusual items are transactions or events that are included in reported consolidated results but are excluded from segment results due to their nonrecurring or nonoperational nature.
 
The following table provides information for each operating segment:

In most of our sale and divestiture transactions, we indemnify the purchaser for various items including labor and general litigation as well as certain tax matters. Generally, the terms last one to five years for general and specific indemnities and for the statutory review periods for tax matters. The events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the indemnity are transaction and circumstance specific. We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued for expected losses that are probable. In addition, in the normal course of business, we indemnify counterparties in certain agreements. The nature and terms of these indemnities vary by transaction. Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of indemnities.
 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
Regulatory-related claims
In May 2005, we sued AT&T in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia for unpaid access charges associated with AT&T's prepaid calling cards and its "IP in the middle" services that use Internet Protocol technology for internal call processing but use the public switched network to originate and terminate calls. The lawsuit follows two separate rulings by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), one in April 2004 concerning "IP in the middle'' services and one in February 2005 concerning prepaid card services, that each service was a telecommunications service subject to access charges. AT&T estimated in securities filings that it had "saved'' $340 in access charges on its prepaid card services and $250 in access charges on its "IP in the middle'' services. We believe that some of the improperly avoided access charges should have been paid to us for the use of our network. AT&T appealed the FCC's decision relating to the prepaid card services to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which denied the appeal in July 2006. If the U.S. District Court lawsuit in Georgia progresses, we expect to obtain information from AT&T and other sources that will determine the amount of BellSouth access charges AT&T avoided. In addition, AT&T has asserted certain defenses against BellSouth and has filed the New York lawsuit described below in an effort to reduce any amount it may owe to BellSouth. In April 2006, BellSouth and AT&T agreed to stay the U.S. District Court lawsuit in Georgia until the earlier of 12 months or the consummation or termination of the Merger Agreement between BellSouth and AT&T. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of gain, if any, be made. Accordingly, no revenue has been recognized with respect to this matter in our consolidated financial statements.

On November 4, 2005, AT&T sued BellSouth Long Distance, Inc. (BSLD) and Qwest Communications Corporation (Qwest) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. AT&T has asserted claims of breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment against BSLD and related claims against Qwest. AT&T's claims arise from a contract with BSLD pursuant to which BSLD purchased wholesale long distance minutes that it resold to Qwest. The complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought by AT&T. The parties have agreed to stay the New York lawsuit pending the arbitration of the dispute between AT&T and BSLD. To date, no arbitration has been initiated by AT&T. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.
 
In June 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed the District Court's dismissal of most of the antitrust and state law claims brought by a plaintiff competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in a case captioned
Covad Communications Company, et al v. BellSouth Corporation, et al.
The appellate court, however, permitted a price squeeze claim and certain state tort claims to proceed. In November 2005, Covad dismissed with prejudice the civil action and then contemporaneously filed complaints with the public service commissions of Florida and Georgia and filed an informal complaint with the FCC. The commission complaints allege breaches of our interconnection contracts approved by the state commissions, including failure to provide collocation, mishandling of orders, ineffective support systems, and failure to provide unbundled loops. The complaints also allege improper solicitation of Covad customers. These claims are similar to the claims raised in the civil action dismissed by Covad. The complaints seek credits and equitable relief. Covad has asked the state commissions to stay proceedings on its complaints pending resolution of its FCC complaint. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.
 
Employment claim
On April 29, 2002, five African-American employees filed a putative class action lawsuit, captioned
Gladys Jenkins et al. v. BellSouth Corporation,
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint alleges that BellSouth discriminated against current and former African-American employees with respect to compensation and promotions in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 USC Section 1981. Plaintiffs purport to bring the claims on behalf of two classes: a class of all African-American hourly workers employed by BellSouth Telecommunications at any time since April 29, 1998, and a class of all African-American salaried workers employed by BellSouth Telecommunications at any time since April 29, 1998 in management positions at or below Job Grade 59/Level C. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified amounts of back pay, benefits, punitive damages and attorneys' fees and costs, as well as injunctive relief. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.
 
Securities and ERISA claims
From August through October 2002, several individual shareholders filed substantially identical class action lawsuits against BellSouth and three of its senior officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The cases have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and are captioned
In re BellSouth Securities Litigation
. Pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the court has appointed a Lead Plaintiff. The Lead Plaintiff filed a Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint in July 2003 on behalf of two putative classes: (1) purchasers of BellSouth stock during the period November 7, 2000 through February 19, 2003 (the class period) for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and (2) participants in BellSouth's Direct Investment Plan during the class period for alleged violations of Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. Four outside directors were named as additional defendants. The Consolidated and Amended Class Action Complaint alleged that during the class period the Company (1) overstated the unbilled receivables balance of its Advertising & Publishing subsidiary; (2) failed to properly implement Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101 with regard to its recognition of Advertising & Publishing revenues; (3) improperly billed CLECs to inflate revenues; (4) failed to take a reserve for refunds that ultimately came due following litigation over late payment charges; and (5) failed to properly writedown goodwill of its Latin American operations.
 
On February 8, 2005, the District Court dismissed the Exchange Act claims, except for those relating to the writedown of Latin American goodwill. On that date, the District Court also dismissed the Securities Act claims, except for those relating to the writedown of Latin American goodwill, the allegations relating to unbilled receivables of the Company's Advertising & Publishing subsidiary, the implementation of SAB 101 regarding recognition of Advertising & Publishing revenues and alleged improper billing of CLECs. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.

In February 2003, a similar complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia on behalf of participants in BellSouth's Direct Investment Plan alleging violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act. Defendants removed this action to federal court pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. In July 2003, the federal court issued a ruling that the case should be remanded to Fulton County Superior Court. The Fulton County Superior Court has stayed the case pending resolution of the federal case. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.
 
In September and October 2002, three substantially identical class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against BellSouth, its directors, three of its senior officers, and other individuals, alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The cases have been consolidated and on April 21, 2003, a Consolidated Complaint was filed. The plaintiffs, who sought to represent a putative class of participants and beneficiaries of BellSouth's 401(k) plans (the Plans), allege in the Consolidated Complaint that the company and the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of ERISA, by among other things, (1) failing to provide accurate information to the Plans' participants and beneficiaries; (2) failing to ensure that the Plans' assets were invested properly; (3) failing to monitor the Plans' fiduciaries; (4) failing to disregard Plan directives that the defendants knew or should have known were imprudent and (5) failing to avoid conflicts of interest by hiring independent fiduciaries to make investment decisions. In October 2005, plaintiffs' motion for class certification was denied. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs. Certain underlying factual allegations regarding BellSouth's Advertising & Publishing subsidiary and its former Latin American operation are substantially similar to the allegations in the putative securities class action captioned
In re BellSouth Securities Litigation,
which is described above.
 
Subject to approval of the court, the parties have reached a settlement of the ERISA lawsuits. The settlement is on behalf of the Plans and certain participants who brought claims individually and on behalf of the Plans pursuant to ERISA section 502(a)(2). BellSouth does not expect the settlement to have a material effect on the Company. The principal terms of the settlement increase the minimum levels below which Company matching contributions may not fall for a three-year period. The settlement does not require any other unreimbursed cash payments by the Company.
 
Antitrust claims
In December 2002, a consumer class action alleging antitrust violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act was filed against BellSouth, Verizon, AT&T (formerly known as SBC) and Qwest, captioned
William Twombly, et al v. Bell Atlantic Corp., et al,
in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that defendants conspired to restrain competition by agreeing not to compete with one another and to impede competition with others. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of treble damages and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and expenses. In October 2003, the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. In October 2005, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision and remanded the case to the District Court. In June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari. At this time, the likely outcome of the case cannot be predicted, nor can a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss, if any, be made.
 
Merger-related claims
On March 9, 2006, two putative class action lawsuits, entitled Williams v. BellSouth Corporation, et al., Case No. 2006CV113858 (March 9, 2006) and Jannett v. BellSouth Corporation, et al., Case No. 2006CV113861 (March 9, 2006), were filed against BellSouth and its directors in the Superior Court of Georgia, Fulton County. The complaints, as subsequently amended and consolidated, purported to be brought on behalf of all BellSouth shareholders (excluding defendants and their affiliates). The plaintiffs alleged that BellSouth's directors violated their fiduciary obligations to BellSouth's shareholders in approving the merger agreement, and by failing to provide material information or by providing materially misleading information in connection with the preliminary proxy statement filed by BellSouth and AT&T with the SEC on March 31, 2006. The consolidated complaint sought various forms of relief, including injunctive relief to prevent the completion of the merger, unspecified compensatory damages, and attorneys' fees and expenses. In July 2006, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the suit.
 
Other claims
We are subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business involving allegations of personal injury, breach of contract, anti-competitive conduct, employment law issues, regulatory matters and other actions. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. is also subject to claims attributable to pre-divestiture events, including environmental liabilities, rates and contracts. Certain contingent liabilities for pre-divestiture events are shared with AT&T. While complete

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
For a more complete understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business and our current period results, you should read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in conjunction with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and our other filings with the SEC.
 
Overview
We are a Fortune 500 company with annual revenues of over $20 billion. Our core businesses are wireline and wireless communications and our largest customer segment is the retail consumer. We have interests in wireless communications through our ownership of 40 percent of Cingular Wireless, the nation's largest wireless company based on number of customers and revenue. We also operate one of the largest directory advertising businesses in the United States. The majority of our revenues are generated based on monthly recurring services.
 
We operate much of our wireline business in one of the country's strongest regional economies, where the population is increasing, real income growth is outpacing the national average and a diverse mix of businesses require advanced information and communication technology solutions. The Southeast is a positive net migration region, with net migration averaging almost 500,000 annually. The region's real income growth is expected to exceed the national average over the next five years.
 
INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
 
Demand in the traditional voice business has been negatively impacted by the proliferation of wireless services led by one-rate pricing plans that include a large bucket of minutes and free roaming and long-distance, the popularity of e-mail and instant messaging, and technological advances such as broadband. After a period of significant growth in the 1990s, access lines, a key driver of our business, have declined steadily since 2001.
 
While the last mile connectivity to the customer remains essential, the communications industry is transitioning from a network-centric circuit-based infrastructure to an applications-centric IP infrastructure, which could create uncertainty around traditional business models. Further, industry consolidation, such as the recent combinations of SBC and AT&T, Verizon and MCI, and Sprint and Nextel, and the pending merger of BellSouth and AT&T, are creating large competitors with global reach and economies of scale.
 
Based on comparisons to penetration rates in other parts of the world, there is still significant growth potential in the wireless market in the United States. There are currently four national wireless companies engaging in aggressive competition in a growing market. The intense competition has driven down pricing, increased costs due to customer churn and increased wireless usage as companies attempt to differentiate their service plans. Meanwhile, significant capital is being invested in networks to meet increasing demand and to upgrade capabilities in anticipation of the development of new data applications.
 
REGULATION AND COMPETITION
Our core businesses are subject to regulation, and all of our businesses are subject to vigorous competition.
 
Changes to federal law in the early 1990s generally preempted states from regulating the market entry or rates of a wireless carrier, while allowing states to regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service. Wireless carriers are also subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which allocates the spectrum used by wireless carriers, and adopts and enforces other policies relating to wireless services.
 
Our wireline business is subject to dual state and federal regulation. The FCC has historically engaged in heavy regulation of our interstate services. In recent years, it has granted increasing pricing flexibility for our interstate telecommunications services because of the additional competition to which those services are subject, though nearly all of the services remain subject to tariffing requirements. Separately, in response to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC initially required us to share our network extensively with local service competitors, and prescribed a pricing policy (TELRIC) that has not permitted fair cost recovery. These sharing (unbundling) rules were invalidated by the courts on three separate occasions, but not before the invalid policies had been generally implemented in our contracts with competitors. In February 2005, the FCC issued rules that cut back significantly on some of the anticompetitive sharing requirements. The new rules essentially eliminated the unbundled network platform, or UNE-P, a combination of unbundled elements that replicate local service at unfairly low prices.
 
During 2005 and early 2006, we transitioned most former UNE-P customers to a similar platform service at commercially negotiated terms and prices. Our completion of the FCC-ordered phase out is being litigated before certain state commissions.
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
 
The FCC provided additional relief when it released new broadband rules effective in November 2005 that responded to a U.S. Supreme Court decision. The new rules are designed to provide our high speed Internet access services with regulation equivalent to that of our competition, particularly cable modem providers. The new rules are scheduled to be fully phased in by the third quarter of 2006, although the FCC reserved the right to extend the transition.
 
The states in our region continue to exert economic regulation over much of the revenue generated by our traditional narrowband wireline telecommunications services, though that regulation has been lessening. During the past two years, state legislatures and state regulatory commissions have taken action that moved regulation toward equivalence with our telecommunications competitors by prohibiting state regulation of broadband services, rebalancing rates, and reducing regulation of service bundles.
 
Despite these successes, our wireline business remains more regulated than competing businesses that use cable, wireless or non-facilities based technologies. While we welcome the reforms, the transition of our wireline business regulation from the comprehensive, utility-like regulation of previous years to standard business regulation is not complete, and adjusting to each individual change requires significant management attention. We will accordingly continue to encourage regulatory reform in every appropriate forum.
 
Competition in the yellow pages industry continues to intensify. Major markets are seeing multiple competitors, with many different media competing for advertising revenue. We continue to respond to the increasing competition and the dynamic media environment with investments in product enhancements, multiple delivery options, local promotions, customer value plans, increased advertising and sales execution.
 
MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
 
On March 4, 2006, we agreed to merge with a subsidiary of AT&T. In the merger, shareholders of BellSouth will receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each share of BellSouth common stock. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors and shareholders of each company. The transaction is subject to review by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and approval by the FCC and various other regulatory authorities. We currently expect the transaction to close in the fall of 2006. We expect the combined company to be a more effective and efficient provider in the wireless, broadband, video, voice and data markets. It will also put control of Cingular Wireless in one company.
 
We have completed the exit of our international operations and increased our investment in the wireless market through Cingular Wireless' acquisition of AT&T Wireless. The addition of AT&T Wireless filled in Cingular Wireless' national coverage footprint, added depth to its licensed spectrum position, and added size and scale to compete more effectively. Cingular Wireless' new advertising campaigns combined with improvements in customer service and network coverage are driving customer loyalty and growth. Customer churn has reduced appreciably, integration efforts are well underway and cost synergies are contributing to margin expansion. This acquisition substantially increases BellSouth's participation in the wireless industry, bringing wireless to over 40 percent of our proportional revenues including Cingular Wireless. As Cingular completes its integration of AT&T Wireless and executes its strategy, we expect its contribution to BellSouth's earnings to increase.
 
HIGHLIGHTS AND OUTLOOK
 
Consolidated revenues, which do not include our share of Cingular, increased 1.2 percent in the second quarter of 2006 and 1.4 percent year-to-date compared to the same periods of 2005, attributable to growth in both the Communications Group and Advertising & Publishing Group. Revenue growth driven by DSL, long distance and wholesale wireless transport services, as well as by electronic media and print services, effectively offset revenue declines from retail residence and wholesale voice access line losses. We added 128,000 net DSL customers and 120,000 long distance customers during the second quarter of 2006. We served nearly 3.3 million total DSL customers and approximately 7.5 million long distance customers at June 30, 2006. At June 30, 2006 we had more than 5 million residential packages with 86 percent of packages including long distance and 49 percent having either FastAccess DSL or BellSouth dial-up Internet.
 
Seasonal loss patterns, technology substitution and competition from cable telephony providers continued to drive access line losses in the second quarter of 2006. Total retail access lines were down 279,000, which included 251,000 of lines losses in consumer and positive retail small business line growth of 25,000 offset by a 48,000 decline in retail large business. Wholesale access lines declined 181,000 compared to March 31, 2006 influenced by the change in regulatory position towards UNE-P.
 
Our cost structure is heavily weighted towards labor and fixed asset related costs. We have adjusted our workforce due to shifts in market share of access lines. Since the beginning of 2001, we have reduced our domestic workforce by slightly more than 19,000 employees, or 24 percent. Excluding the impacts of hurricanes, our year-to-date wireline operating margins have improved year-over-year. Sustaining our margins will require continued market penetration of new services and improvements in productivity to manage our costs as competition and technology substitution intensifies.

Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $3,562 for the first half of 2006 was $258 lower than the same period in 2005. Capital expenditures were $2,031 for the first half of 2006 and $1,579 for the first half of 2005. The increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior period relates primarily to increased spending for broadband investments in infrastructure and systems and expenditures of approximately $265 for Hurricane Katrina restoration efforts in the first half of 2006. Operating cash flows in the second half of 2006 will be negatively impacted by higher federal income tax payments.
 
Cingular Wireless
 
Cingular Wireless added nearly 1.5 million net customers in the second quarter of 2006, bringing its nationwide customer base to 57.3 million customers. Customer churn of 1.7 percent in the second quarter of 2006 decreased 50 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. Year-over-year revenue growth exceeded 7 percent driven by subscriber growth partially offset by a decline in average revenue per user (ARPU). Operating margin has been improving due to revenue growth and operating efficiencies from integration synergies and rationalization efforts, reduced network costs related to the T-Mobile joint venture unwind, and declining customer list amortization.

Operating revenues
 
Consolidated operating revenues increased $64 in the second quarter of 2006 and $144 year-to-date compared to the same periods in 2005 reflecting growth in DSL, long distance, wholesale wireless transport services and electronic media and print services. These increases were partially offset by the impact of revenue declines associated with retail residence and wholesale voice access line losses due to competition and technology substitution. Combined revenues from DSL and long distance increased $178 in the second quarter and $328 year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. Electronic media and print revenues grew $16 in the second quarter of 2006 and $31 year-to-date compared to the same periods last year. Other voice and access line-related revenues declined $135 in the second quarter of 2006 and $228 year-to-date compared to the same periods in 2005.
 
Revenue trends are discussed in more detail in the Communications Group and Advertising & Publishing Group segment results sections.

Operating expenses
 
Total operating expenses increased $109 in the second quarter of 2006 and $295 year-to-date compared to the same periods of the prior year. Expenses were impacted by $65 of incremental severance-related costs in the second quarter of 2006, $50 year-to-date, associated with recently completed voluntary management workforce reductions as well as $27 of costs directly associated with the pending merger with AT&T. Additionally, $25 of incremental service restoration and network repair costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2006, $198 year-to-date, from weather-related damage. These weather-related costs are net of $20 in insurance recoveries for the second quarter of 2006, $40 year-to-date, as well as a $13 adjustment to the reserve for Hurricane Katrina-related uncollectibles. Business expansion costs at the Advertising & Publishing Group and incremental uncollectibles drove $9 of higher expenses in the second quarter of 2006 and $29 year-to-date compared to the same periods of 2005. The year-over-year operating expense comparison benefited from $18 lower depreciation and amortization in the second quarter of 2006 and $43 year-to-date associated with reduced depreciation rates.
 
Operating expense trends are discussed in more detail in the Communications Group and Advertising & Publishing Group segment results sections.
 
Interest expense
 
                
Interest expense associated with interest-bearing debt was lower in the second quarter and year-to-date periods of 2006 compared to the same periods of the prior year. This was primarily the result of lower average debt balances, substantially offset by higher interest rates on variable rate debt. The higher average debt balances in 2005 were due to the incremental borrowings in late 2004 associated with our equity contributions to Cingular to fund its acquisition of AT&T Wireless.
 
Net earnings (losses) of equity affiliates
 
 
The increase in earnings from Cingular Wireless in 2006 was attributable to growth in the customer base and merger synergies associated with its increased scale and integration of the former AT&T Wireless operations. See the Wireless segment results section for a further discussion of operational drivers. The decline in earnings from other equity investees is due to the sale of our interest in Cellcom in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Other income (expense), net
 
 
The decline in interest on advances to Cingular was attributable to principal repayments, partially offset by rate increases. Interest income on advances to Cingular is offset by a like amount of interest expense recorded by Cingular and reported in our financial statements in the caption "Net earnings (losses) of equity affiliates."
 
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
Provision for income taxes
 
 
The lower effective rate in both periods of 2006 reflects year-over-year increases in tax benefits associated with the dividends received deduction for our investment in Cingular, the release of a valuation allowance against state net operating losses, the Medicare Part D subsidy, and a tax benefit for production activities conducted within the U.S. Current year increases in these benefits were partially offset by the tax impacts of a state law change enacted during the second quarter of 2006.
 
Income from discontinued operations, net of tax
 
In the first quarter of 2005, we sold the final two of the ten Latin American properties, which resulted in a $390 gain, net of tax.
 
Results by Segment
 
Our reportable segments reflect strategic business units that offer similar products and services and/or serve similar customers. We have three reportable operating segments:
 
 
The Company's chief decision makers evaluate the performance of each business unit based on net income, exclusive of internal charges for use of intellectual property and adjustments for unusual items that may arise. Unusual items are transactions or events that are included in reported consolidated results but are excluded from segment results due to their nonrecurring or nonoperational nature. Such items are listed in the table of summary results for each segment. In addition, when changes in our business affect the comparability of current versus historical results, we adjust historical operating information to reflect the current business structure. See Note K to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment results to the consolidated financial information.
 
The following discussion highlights our performance in the context of these segments. For a more complete understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes.

Communications Group
 
The Communications Group is our core domestic business and it includes all domestic wireline voice, data, broadband, long distance, Internet services and advanced voice features. The Communications Group provides these services to an array of customers, including residential, business and wholesale.
 
BellSouth continues to focus its marketing on long distance and BellSouth FastAccess DSL, encouraging customers to purchase packages containing multiple telecommunications services. We also continue to experience access line market share loss due to competition and technology substitution, and we expect these overall trends to continue throughout 2006.

Segment operating revenues
 
In the second quarter of 2006, growth in consumer long distance and DSL revenue was partially offset by retail residential access line losses, resulting in a 2.5 percent year-over-year increase in consumer revenue. Revenue for our small business unit increased 9.8 percent in the second quarter of 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005. We continue to reacquire and retain customers with competitively priced term agreements while also increasing customer ARPU with FastAccess DSL and long distance packages. Revenue for our large business segment was essentially flat in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period last year. We experienced revenue growth in emerging data products and long distance offsetting declines in core voice and data products. Pricing pressures and, to a lesser extent, volume pressure contributed to the decline in the core product groups. Wholesale revenue decreased 5.0 percent in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year as a lower UNE-P access line base led to revenue erosion. These negative trends were somewhat offset by growth in wireless transport.
 
Voice
Voice revenues decreased $53 in the second quarter of 2006 and $78 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. Access line-related revenues declined $94 in the second quarter of 2006 and $172 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005 due to total switched access line losses of 1,461,000, or 7.0 percent. The access line decline was the result of continued share loss, wireless and broadband technology substitution and, to a lesser extent, losses to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. Wholesale lines totaled almost 1.9 million at June 30, 2006, down 760,000 year over year. Wholesale lines consist primarily of both the grandfathered service provided under invalidated FCC rules (UNE-P) and successor service provided under commercial contracts at negotiated rates. Commercial contracts covered predominately all of the wholesale lines at June 30, 2006.
 
In efforts to combat share loss, we continue to further penetrate our customer base with package services. At the end of the second quarter of 2006, we had more than 5 million residential packages, representing a nearly 46 percent penetration of our retail primary line residence base. As of June 30, 2006, 86 percent of our package customers had long distance in their package and 49 percent had either FastAccess DSL or BellSouth dial-up Internet.
 
Long distance voice revenue increased $82 in the second quarter of 2006 and $150 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005, driven primarily by growth in interLATA retail revenues and wholesale long distance services sold to Cingular. InterLATA retail revenues increased $57 in the second quarter and $109 year-to-date reflecting continued market share gains driven by marketing efforts and the BellSouth Unlimited Long Distance Plans. At June 30, 2006, we had nearly 7.5 million retail long distance customers and a mass-market penetration rate of over 61 percent of our retail customer base.
 
Switched access revenues decreased $20 in the second quarter of 2006 and $30 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. Declines in volumes were offset by intrastate usage. Our entry into interLATA long distance shifted switched access minutes from other carriers to our service, resulting in a transfer from wholesale switched access revenues to retail long distance revenue. Excluding our retail long distance traffic, switched access and local minutes of use decreased 4.4 percent in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2005. The decrease is due to access line losses and alternative communications services, primarily wireless and e-mail.
 
Data
Data revenues increased $117 in the second quarter of 2006 and $221 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. Data revenues were driven primarily by strong growth from the sale of BellSouth FastAccess DSL service. Combined wholesale and retail DSL revenues of $400 in the quarter and $782 year-to-date were up $113 and $202, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2005 due primarily to a larger customer base partially offset by lower ARPU. As of June 30, 2006, we had nearly 3.3 million DSL customers, an increase of 800,000 customers compared to June 30, 2005. DSL net subscriber additions were 128,000 in the second quarter of 2006. More than 25 percent of BellSouth's broadband customers subscribe to the Company's premium service offerings -- FastAccess DSL Xtreme and FastAccess DSL Xtreme 6.0.
 
Revenue from other retail data products increased $12 in the second quarter of 2006 and $27 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. Revenue from our long distance offerings in complex business and emerging data services, particularly BellSouth Metro Ethernet Service and BellSouth Virtual Private Network, were the primary drivers. While pricing pressures continue to impact legacy products, the rate of price declines is moderating.
 
Revenue from the sale of wholesale data transport services, including long distance companies and competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC), declined $10 in the second quarter of 2006 and $9 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. Data transport sold to inter-exchange carriers declined as they continue to reduce their network costs in response to declining volumes. In addition, dial-up Internet Service Provider (ISP) traffic revenue declined as volumes declined. These declines were offset by revenue growth in transport sold to wireless carriers as wireless subscribers and volumes continue to expand.

Other
Other revenues decreased $16 in the second quarter of 2006 and $34 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005 reflecting wholesale long distance volume declines.
 
Segment operating expenses
 
Cost of services and products
Cost of services and products decreased $2 in the second quarter of 2006 and increased $91 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. The second quarter decrease includes a $19 decrease in fees related to penalties associated with CLEC parity requirements and contributions to the Universal Service Fund (USF) and a decrease of $14 in labor costs. These decreases were offset by increases of $16 in contract services predominately related to network repairs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Wilma which struck southern Florida in late October 2005, and $15 in materials and supplies related to increased fuel costs and DSL modems.
 
The year-to-date increase reflects a $106 increase in contract services predominately related to network repairs associated with damage caused by Hurricane Wilma, $26 in materials and supplies related to increased fuel costs and DSL modems, and $19 in cost of goods sold driven by higher volumes in long distance service. These increases were partially offset by a $46 reduction in penalties associated with CLEC parity requirements, USF contributions and access fees.
 
Selling, general, and administrative expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $4 in the second quarter of 2006 and remained flat year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005. The second quarter decrease reflects a $12 decrease in uncollectibles and a $12 decrease in right-to-use fees partially offset by a $10 increase in sales commissions due to increased volumes.
 
The year-to-date expenses remained flat as increases in contract services, advertising and sales commissions were offset by decreases in labor, uncollectibles and fees.
 
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $20 during the second quarter of 2006 and $44 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005 reflecting reduced depreciation rates under the group life method of depreciation partially offset by depreciation expense on new capital expenditures in the previous 12 months.
 
Wireless
 
We own a 40 percent economic interest in Cingular Wireless, a joint venture with AT&T. Because we exercise influence over the financial and operating policies of Cingular Wireless, we use the equity method of accounting for this investment. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our proportionate share of Cingular Wireless' earnings in our consolidated statements of income. These earnings are included in the caption "Net earnings (losses) of equity affiliates." For management purposes, we evaluate our Wireless segment based on our proportionate share of Cingular Wireless' results. Accordingly, results for our Wireless segment reflect the proportional consolidation of 40 percent of Cingular Wireless' financial results.
 
The wireless industry continued its strong growth trajectory seen in 2005 during the first half of 2006. Despite industry consolidation, competition continues to be intense among the current four national competitors, their affiliates and the smaller regional carriers. Cingular Wireless' ARPU declined 3.3 percent in the second quarter of 2006 and 2.8 percent year-to-date from the corresponding prior year periods driven primarily by lower voice ARPU partially offset by increased data ARPU. Data revenue continues to play an increasingly important role in revenue composition, rising from 8.2 percent of ARPU during the second quarter of 2005 to 11.8 percent of ARPU in the second quarter of 2006.

Segment operating revenues
 
Cingular Wireless had net additions of 1.5 million during the second quarter of 2006, up from 1.0 million during the second quarter of 2005 and 3.2 million net additions year-to-date up from 2.3 million in the corresponding prior year period. This resulted in 57.3 million cellular/PCS customers on June 30, 2006. Gross customer additions during the second quarter of 2006 totaled 4.4 million and totaled 9.2 million year-to-date, up slightly from the same periods a year ago. The slight increase in gross customer additions was primarily driven by new prepaid offerings launched in mid-2005 and strong reseller gross additions, partially offset by decreased postpaid additions due to planned distribution rationalization such as the reduction of retail stores and agents.
 
The cellular/PCS churn rate was 1.7 percent for the second quarter of 2006 and 1.8 percent year-to-date, down from 2.2 percent in both corresponding prior year periods. Postpaid churn for both the second quarter of 2006 and year-to-date was 1.5 percent, down from 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent in the corresponding prior year periods. The decline in cellular/PCS churn was driven by a 12.7 percent reduction in disconnects in the second quarter of 2006 and a 10.1 percent reduction in disconnects year-to-date in comparison to the same periods of 2005, which Cingular believes is attributed primarily to better network quality and coverage.
 
Cellular/PCS ARPU declined 3.3 percent to $48.84 in the second quarter and 2.8 percent to $48.66 year-to-date, down from $50.51 and $50.06 in the corresponding prior year periods. This decline was driven by adding a disproportionately higher percentage of lower-ARPU prepaid and reseller customers than postpaid customers over the past three quarters, an increase in the number of customers on plans allowing free mobile-to-mobile calling, and a higher percentage of customers on lower access revenue FAMILYTALK plans. These factors were partially offset by incremental revenue drivers related to data products such as ring tones and messaging.
 
Segment operating revenues, consisting of service revenue and equipment sales, increased $244 in the second quarter of 2006 and $544 year-to-date when compared with the same periods of 2005. The growth in service revenue of $231 during the second quarter of 2006 and $465 year-to-date was primarily due to the increases in local service voice and data revenues partially offset by decreases to roaming and other revenue. The local service voice component of total service revenues includes recurring monthly access charges, airtime usage, including prepaid service, and charges for optional features and services, such as voice mail, mobile-to-mobile calling, roadside assistance, caller ID and handset insurance. It also includes billings to Cingular Wireless' customers for the USF and other regulatory fees and taxes. The key driver of the $118 increase in local service voice revenues in the second quarter of 2006, $254 year-to-date, was an increase of 11.3 percent for the second quarter of 2006 and 10.9 percent year-to-date in the average number of cellular/PCS subscribers. This volume-based increase was partially offset by the incremental impact of a disproportionate amount of lower-ARPU prepaid and reseller customers added to the base.
 
 
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
Increases in data revenues also favorably impacted total service revenues. Data revenues, which increased $134 in the second quarter of 2006 and $255 year-to-date over the same prior year periods driven by greater data service penetration and usage of short message service (SMS) messaging and other data services by Cingular Wireless' cellular/PCS customers.
 
Roaming revenues decreased $28 in the second quarter of 2006 and $41 year-to-date when compared with amounts from the corresponding prior year periods. Roaming revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by the bundling of "free" roaming minutes with all-inclusive regional and national rate plans.
 
Long distance revenues for the second quarter of 2006 increased $9 from the corresponding prior year period due primarily to an increase in international long distance revenues. Long distance revenue year-to-date increased $14 from the corresponding prior year period due to an increase in both international and domestic long distance revenues.
 
Equipment sales, comprised of product, accessory and upgrade sales, contributed $13 during the second quarter of 2006 and $79 year-to-date to the increase in total operating revenues. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by a higher volume of upgrades and higher priced handsets despite lower postpaid gross additions and related equipment volumes compared to the corresponding prior year periods.
 
Segment operating expenses
 
Cost of services and products
Cost of services and products increased $110 in the second quarter of 2006 and $187 year-to-date when compared to the same periods of 2005 primarily driven by increased network usage and sales of higher-end, higher cost customer handsets.
 
The local systems component increased $38 in the second quarter of 2006 and $67 year-to-date when compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Both increases resulted primarily from higher interconnection fees of $26 associated with a 19.2 percent growth in system minutes in the second quarter of 2006 and $68 associated with a 20.9 percent growth in system minutes year-to-date over the prior year corresponding periods; an increase in USF fees from a higher contribution rate of $17 in second quarter of 2006 and $2 year-to-date; and an increase in local network system costs of $14 in second quarter of 2006 and $24 year-to-date primarily related to increased network system usage and associated expansion costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in reseller services expense of $17 in the second quarter of 2006 and $26 year-to-date in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in reseller services expense was driven by decreases in minutes of use on the T-Mobile network of 49 percent in the second quarter of 2006 and 46 percent year-to-date offset by higher handset insurance claims in both periods when compared to the same periods of the prior year.
 
Third-party network system costs increased $24 for the second quarter of 2006 resulting from a $6 increase in roaming expense and $18 increase in long distance expense over the corresponding prior year period. Third-party network system costs increased $60 year-to-date when compared to the same period of the prior year resulting from increases of $26 in roaming expense and $34 of long distance expense compared to the prior year period. Roaming costs increased due to increased volumes and prices over the comparable prior periods. Increases in long distance were driven by higher volumes of minutes of use resulting from the increased number of average subscribers, partially offset by rate decreases.
 
Equipment sales expenses grew $48 in second quarter 2006 and $60 year-to-date when compared to the same periods of the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average cost per unit sold of product, accessory and upgrade equipment driven by higher-end handsets, despite a lower volume of postpaid gross additions.
 
Selling, general, and administrative expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $54 in the second quarter of 2006 and $94 year-to-date when compared to the same periods of 2005. Selling expenses decreased $6 in the second quarter of 2006 and $7 year-to-date compared to the prior year corresponding periods driven by advertising and net commissions decreases. Costs for maintaining and supporting Cingular Wireless' customer base decreased $41 in the second quarter of 2006 and $65 year-to-date when compared to the same periods of 2005 principally due to a decrease in bad debt primarily from improved collections driving lower net write-offs, and a decrease in customer service costs due to reduced outsourced professional services at call centers in both periods. Additionally, administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of headcount reductions and a federal excise tax refund accrued in the second quarter of 2006 pursuant to guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
 
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation expense increased $48 in the second quarter of 2006 and $39 year-to-date when compared to the same periods in 2005 primarily due to Cingular Wireless' increased network investment and reduction in depreciation expense recorded in 2005 from the revaluation of acquired AT&T Wireless assets pursuant to the network rationalization plans substantially offset by the impact of assets being fully depreciated in 2006. Amortization expense decreased $4 for the
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
second quarter of 2006 and $8 year-to-date primarily due to amortization associated with intangible assets that became fully amortized during 2005.
 
Advertising & Publishing Group
 
Our Advertising & Publishing Group is comprised of companies in the US that publish, print, and sell advertising in and perform related services concerning alphabetical and classified telephone directories and electronic media offerings.
 
In the second quarter of 2006, our Advertising & Publishing Group continued to see the favorable impact from strategic initiatives implemented in prior years, partially offset by continued competitive pressures and delayed publication in the New Orleans market.
 
 
* Not meaningful
 
Segment operating revenues
 
Segment operating revenues increased $16 in the second quarter of 2006 and $31 year-to-date compared to the same periods of 2005. These increases include an improvement in print revenues as a result of core print growth and new products and growing electronic media revenues.
 
Segment operating expenses
 
Cost of services and products decreased $2 in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily reflecting the two-month delay of publication in the New Orleans market. Cost of services and products was essentially flat year-to-date compared to the same period of the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $11 in the second quarter of 2006 and $27 year-to-date compared to the same periods of the prior year primarily driven by increases in selling, advertising and facilities for sales growth and expansion initiatives and an increase in bad debt.
 
Liquidity and Financial Condition
 
BellSouth's cash generation and financial position enable it to reinvest in its business while distributing substantial cash to its shareholders. BellSouth's priorities for the use of cash are to fund investment opportunities, maintain a capital structure that balances a low weighted-average cost of capital against an appropriate level of financial flexibility, and distribute cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
 
Sources and uses of cash
 
Our primary source of cash flow is dividends from our consolidated operating subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries generate sufficient cash flow to fund their capital expenditures. Generally, we do not permit these subsidiaries to accumulate cash, but require them to distribute cash to us in the form of dividends. Our subsidiaries no longer issue external debt, and they redeem existing debt as it matures. Any subsidiary financing needs are provided by BellSouth, either through available cash or through external financing. In addition, after funding capital expenditures and redeeming maturing debt, Cingular Wireless distributes 40 percent of its remaining cash, reflecting our ownership percentage, to BellSouth.
 
Our sources of funds  primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from readily available external financing arrangements  are sufficient to meet all current obligations on a timely basis. We believe that these sources of funds will
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
be sufficient to meet the operating needs of our business for at least the next twelve months. Information about the Company's cash flows, by category, is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
Net cash provided by (used for):
 
Cash generated by operations declined $258 in the first half of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher incremental cash expenses associated with network restoration from hurricane damage sustained in late 2005 and severance payments under the 2006 workforce reduction. Partially offsetting this negative impact was higher operating income (absent hurricane-related expense) and positive changes in working capital.
 
Operating cash flows in the second half of 2006 will be negatively impacted by higher federal income tax payments.
 
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
 
Capital expenditures consist primarily of (a) gross additions to property, plant and equipment having an estimated service life of one year or more, plus incidental costs of preparing the asset for its intended use, and (b) gross additions to capitalized software. Our capital expenditures of $2,031 during the first half of 2006 and of $1,579 during the first half of 2005 were incurred to support our wireline network, to promote the introduction of new products and services and to increase operating efficiency and productivity. The increase in capital expenditures compared to the prior period relates primarily to increased spending for broadband investments in infrastructure and systems and expenditures of approximately $265 for Hurricane Katrina restoration efforts in the first half of 2006.
 
WIRELESS
 
In general, Cingular Wireless funds its capital and operating cash requirements from operations. To the extent additional funding is required, BellSouth and AT&T provide unsubordinated short-term financing on a pro rata basis. As of June 30, 2006, BellSouth had outstanding advances under the line of credit of $681. During 2006, we expect Cingular Wireless to utilize its operating cash flow after capital expenditures primarily to pay its maturing third-party debt.
 
Cingular Wireless made a refundable deposit to the FCC in July 2006 in connection with qualifying for the auction of 90 MHz of spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz frequency bands to begin in August 2006. If they are successful in bidding, their cash requirements may increase potentially impacting BellSouth's pro rata portion of financing.
 
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
 
Dividends
 
Our Board of Directors considers the cash dividend on a quarterly basis. BellSouth has paid a dividend each quarter since it began operations in 1984. Over the last three years, BellSouth increased its quarterly dividend 45 percent from 20 cents per common share to 29 cents per common share. Under the merger agreement with AT&T, without AT&T's prior written consent, BellSouth is not permitted to pay a quarterly dividend in excess of 29 cents per share.
 
Share repurchases
 
BellSouth uses share repurchases to help manage cash distributions to shareholders. In October 2005, BellSouth's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of BellSouth's common shares through 2007. Under this plan, we repurchased nearly $1 billion through December 31, 2005 and approximately $42 during the first half of 2006. Under the merger agreement with AT&T, without AT&T's prior written consent, BellSouth is not permitted to repurchase shares other than those necessary to offset shares issued in connection with employee benefit plans or the direct investment plan. Further, share repurchases may not exceed $500 per fiscal quarter.
 
EXTERNAL FINANCING
 
Credit ratings
 
At June 30, 2006, our long-term debt rating was A2 from Moody's Investor Service and A from Standard and Poor's. Our short-term debt rating at June 30, 2006 was P-1 from Moody's and A-1 from Standard and Poor's. In January 2006,
 
(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts and as Otherwise Indicated)
 
 
Standard and Poor's placed BellSouth's short- and long-term credit ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. Standard and Poor's indicated that its action resulted from its concern over the increasing uncertainty of the business prospects of the local wireline business. BellSouth remains on CreditWatch with negative implications following the March 2006 announcement of the pending merger between BellSouth and AT&T. On July 27, 2006, Moody's confirmed the A2 senior unsecured and P-1 short-term ratings of BellSouth.
 
Financing arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2006, our authorized commercial paper program was $10.5 billion, with $2.0 billion outstanding. We believe that we have ready access to the commercial paper market in the event we need funding in excess of our operating cash flows. We also have an effective registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we could issue $3.1 billion of long-term debt securities. The merger agreement with AT&T provides that we cannot incur additional indebtedness in excess of $1.5 billion in the aggregate without AT&T's prior written consent.
 
BellSouth and BellSouth Telecommunications currently have debt outstanding under various indentures that we have entered into over the past thirteen years. None of these indentures contain any financial covenants. They do contain limitations that restrict the Company's (or the affiliate of the company that is a party to the indenture) ability to create liens on their properties or assets (but not the properties or assets of their subsidiaries) except in specified circumstances. None of these indentures contains any provisions that are tied to the ratings assigned to the Company or its affiliates by an external debt rating agency. Further, none of these indentures contains cross-default provisions.
 
Effective April 29, 2005, we entered into a syndicated line of credit in the amount of $3.0 billion. This line of credit serves as a backup facility for our commercial paper program and will expire on April 29, 2008. We do not have any balances outstanding under the line of credit.
 
Except as described in this paragraph, the line of credit contains no financial covenants or requirements for compensating balances. Further, the line of credit does not contain any provisions that are tied to the ratings assigned to us or our affiliates by an external debt rating agency. The line of credit limits the debt of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to 300 percent of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the preceding four quarters. During the first half of 2006, this debt to earnings ratio was approximately 215 percent. In addition, the line of credit prohibits the Company and its significant subsidiaries from permitting liens to be placed on their properties or assets except in specified circumstances. If BellSouth or any of our subsidiaries defaults on any outstanding debt in excess of $200, an event of default will occur under the line of credit.
 
Market Risk
 
For a complete discussion of our market risks, you should refer to the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. Our primary exposure to market risks relates to unfavorable movements in interest rates and changes in equity investment prices. We do not anticipate any significant changes in our objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures.
 
In order to limit our risk from fluctuations in interest rates, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
 
Other than repayments of debt as discussed in the Liquidity and Financial Condition Section, there are no material changes with respect to off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as presented in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
In most of our sale and divestiture transactions we indemnify the purchaser for various items including labor and general litigation as well as certain tax matters. Generally, the terms last one to five years for general and specific indemnities and for the statutory review periods for tax matters. The events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the indemnity are transaction and circumstance specific. We regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued for expected losses that are probable. In addition, in the normal course of business, we indemnify counter parties in certain agreements. The nature and terms of these indemnities vary by transaction. Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of indemnities.
 
We do not have transactions, arrangements or relationships with "special purpose" entities, and we do not have any off-balance sheet debt.
 
 
 
Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk
 
See the caption labeled "Market Risk" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. We also have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
 
The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls can prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and, while our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b). Based upon the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer along with the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at providing reasonable assurance that all material information relating to BellSouth (including consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our Exchange Act reports is reported in a timely manner. In addition, based on such evaluation we have identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
 
Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
 
In addition to historical information, this document contains forward-looking statements regarding business prospects, financial trends and accounting policies that may affect our future operating results, financial position and cash flows. From time to time, we also may provide oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as "will," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," "forecast" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, they include statements relating to future actions, prospective products and services, future performance or results of current and anticipated products and services, sales efforts, capital expenditures, expenses, interest rates, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.
 
These statements are based on our assumptions and estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties. For these statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
 
There are possible developments that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forecast or implied in the forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements, which are current only as of the date of this filing. We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
 
While the below list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive, some factors, in addition to those contained throughout this document, that could affect future operating results, financial position and cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION
 
For a description of material developments relating to certain pending legal proceedings, see Note M to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Item 1A. Risk Factors
 
In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and the factor set forth below, all of which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. These described risks are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
 
The pending merger with AT&T may create uncertainty for our customers, employees and suppliers.
 
On March 5, 2006, we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement with AT&T. Completion of the merger requires certain regulatory approvals. The merger is currently expected to close in the fall of 2006. Current employees may experience uncertainty about their post-merger roles with AT&T. This may materially adversely affect the ability of BellSouth to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing, technical and other personnel. In addition, key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with AT&T following the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees to the same extent as we have in the past. Further, diversion of attention from ongoing operations on the part of management and employees could adversely affect our customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we have relationships. While the merger is pending, customers and strategic partners may delay or defer decisions to use BellSouth services, which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings, as well as the market price of our common shares.
 
In addition, customers may experience uncertainty about their BellSouth services, including network integration, pricing, and customer service, after the closing of the merger. This may materially adversely affect the ability of BellSouth to gain new customers and retain existing customers.

PART I  FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
(Dollars in Millions)
Cingular Wireless LLC (the Company) is a Delaware limited liability company formed in 2000 by SBC Communications Inc. (SBC)* and BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) as the operating company for their U.S. wireless joint venture. AT&T and BellSouth, through their wholly-owned subsidiaries, respectively, own approximate 60% and 40% economic interests in the Company. Cingular Wireless Corporation (the Manager), which is directed equally by AT&T and BellSouth, acts as the Company's manager and controls the Company's management and operations. The Company provides wireless voice and data communications services, including local, long-distance and roaming services using both cellular and personal communications services (PCS) frequencies licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and equipment to customers in 46 states, including service to all 100 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas. All of the Company's operations, which primarily serve customers in the U.S., are conducted through subsidiaries or joint ventures. Through roaming arrangements with other carriers, the Company provides its customers service in regions where it does not have network coverage and is thus able to serve customers in virtually the entire U.S. and over 180 foreign countries.
In October 2004, the Company acquired AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (AT&T Wireless) for aggregate consideration of approximately $41,000 in cash. AT&T Wireless, which has been renamed New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc., will continue to be referred to herein as AT&T Wireless and is now a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The operations of AT&T Wireless are integrated with those of the Company, and the business is conducted under the "Cingular" brand name.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Management believes the consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods shown. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and accompanying notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form  for the year ended December 31, 2005 and its Quarterly Report on Form  for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.

* On November 18, 2005, SBC acquired AT&T Corp. and changed the name of the surviving entity to AT&T Inc. When used herein, "AT&T" will refer to the surviving entity and, prior to November 18, 2005, to SBC. AT&T Corp. refers to that entity prior to November 18, 2005. In March 2006, AT&T and BellSouth agreed to merge. The transaction has been approved by the Board of Directors and shareholders of each company. It is subject to review by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other regulatory authorities and satisfaction of other conditions.

subsidiaries, as well as for certain states which impose income taxes upon non-corporate legal entities. After the acquisition, AT&T Wireless contributed the majority of its assets and liabilities to Cingular Wireless II, LLC (CW II), which it owns jointly with Cingular Wireless LLC. In exchange for the assets and liabilities contributed to CW II, AT&T Wireless received a 43% ownership interest in CW II, from which any income (loss) is allocated and is subject to federal and state income taxes. The remaining income (loss) from CW II is allocated to the Company and flows through to the members who are taxed at their level pursuant to federal and state income tax laws.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory rates. The Company provides valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.
The Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 was 20.88% and 22.97%, respectively. This rate varies from the expected federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of the exclusion from the Company's income tax provision of operating results which are wholly allocated to its respective members' federal income tax returns. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 also includes provisions for income taxes in certain state and local jurisdictions.
The Company incurred income tax expense in the six months ended June 30, 2005 despite a pre-tax loss as a result of the exclusion from the Company's income tax provision of operating losses which were wholly allocated to its respective members' federal income tax returns. Income was generated at certain taxable subsidiaries during the six months ended June 30, 2005. The income tax provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, also includes income tax expense related to state income tax law changes and the release of valuation allowances.
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-3, (EITF  The scope of EITF  includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions and some excise taxes. The Task Force affirmed its conclusion that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross or a net basis, based on their accounting policy, which should be disclosed pursuant to APB Opinion No. 22, If such taxes are significant, and are presented on a gross basis, the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed. The consensus on EITF  will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company currently records gross receipts taxes, USF contributions and miscellaneous other taxes and regulatory cost recovery fees on a gross basis in its consolidated statements of operations.

In November 2000, the Company and Crowley Digital Wireless, LLC (Crowley Digital) entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Salmon PCS LLC (Salmon) was formed to bid as a "very small business" for certain 1900 megahertz (MHz) band PCS licenses auctioned by the FCC. The Company granted Crowley Digital the right to put its approximate 20% economic interest in Salmon to the Company at a cash price equal to Crowley Digital's initial investment plus a specified rate of return. The Company's maximum liability for the purchase of Crowley Digital's interest in Salmon under this put right is $225. The fair values of this put obligation, estimated at $172 and $181 as of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2006, respectively, are included in "Accrued liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets for the respective periods. Crowley Digital has exercised its put right pursuant to which the Company expects to pay approximately $186 should the put be approved by the FCC and close in October 2006, as the Company anticipates.

course operations. The revolving credit agreement provides that in the event that the Company has available cash (as defined) on any business day, such amount shall first be applied to the repayment of the revolving loans, and any remaining excess shall then be applied to the repayment of the Subordinated Notes (member loans) from AT&T and BellSouth at month end if the Company does not then require a cash advance under the agreement. As of December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2006, the Company had an outstanding balance of $511 and $1,703, respectively, under the revolving credit agreement.
The Company repaid $1,000 of 7.35% AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. unsecured and unsubordinated Senior Notes when they matured on March 1, 2006.
These consolidated financial statements include charges from AT&T and BellSouth for certain expenses pursuant to various agreements.

The Company had receivables from affiliates of $156 and $175 and payables to affiliates of $210 and $261 at December 31, 2005 and June 30, 2006, respectively.
In 2005, management of the Company approved plans affecting the integration of retail stores, administrative space and network acquired in the merger with AT&T Wireless in October 2004 with those of legacy Cingular. These plans resulted in adjustments in 2005 to the original purchase price allocation for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of AT&T Wireless and the need to shorten the useful lives of certain network and other property, plant and equipment.
The incremental depreciation expense related to the shortened useful lives was $105 and $140 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively, and $43 and $133 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006.

The Company has unconditional purchase commitments for advertising and marketing, computer equipment and services, roaming, long distance services, network equipment and related maintenance and software development and related maintenance. These commitments totaled approximately $1,272 at June 30, 2006. Included in this amount are commitments aggregating $121 to AT&T, BellSouth and their affiliates for telecommunications and other services.
In connection with the termination of the Company's GSMF network infrastructure joint venture with the Company made a $1,200 commitment to purchase a minimum number of minutes from over a four-year transition period. This commitment became effective in January 2005, and approximately $310 of the purchase commitment remained outstanding as of June 30, 2006. The Company believes that the rates reflected in this purchase commitment are indicative of market rates based upon the volume of the commitment and the length of the transition period.

The Company is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business involving allegations of personal injury, breach of contract, anti-competitive conduct, employment law issues, regulatory matters and other actions. To the extent that management believes that a loss arising from litigation or regulatory proceedings is probable and can reasonably be estimated, an amount is accrued on the financial statements for the estimated loss. As additional information becomes available, the potential liability related to the matter is reassessed and the accruals are revised, if necessary. While complete assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of any legal claims, the Company believes that any financial impact would not be material to its business, financial position or cash flows.

Overview of Business
We earn revenues and generate cash primarily by offering a comprehensive variety of high-quality wireless voice and data communications services and products. Our services are available in a variety of postpaid pricing plans and prepaid service arrangements. Our voice and data offerings are tailored to meet the communications needs of targeted customer segments, including youth, family, active professionals, local and regional businesses and national corporate accounts.
At June 30, 2006, we served 57.3 million voice and data subscribers over our cellular and PCS networks and were the largest provider of wireless voice and data communications services in the U.S., based on the number of wireless subscribers. We had access to FCC licenses to provide cellular or PCS wireless communications services covering 296 million POPs, or approximately 99% of the U.S. population, including all of the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan markets.
Industry and Operating Trends
We compete for customers based principally on our reputation, network quality, customer service, price and service offerings. We face substantial and increasing competition in all aspects of our business. Our competitors are principally three national (Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel and and a large number of regional providers of cellular, PCS and other wireless communications services, as well as resellers. In addition, we may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other current or future communications technologies and services. Competition and the high rate of wireless service penetration may continue to adversely impact gross additions, revenue growth, expenses and margins.

We acquired AT&T Wireless in October 2004 and are continuing the process of integrating its assets and operations, primarily the network, retail stores and information technology functions. In connection therewith, we expect to continue to incur significant costs through the end of 2006 associated with such integration activities. We expect to substantially complete activities associated with our network integration plans by December 31, 2006. We continue to realize cost savings and improvements in the operating performance of our combined operations. We expect these savings to increasingly offset integration costs and contribute to higher operating margins during the second half of 2006.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, our operating income was negatively impacted by $163 and $397, respectively, of integration costs, which were primarily reflected in our consolidated statements of operations within "Depreciation and amortization" expenses, "Cost of services" and "Selling, general and administrative" expenses. Integration costs impacting "Depreciation and amortization" expenses primarily included accelerated depreciation of $77 and $247 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively. In addition, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, integration costs impacting "Cost of services" of $67 and $85, respectively, and "Selling, general and administrative" of $19 and $65 respectively, were primarily comprised of network system costs and IT development. Lastly, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, our operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $336 and $695, respectively, of non-cash amortization expenses related to amortizable intangible assets that were recorded with the acquisition.

OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA margin is calculated as OIBDA divided by service revenues. These are non-GAAP financial measures. They differ from operating income and operating margin, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that they exclude depreciation and amortization. They differ from net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that they exclude, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations: (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities, (iv) equity in net income of affiliates, (v) other, net, and (vi) provision for income taxes. We believe these measures are relevant and useful information to our investors as they are an integral part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that our management uses to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated operations. They are used by management as a measurement of our success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect our ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing our performance with that of many of our competitors. The components of OIBDA include the key revenue and expense items for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance. Lastly, we use this measure for planning purposes and in presentations to our board of directors, and we use multiples of this current or projected measure in our discounted cash flow models to determine the value of our licensing costs and our overall enterprise valuation.
OIBDA Discussion.
OIBDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. OIBDA excludes other, net, minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities and equity in net income of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of our subscriber base and our national footprint that we utilize to obtain and service our customers. Equity in net income of affiliates represents our proportionate share of the net income of affiliates in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control. As we do not control these entities, our management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of our primary operations. OIBDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with our capitalization and tax structures. Finally, OIBDA excludes depreciation and amortization, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments.
We believe OIBDA as a percentage of service revenues to be a more relevant measure of our operating margin than OIBDA as a percentage of total revenue. We generally subsidize a portion of our handset sales, all of which are recognized in the period in which we sell the handset. This results in a disproportionate impact on our margin in that period. Management views this equipment subsidy as a cost to acquire or retain a subscriber, which is recovered through the ongoing service revenue that is generated

by the customer. We also use service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with our competitors, as they calculate their margins using services revenue as well.
There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. OIBDA and OIBDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income of affiliates, that directly affect our net income. Management compensates for these limitations by carefully analyzing how our competitors present performance measures that are similar in nature to OIBDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. OIBDA and OIBDA margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
ARPU is defined as cellular/ PCS service revenues during the period divided by average cellular/ PCS subscribers during the period. This metric is used to compare the recurring revenue amounts generated on our cellular/ PCS network to prior periods and internal targets. Our ARPU calculation excludes data revenues from customers retained in the sale of our Mobitex business in late 2004 and thereby makes our metric more comparable with other wireless carriers, which we believe makes it more useful to investors.

Consolidated Results of Operations
 
NM  Not Meaningful
We had 57.3 million cellular/ PCS subscribers at June 30, 2006. We added approximately 1.5 million and 3.2 million subscribers, net of disconnections, to our subscriber base during the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, up from 1.0 million and 2.3 million additions in the respective corresponding prior year periods. Gross subscriber additions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 totaled approximately 4.4 million and 9.2 million, respectively. The slight increase in total gross subscriber additions was primarily driven by new prepaid offerings launched in the second half of 2005 and strong reseller additions, partially offset by decreased postpaid additions due to planned distribution rationalization such as the reduction of retail stores and agents.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, our monthly cellular/ PCS churn rate was 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, down from 2.2% in both corresponding prior year periods. Postpaid churn for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 was 1.5%, down from 1.8% and 1.9% in the corresponding prior year periods. The decline in our cellular/ PCS churn was driven by a 12.7% and 10.1% reduction in disconnections for the three and six month periods, which we believe is attributed primarily to better network quality and coverage.

,more advanced features than those in the past. The components of the change in service revenue are described as follows:
Service revenue increased $576 and $1,162 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to the increases in local service voice and data revenues, partially offset by decreases to roamer and other revenues. The local service-voice component of total service revenues includes recurring monthly access charges, airtime usage, including prepaid service, and charges for optional features and services, such as voice mail, -mobile calling, roadside assistance, caller ID and handset insurance. Local service-voice revenues also include billings to our customers for the USF and other regulatory fees and taxes.
Service revenue.
mobile-to
The key driver of the increase in local service-voice revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 was an increase of 11.3% and 10.9% in the average number of cellular/ PCS subscribers for the three and six months, respectively, over the corresponding prior year periods. Data revenues, increased $335, or 51.2% and $638, or 52.1%, to $989 and $1,862 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. This increase was driven by greater data service penetration and usage of SMS messaging and other data services by our cellular/ PCS subscribers.
Incollect roaming revenues decreased when compared with the amounts from the corresponding prior year period and continue to be unfavorably impacted by the bundling of "free" roaming minutes with all-inclusive regional and national rate plans.
Long distance revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2006 increased $23 from the corresponding prior year period due primarily to an increase in international long distance revenues. Long distance revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2006 increased $35 from the corresponding prior year period due to increases in both international and domestic long distance revenues.
These sales are comprised of product, accessory and upgrade revenues. Equipment sales increased $33 and $198 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, from the corresponding prior year periods. This increase is primarily driven by higher priced handsets despite lower postpaid gross additions and related equipment volumes, compared to the corresponding prior year periods. Upgrade revenue increased as a result of higher volume as well as higher priced devices, when compared to the corresponding prior year periods.
Equipment Sales.
Total cost of services, excluding depreciation, increased $204 and $380 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The increase resulted from increases in local systems cost of $142 and $230 and third-party network system cost components of $62 and $150 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods.
Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation).
The increase in the local systems costs component of cost of services resulted primarily from increases in interconnection fees of $65 and $170 associated with a 19.2% and 20.9% growth in system minutes of use; an increase in local network system costs of $80 and $120, primarily related to lease termination buyouts and network rationalization costs and integration costs; and USF and gross receipts tax increases of $43 and $6, each for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year period. These increases were offset by decreases of $43 and $64 for reseller services expenses. The reseller services expense decreases primarily resulted from the 49% and 46%

respective decreases in minutes of use related to the purchase commitment, which were partially offset by higher handset insurance claims for both prior year comparative periods.
T-Mobile
The third-party network system costs component of cost of services includes incollect roaming and long distance costs. Roaming costs increased $17 and $65 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods, and long distance costs increased $45 and $85 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. Increases in long distance costs were driven by higher minutes of use resulting from the increased number of average subscribers offset by rate decreases. Roaming costs increased due to increased volumes and prices over the comparable prior periods.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, the $119 and $151 respective increases in cost of equipment sales resulted from the net product cost increases of $39 and $66, accessory cost increases of $11 and $11 and increases in the per unit cost for upgrade equipment which primarily contributed to the overall upgrade increases of $69 and $74, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods.
Cost of equipment sales.
The net increases in product costs resulted primarily from a 1.7% and 7.4% increase in the average cost per unit sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The net increases in upgrade equipment costs resulted primarily from a 4.8% and 13.0% increase in the average cost per unit sold for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods. These cost increases were driven by higher-end handsets despite a lower volume of postpaid gross additions as compared to the corresponding prior years.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 decreased $196 and $351, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. For the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2006, SG&A included integration costs of $76 and $19, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2006, SG&A included integration costs of $178 and $65, respectively. For the 2005 periods, the integration costs primarily related to employee termination benefits for former Cingular employees, systems integration costs, sales distribution rationalization and administrative real estate consolidation. For the 2006 periods, the integration costs primarily related to systems integration costs, and to a lesser extent, administrative real estate consolidation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Selling expenses, which include sales, marketing, advertising and commission expenses, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 decreased $57 and $89, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods, primarily attributable to advertising decreases of $25 and $48, respectively, as well as net decreases in commissions of $30 and $43, respectively. The decreases in print and radio advertising were partially offset by increases in television advertising. The decreases in commissions for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, compared to the corresponding prior year periods, are primarily the result of decreases in indirect commissions which were largely attributable to reductions in the average cost per activation and reduced agent branding expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the decrease in indirect commissions was offset by net increases in direct commissions resulting from changes in the compensation plan.
Costs for maintaining and supporting our subscriber base for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 decreased $109 and $182, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. This decrease was partly due to decreases in bad debt expense of $72 and $117, respectively, primarily resulting from improved collections, which resulted in lower net account write-offs. Additionally contributing to the decrease in the costs for maintaining and supporting our subscriber base were decreases

in customer service costs of $41 and $87, respectively, due to reduced outsourced professional services at certain call centers. The decreases in bad debt expense and customer service costs were partially offset by increased prepaid card replenishment costs in the three and six months ended June 30, 2006.
Other administrative costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 decreased $30 and $80, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The decreases in the three and six month periods primarily resulted from headcount reductions and a federal excise tax refund accrued in the second quarter of 2006 pursuant to guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service .
Depreciation and amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 was essentially flat with the corresponding prior year periods. Increases in depreciation of $89 and $235 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods are largely attributable to increased network investment and reductions to depreciation expense recorded in 2005 associated with the revaluation of acquired AT&T Wireless assets pursuant to the network rationalization plans substantially offset by the impact of assets being fully depreciated in 2006. Intangibles amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 were $339 and $704, respectively, representing decreases of $120 and $261, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to declining amortization of the customer relationship intangible assets recorded with the AT&T Wireless acquisition. The decreases also resulted from other intangible assets that became fully amortized in 2005.
Depreciation and amortization.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, interest expense totaled $298 and $595, respectively, and represented decreases of $28 and $69, respectively, when compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The decreases mainly resulted from the repayment of $2,911 of member loans during 2005 and the repayment of $1,000 of 7.35% AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. unsecured and unsubordinated Senior Notes when they matured on March 1, 2006.
Interest Expense.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities totaled $43 and $84, respectively, and represented increases of $2 and $27, respectively, over the corresponding prior year periods. The increases primarily resulted from increased partnership net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2006.
Minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, other, net decreased $27 and $38, respectively, over the corresponding prior year periods. The decreases resulted from higher interest income earned in the three and six months ended June 30, 2005, primarily attributable to cash proceeds received from the sale of certain network assets to in January 2005. Additionally, a gain on the sale of certain assets of $13 was recognized in the three months ended June 30, 2005. No comparable activity occurred in 2006.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, the provision for income taxes was $142 and $266, representing increases of $118 and $220, respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior year periods. The higher provision for income taxes resulted from higher taxable income versus the prior year periods.
Provision for income taxes.
Our effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 was 20.88% and 22.97%, respectively. These rates vary from the expected federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of the exclusion from our income tax provision of operating results that are wholly allocated to our respective

For the six months ended June 30, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $2,485, a decrease of $1,489 from the six months ended June 30, 2005. Although we experienced a $1,180 increase in operating income, excluding depreciation and amortization, this was offset by decreases of cash generated from working capital. This working capital decrease, as compared with prior year activity for the comparable period, was primarily attributable to the following increases in uses of cash associated with accounts payable and other current liabilities ($2,261); other current assets ($285); inventories ($122); and accounts receivable ($23). The decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2006 primarily resulted from the payment of capital expenditures obligations generated at the end of 2005.
Net cash provided by operating activities.
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net cash used in investing activities was $2,917, an increase of $1,113 from the corresponding prior year period. The increase was primarily the result of decreased cash receipts from dispositions. The six months ended June 30, 2005 included proceeds from certain one-time transactions that were not present in the six months ending June 30, 2006. These one-time transactions included$2,482 of proceeds from the sale of our California and Nevada network assets to in January 2005; the $262 of proceeds from the sale of wireless properties, including those that we were required to divest; and the $180 from the sale of spectrum to

credit agreement. This increase in cash was offset by our $1,000 repayment of the 7.35% AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. unsecured and unsubordinated Senior Notes. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the primary use of cash was the $1,667 of repayments to our members under our revolving credit agreement, $301 of repayments to our members under our Subordinated Notes and $250 in repayments of AT&T Wireless Senior Notes.
Under a revolving credit agreement, AT&T and BellSouth provide unsubordinated short-term financing on a pro rata basis at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.05% for our ordinary course operations based upon our budget and forecasted cash needs. The revolving credit agreement provides that in the event that we have available cash (as defined) on any business day, such amount shall first be applied to the repayment of the revolving loans, and any remaining excess then shall be applied to the repayment of the subordinated member loans from AT&T and BellSouth at month end if we do not then require a cash advance under the agreement. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, we made net draws of $27 and $1,192, respectively. In addition, at June 30, 2006, we had $1,703 outstanding under the revolving credit agreement.
As of June 30, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $189. We expect to fund our remaining capital requirements for at least the next 12 months by using existing cash balances, cash generated from operations and, if necessary, draws under our revolving credit agreement with AT&T and BellSouth.
Our operating cash requirements during 2006 will be driven primarily by capital expenditures associated with our network enhancement and integration activities, interest payments and costs associated with acquiring and retaining new and existing subscribers. During 2006, we expect to make tax distributions to our members in amounts sufficient to permit members to pay the tax liabilities resulting from allocations of income tax items from us.
The upgrade, integration and expansion of our GSM/ GPRS/ EDGE networks, the continued installation of UMTS/ HSDPA technology in a number of markets and the construction and upgrade of network facilities in California and Nevada following the sale of facilities to upon the termination of our GSMF network infrastructure joint venture will require substantial amounts of capital over the next several quarters. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, we spent $1,582 and $3,023 for network and non-network capital expenditures. We expect our capital expenditures in 2006 to be in the $7,000 to $7,500 range.

We made a $500 refundable deposit to the FCC in July 2006 in connection with qualifying for the auction of 90 MHz of spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz frequency bands to begin in August 2006. Our cash requirements may increase if we are successful in our bidding.
Spectrum Auction.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, respectively, aside from integration activities impacting depreciation and amortization, we incurred $86 and $150 of integration costs, which are included primarily in "Selling, general and administrative" expenses and "Cost of services" expenses in our consolidated income statements. The remaining integration costs expected to be incurred primarily relate to lease related termination and equipment removal costs. We expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with integration activities through 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have not been any material changes in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates from those reported in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in our Annual Report on Form  for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The majority of our financial instruments are medium- and long-term fixed rate notes and member loans. Fluctuations in market interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair values of these fixed rate instruments. In addition, we are exposed to market risks, primarily from changes in interest rates. To manage exposure to these fluctuations, manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term, we engage from time to time in hedging transactions that have been authorized by the board of directors of our manager. We do not anticipate any significant changes in our objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures.

As of June 30, 2006, we had outstanding an aggregate of $6,717 in unsecured, subordinated member loans from AT&T and BellSouth with a fixed interest rate of 6.0% and a stated maturity of June 30, 2008.

had $250 of -floating interest rate swaps related to our five-year unsecured senior notes. A change in interest rates of 100 basis points would change our interest expense as a result of the swaps as of June 30, 2006 by approximately $3 per annum. We also have capital leases outstanding of $1,181 with fixed interest rates ranging from 5.72% to 9.6%.

As of June 30, 2006, we had $1,719 of floating rate borrowings. These borrowings primarily include amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement with AT&T and BellSouth, which carry an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.05%. A change in interest rates of 100 basis points would change our interest expense on floating rate debt balances as of June 30, 2006 by approximately $17 per annum.
The risk management discussion above, related to our market risks, contains forward-looking statements and represents, among other things, an estimate of possible changes in fair value that would occur assuming changes in interest rates. Future impacts of market risk would be based on actual developments in the financial markets. See Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements immediately following Part II, Item 6 of this Quarterly Report.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
(a) We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
As of June 30, 2006, management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, completed its evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. We also have investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As we do not control or manage these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.
(b) During the evaluation referred to in Item 4 (a) above, we have identified no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II  OTHER INFORMATION
In a jury trial, Freedom Wireless, Inc. (Freedom) was awarded damages jointly against us and Boston Communications Group, Inc. (BCGI) in the aggregate amount, including prejudgment interest, of approximately $165 million for alleged past infringement of two patents allegedly owned by Freedom and used by BCGI to provide to us and other carriers a prepaid wireless telephone service technology platform. The parties have reached a settlement of this litigation, conditioned on several judicial steps and we will not be required to accrue any additional amount in excess of the $20 million accrued in our consolidated financial statements. We have paid $20 million to an escrow agent.
Several class-action lawsuits have been filed against AT&T Corp. asserting claims under the federal securities laws in connection with the split-off of AT&T Wireless from AT&T Corp. The Separation Agreement between AT&T Wireless and AT&T Corp. provides for the allocation to AT&T Wireless of 70% of any liabilities arising out of these actions. Management's estimation of the potential loss from this and other preacquisition liabilities from AT&T Wireless was previously recorded in the purchase price allocation to AT&T Wireless' assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In March 2006, the plaintiffs and AT&T reached a tentative settlement of this case which would not result in the accrual of any additional liabilities by us. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement and we have paid our $105 million portion of the settlement to an escrow account.
Except as noted above, there are no material changes in the status of our legal proceedings from those described in our Annual Report on Form  for the year ended December 31, 2005.
