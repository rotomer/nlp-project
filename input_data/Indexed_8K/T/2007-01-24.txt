Cingular Wireless Reports Fourth-Quarter 2006 Results
 
ATLANTA  Cingular Wireless, which is now solely owned by AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), today reported net income of $782 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, which is a year-over-year increase of over 283 percent.
FOR RELEASE WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2007
     AT&T's wireless unit also turned in its best quarter ever in net subscriber additions; attained, for the second quarter in a row, year-over-year ARPU growth, including another robust increase in data ARPU; and achieved double-digit growth in service and total revenues.
     "Our last quarter as a joint venture operating under the Cingular name was our best ever on a variety of fronts," said Stan Sigman, the company's president and CEO. "We achieved strong results by delivering on four strategic initiatives  build the best network, offer great products and services, create unmatched distribution, and improve customer service. Backed by the scale, scope, and capabilities of AT&T, we will continue to focus on these initiatives and offer our customers the flexibility and freedom of wireless services."
     In the fourth quarter, the wireless unit reported 2.4 million net customer additions, its highest ever, driven by continued low churn and strong gross customer additions. This compares to 1.8 million in the year-ago quarter and to 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. In the fourth quarter, retail customers accounted for more than 1.6 million of total net adds, a company record.
     ARPU increased by nearly one percent in the fourth quarter, which was the second quarter in a row of year-over-year overall ARPU increase. This was driven by continued strong growth in data ARPU, which increased by 53 percent in the fourth quarter.
     The unit's normalized OIBDA margin* was 34.4 percent, which was an improvement of 340 basis points compared to normalized year-ago results and a sequential decline of 120 points. The sequential decline resulted from seasonally lower roaming revenues and higher marketing and advertising costs, as well as from increased customer acquisition costs associated with the record gross customer additions during the company's busiest selling period.
     Postpaid churn was 1.5 percent, which compares to 1.9 percent in the year-ago quarter and is flat compared to the third quarter of 2006.
     Overall monthly subscriber churn was 1.8 percent, which compares to 2.1 percent in the year-ago quarter and was flat compared to the third quarter of 2006.
     Gross additions for the fourth quarter were a record-tying 5.5 million, which compares to 5.1 million in the year-ago quarter and to 4.6 million in the third quarter of 2006.
     The wireless unit ended the fourth quarter of 2006 with 61.0 million cellular/PCS subscribers, tops among U.S. carriers, and a year-over-year increase of 6.8 million customers. In addition, Cingular's Business Markets Group signed more than 1,000 new and renewed high-end service contracts in the quarter.
     During the fourth quarter of 2006, 99 percent of minutes were carried on Cingular's GSM/UMTS/HSDPA network and 96 percent of the company's subscriber base was GSM/UMTS/HSDPA-equipped.
 
     AT&T's wireless unit operates the nation's largest digital voice and data network. GSM is the world's most widely used wireless technology. Through roaming alliances with other GSM-based providers around the world, Cingular provides the largest global presence of any U.S. wireless carrier, with voice coverage in 190 countries and data roaming in 120.

Reconciliations of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In 2003, to be consistent with industry practices, historical consolidated statements of income for all periods presented were reclassified to reflect billings to our customers for the Universal Service Fund (USF) and other regulatory fees as operating revenues and the costs related to payments into the associated regulatory funds as operating expenses. Similar reclassifications have also been made to 2003 and 2004 historical results for certain gross receipts taxes and other fees which are billed to our customers. Operating income and net income for all periods were unaffected.

EXHIBIT 99.3
OIBDA DISCUSSION
OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA margin is calculated as OIBDA divided by service revenues. These are non-GAAP financial measures. They differ from operating income and operating margin, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that they exclude depreciation and amortization. They differ from net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that they exclude, as presented in AT&T Mobility LLC's (AT&T Mobility), formerly, Cingular Wireless LLC, consolidated statements of operations: (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities, (iv) equity in net income of affiliates, (v) other, net, and (vi) provision for income taxes. We believe these measures are relevant and useful information to our investors as they are an integral part of AT&T Mobility's internal management reporting and planning processes and are important metrics that AT&T Mobility's management uses to evaluate the operating performance of its consolidated operations. They are used by management as a measurement of AT&T Mobility's success in acquiring, retaining and servicing subscribers because we believe these measures reflect AT&T Mobility's ability to generate and grow subscriber revenues while providing a high level of customer service in a cost-effective manner. Management also uses these measures as a method of comparing AT&T Mobility's performance with that of many of its competitors. The components of OIBDA include the key revenue and expense items for which AT&T Mobility's operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance. Lastly, AT&T Mobility uses this measure for planning purposes and in presentations to its Board of Directors, and AT&T Mobility uses multiples of this current or projected measure in its discounted cash flow models to determine the value of its licensing costs and is overall enterprise valuation. OIBDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. OIBDA excludes other, net, minority interest in earnings of consolidated entities and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, as these do not reflect the operating results of AT&T Mobility's subscriber base and its national footprint that AT&T Mobility utilizes to obtain and service its customers. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliates represents AT&T Mobility's proportionate share of the net income (loss) of affiliates in which it exercise significant influence, but do not control. As AT&T Mobility does not control these entities, AT&T Mobility management excludes these results when evaluating the performance of its primary operations. OIBDA also excludes interest expense and the provision for income taxes. Excluding these items eliminates the expenses associated with its capitalization and tax structures. Finally, OIBDA excludes depreciation and amortization, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments. We believe OIBDA as a percentage of service revenues to be a more relevant measure of AT&T Mobility's operating margin than OIBDA as a percentage of total revenue. AT&T Mobility generally subsidizes a portion of its handset sales, all of which are recognized in the period in which AT&T Mobility sells the handset. This results in a disproportionate impact on its margin in that period. Management views this equipment subsidy as a cost to acquire or retain a subscriber, which is recovered through the ongoing service revenue that is generated by the subscriber. AT&T Mobility also uses service revenues to calculate margin to facilitate comparison, both internally and externally with its competitors, as they calculate their margins using services revenue as well. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. OIBDA and OIBDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Furthermore, these performance measures do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, tax expense and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates, that directly affects AT&T Mobility's net income. Management compensates for these limitations by carefully analyzing how AT&T Mobility's competitors present performance measures that are similar in nature to OIBDA as we present it, and considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as
 
well as in connection with its analysis of net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. OIBDA and OIBDA margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.

ARPU is defined as cellular/PCS service revenues during the period divided by average cellular/PCS subscribers during the period. This metric is used to compare the recurring revenue amounts generated on AT&T Mobility's cellular/PCS network to prior periods and internal targets. AT&T Mobility's ARPU calculation excludes data revenues from customers retained in the sale of its Mobitex business in late 2004 and thereby makes its metric more comparable with other wireless carriers, which we believe makes it more useful to investors.
ARPU DISCUSSION
Normalized operating results present AT&T Mobility's GAAP financial results, net of the impact of certain unusual material transactions and special events and circumstances. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2006, AT&T Mobility's normalized results present its GAAP results, net of the impact of three types of normalizing items: 1) tax-effected integration costs resulting from the acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (AT&T Wireless) 2) tax-affected integration costs resulting from the AT&T Inc. acquisition of BellSouth and 3) tax-affected amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded with the AT&T Wireless acquisition. These results are used by management, and we believe investors may find these results useful, as a basis for evaluating the core business performance during the normalized periods against those during comparable periods.
