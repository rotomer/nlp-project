Item 8.01. Other Events.
On June 1, 2007, the registrant AT&T Inc. ("AT&T" or the "Company") provided irrevocable notice to the Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), that the Company will redeem all of its outstanding $500 million principal amount 7.00% Public Income Notes due June 1, 2041, in accordance with the terms of its Indenture dated as of November 1, 1994 with the Trustee. The redemption date will be July 6, 2007.
AT&T intends to fund the redemption of this debt issuance primarily by issuing commercial paper and also with funds from operations. The Company expects the aggregate cash payment to be approximately $503 million, including accrued interest. The Company expects the redemption to result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $13 million to AT&T's third-quarter 2007 financial results, representing the unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs.
