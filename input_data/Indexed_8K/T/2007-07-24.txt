This amended Form 8-K is being furnished to correct a mathematical error in an exhibit for non-GAAP reconciliations that was furnished on the Form 8-K originally submitted on July 24, 2007, announcing the registrant's results of operations for the second quarter of 2007. This error does not change the calculation of OIBDA as a percent of Service Revenues. The corrected reconciliation is attached as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
The following exhibits are furnished as part of this report:

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

 
OIBDA is defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization. OIBDA differs from segment operating income (loss), as calculated in accordance with GAAP, in that it excludes depreciation and amortization. OIBDA does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment, or other discretionary uses. OIBDA is not presented as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of OIBDA, as presented, may differ from similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
