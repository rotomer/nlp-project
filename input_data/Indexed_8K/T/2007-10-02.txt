As provisions of the arrangement are enacted, AT&T expects to incur charges of approximately $80 million over the next 12 months related to the arrangement.
 
Subject to completion of certain international regulatory approvals and works council consultations, the global telecommunication and networking services outsourcing agreement provides for AT&T to transition employment of associated IBM employees in over 30 countries.
