On October 15, 2007, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of AT&T Inc. approved an amendment to the Long Term Compensation Plan of AT&T Mobility LLC (formerly known as Cingular Wireless) effective as of November 1, 2007. AT&T Mobility used a combination of performance units, performance stock units and restricted stock units as its long term compensation vehicle before it became wholly-owned by AT&T Inc. in December 2006. If the recipient terminated employment, the AT&T Mobility awards would be forfeited unless the employee left because of death or disability, or was retirement eligible, in which case the employee would receive a pro-rata payout, subject to the achievement of the relevant performance standards in the case of performance based awards.
 
AT&T Inc. uses performance shares as its long term compensation component. Upon termination of employment, the performance shares are paid out, subject to satisfaction of the performance objectives, on a pro-rata basis unless the employee was retirement eligible at termination, in which case the performance share awards are not reduced. At death or termination of employment due to disability, the employee (or estate) would receive a 100% payout. The Committee modified the AT&T Mobility plan so that the treatment of long term compensation under that plan would be more comparable to long term compensation at AT&T Inc.
 
As a result of the amendment, (i) if a participant retires, then performance units, performance stock units and restricted stock units (collectively, Awards) granted under the AT&T Mobility plan are paid out (subject to attainment of applicable performance goals, if applicable) on the normal payment date on the same terms as if the participant were still employed on such date, (ii) if a participant terminates due to death or disability, the Awards are paid out in full in the year following termination as if the applicable performance goals were met at a level of 100%, (iii) if a participant is terminated for cause, the Awards are forfeited, and (iv) if a participant terminates other than for cause, death, disability or retirement, the participant receives a pro-rated payout (subject to attainment of applicable performance goals, if applicable) based on the number of months during which the participant was employed during the performance period.
 
In addition, in determining whether an employee was eligible for retirement under the AT&T Mobility plan, AT&T Mobility only gave credit for service with AT&T Mobility, except with respect to certain employees who transferred to AT&T Mobility at the time of its formation. The amendment incorporates the service requirements used by AT&T Inc. in its 2006 Incentive Plan, which gives credit for service with all AT&T entities.
 
Of the named executive officers identified in AT&T's proxy statement for its 2007 annual meeting of stockholders, Mr. Sigman participates in the AT&T Mobility Plan. The plan and the amounts payable to Mr. Sigman thereunder are described in the 2007 proxy statement, which description is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing
 
 
description of the amendment to the plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amendment, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

AMENDMENTS TO THE
CINGULAR WIRELESS LONG TERM COMPENSATION PLAN
(As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2005)
 
 
 
"Retirement" means the termination of employment for reasons other than Death or Disability, on or after the date on which (1) the Participant is first eligible, upon Termination of Employment, for retiree health coverage in accordance with the terms of the Company's health plan (or the health plans of SBC Communications Inc. ("SBC") or BellSouth Corporation ("BellSouth") with respect to certain Participants who transferred from BellSouth and SBC to Cingular Wireless LLC ("Cingular") as part of the formation of Cingular and met certain age and service requirements at the time of their contribution to Cingular and whose retiree health coverage will be provided by either BellSouth or SBC) all as determined by the Company's health plan and the administrator of such plan, in its sole discretion, (2) a Participant (who is also a participant in the AT&T 2006 Incentive Plan) is considered by AT&T Inc. to be eligible for "Retirement," for purposes of the AT&T 2006 Incentive Plan or (3) the Participant is eligible to retire under any other guidelines established by the Administrator.
 
 
"AT&T" means AT&T Inc.
 
"Cause" means willful and gross misconduct on the part of a Participant that is materially and demonstrably detrimental to the Company (or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company) as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.
 
"Termination of Employment" means the event where the Participant is no longer an employee of the Company or of any Subsidiary or member of the Company's controlled group of corporations or entities as determined by the Code (is this a defined term in their Plan?)."
 
 
"Awards payable to Participants who incur a Termination of Employment on or after November 1, 2007, shall be governed the provisions of Appendix A to the Plan."
 
 
 
 
 
"The Administrator also reserves the discretion to reduce or eliminate the amount of Dividend Equivalent Payments payable to a Participant following the Participant's Termination of Employment."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appendix A
 
Terminations of Employment on or
After November 1, 2007
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6.1(e) and 6.3(d) of the Plan requiring a Participant to be actively employed on the last day of the Plan Year of any Performance Period and on the date of payment of any Award as a condition precedent to the payment of an Award (and the provisions related to payments in the event of Death, Disability and Retirement), Participants who do not meet these requirements due to a Termination of Employment on or after November 1, 2007, shall be eligible to receive the following payments for a Performance Period:
 
 
1
Payment, if any, will be at the regular time for payment (
i.e
., following the completion of the Performance Period and certification by the Administrator of the Performance Goals and level of payment), and the Award payment will be based upon the Company's actual results with respect to the Performance Goals and other conditions as set forth in the Plan and as determined by the Administrator. Also, within its sole discretion and without limitation, the Administrator may reduce or eliminate the Award before the payout of the Award, but only to the extent such Award would not have been payable but for this amendment.
 
Except as herein modified, the remaining provisions of Section 6.1(e) and 6.3(d) of the Plan, as applicable, shall remain in full force and effect.
