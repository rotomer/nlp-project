Item 8.01  Other Events.
Dallas, Dec. 4, 2008  AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) today announced a planned reduction of approximately 12,000 jobs, or about 4 percent of the companys total workforce, citing economic pressures, a changing business mix and a more streamlined organizational structure.
In response to these business and economic factors, AT&T plans to reduce its 2009 capital expenditures from 2008 levels. Capital plans for 2009 are being finalized now and specific guidance will be provided when the company releases its fourth quarter results in late January.
Associated with these job reductions which will occur in December and throughout 2009, AT&T will take a charge of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 to pay severance to affected employees.
While AT&T is reducing jobs in some areas, it continues to add jobs in other parts of the business  such as wireless, video and broadband  to meet customer demand.
Many nonmanagement employees affected by these reductions have a guaranteed job offer under union contracts.  All employees will receive severance in accordance with management policies or union agreements.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
