CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Information set forth in this filing contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&Ts filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this filing based on new information or otherwise.
We announced on April 22, 2009 that first-quarter 2009 reported earnings were $0.53 per diluted share compared with $0.57 per share for the first quarter of 2008. First-quarter 2009 reported net income was $3.1 billion compared with $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2008.
First quarter results reflected continued wireless subscriber gains and growth in wireline IP and wireless data services.  Growth in these areas were offset by continuing declines in wireline voice access lines and business voice revenues.
First-quarter 2009 revenues were $30.6 billion compared with $30.7 billion in first-quarter 2008 and first-quarter 2009 operating expenses were $24.8 billion compared with $24.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter 2009 reported operating income margin was 18.8%, down from 19.5% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting lower revenue growth, costs associated with the iPhone 3G and noncash pension and retiree benefit expenses of more than $400 million.  First-quarter operating income was $5.7 billion versus $6.0 billion.
AT&T Mobilitys reported revenues for the first-quarter 2009 were $12.9 billion up from $11.8 billion the year-ago quarter. The increase in revenues reflected an increase in net customers and continued strong growth in data revenues.  AT&T Mobility recorded a net gain of 1.2 million wireless customers in the first quarter of 2009, including 875,000 postpaid subscribers, bringing AT&T Mobility's customer base at quarter-end to 78.2  million up 6.9 million compared with first-quarter 2008.  Average revenue per postpaid subscriber increased 2.1 percent versus the year-earlier first quarter due to strong growth in data services.  First-quarter 2009 reported operating expenses totaled $9.5 billion, up 7.3 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008, reflecting costs associated with the iPhone 3G, including customer acquisition costs.
Revenues from our wireline business customers were $10.7 billion versus $11.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, reflecting continuing economic pressures on both retail and wholesale customers, primarily in voice products and CPE. Revenues from wireline consumer customers were $5.4 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, as a decline in voice revenues more than offset a continued increase in broadband and video revenues.  Wireline IP data revenues, including U-verse, broadband and business products, increased 16.4 percent and now represent 46.8% of total wireline data revenues.
Revenue connections from our wireline consumer customers (retail voice, high speed Internet and video) totaled 46.8 million at quarter-end 2009 versus 49.3 million at quarter-end 2008 and 47.0 million at year-end 2008.  Total wireline consumer broadband and TV connections over the past year increased by 1.7 million.  Our total switched access lines at quarter-end 2009 were 54.0 million compared with 60.4 million in the year-ago quarter.  The number of U-verse subscribers exceeded 1.3 million at quarter-end 2009, with a net gain of 284,00 subscribers in the first quarter of 2009.  U-verse deployment reached nearly 18 million living units as of quarter-end 2009.
Nearly half of U-verse customers choose one of the two largest video packages.  A previous report that they take the largest package was made in error.
