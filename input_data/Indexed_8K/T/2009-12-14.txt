Item 8.01  Other Events.
 
 
On December 14, 2009, AT&T Inc. (AT&T) announced that it had reached agreement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on new, three-year contracts covering approximately 30,000 employees in CWA District 3 (AT&T's Southeast region), subject to approval by these employees.  The previous contracts expired on August 8, 2009 and employees have continued working under the terms of the expired contracts while negotiations continued.
For the vast majority of employees, the new contracts provide for a 3 percent base salary increase in years one and two, a wage increase in year three  of 2.75 percent, and pension band increases of two percent for each year of the agreement.  The new contracts also provide for continued health care coverage with reasonable cost sharing.
Most of the impact from these contracts will be reflected in AT&T financial results beginning in 2010.
Information set forth in this report contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.  A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&Ts filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  AT&T disclaims any obligation to update or revise statements contained in this report based on new information or otherwise.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
