Item 8.01  Other Events.
On August 19, 2010, AT&T Inc. (AT&T) announced that it had reached agreement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) on a new, three-year contract (retroactive to April 4, 2009) covering approximately 4,000 employees in CWA District 1 (AT&T's East region), subject to approval by these employees.  The previous contract expired on April 4, 2009 and employees have continued working under the terms of the expired contract while negotiations continued.
For  most employees, the new contract provides for a 3 percent base salary increase in years one and two, a wage increase in year three of 2.75 percent and resulting pension increases for most employees.  For the wage increase there is a potential cost-of-living increase based on the consumer price index for the third year.  The new contract also provides for continued health care coverage with reasonable cost sharing.
