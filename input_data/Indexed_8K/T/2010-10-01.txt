Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 27, 2010, AT&T reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service on certain tax basis calculations taken on AT&Ts 2008 federal tax return, relating to a restructuring of our wireless operations.  The amortization deductions generated by this settlement are expected to cover a 15-year period, which began in 2008.  As a result of this settlement, we will pay approximately $300 million to the IRS during the fourth quarter of 2010, representing the tax effect of certain disallowed deductions taken in 2008 and 2009.  We will decrease our net tax liabilities by approximately $8.3 billion and the cash flow impacts of the settlement are expected to be recognized over a 15-year period, which began in 2008. 0; The effect of the change to our net tax liabilities will be recognized through our income statement in the third quarter of 2010 as a reduction in income tax expense.
