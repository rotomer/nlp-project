Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
On March 31, 2011, AT&T Inc. ("AT&T") entered into a term credit agreement (the "Agreement"), with certain investment and commercial banks, pursuant to which, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, the lenders committed to provide unsecured bridge financing of up to $20 billion in connection with the acquisition of T-Mobile USA, Inc. (the "Acquisition"). In the event advances are made under the agreement, those advances would be used solely to finance a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The Acquisition is the subject of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 20, 2011, by and between AT&T and Deutsche Telekom AG (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Stock Purchase Agreement").
The description of the Agreement contained in these items 1.01 and 2.03 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10-a to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The obligations of the lenders under the Agreement to provide advances will terminate on September 20, 2012, unless prior to that date: (i) AT&T reduces to $0 the commitments of the lenders under the Agreement, (ii) the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated prior to the date the advances are made, or (iii) certain events of default occur.
Advances would bear interest, at AT&T's option, either:
 
 
that the Applicable Margin set forth above is scheduled to increase by an additional 0.25% on the 90th day after the date the advances are made and another 0.25% every 90 days thereafter.
provided
If AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated at least A by S&P or Fitch or A2 by Moody's, AT&T will pay a facility fee ("Facility Fee") equal to 0.08% of the commitment amount per annum for the first year, and 0.10% per annum thereafter until the termination of the commitments. If AT&T's unsecured long-term debt ratings are A- and A3 (or below), AT&T will pay a facility fee equal to 0.10% of the commitment amount per annum for the first year, and 0.125% per annum thereafter until the termination of the commitments. The Company is scheduled to pay a duration fee of 0.50%, 0.75% and 1.00% on the amount of advances outstanding as of the 90th, 180th and 270th day after advances are made, respectively, if the then outstanding amount of aggregate advances on such date is greater than $10 billion, and 0.00%, 0.50% and 0.75% on the amount of advances outstanding as of the 90th, 180th and 270th day after advances are made, respectively, if the then outstanding amount of aggregate advances on such date is equal to or less than $10 billion.
In the event that AT&T's unsecured long-term debt ratings are split by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, then the Applicable Margin or the Facility Fee, as the case may be, will be determined by the highest of the three ratings,
 
except that in the event the lowest of such ratings is more than one level below the highest of such ratings, then the Applicable Margin or the Facility Fee, as the case may be, will be determined based on the level that is one level above the lowest of such ratings.
As of the date of this filing, AT&T's unsecured long-term debt is rated A- by S&P, A2 by Moody's and A by Fitch. On March 21, 2011, Moody's announced that it had placed its rating of AT&T's debt under review for a possible downgrade, and Fitch announced that it had placed its rating of AT&T's debt on rating watch negative. S&P, Moody's and Fitch may change their ratings at any time and AT&T disclaims any obligation to provide notice of any changes to these ratings.
The Agreement contains provisions requiring the reduction of the commitments of the lenders and the prepayment of outstanding advances by the amount of net cash proceeds resulting from the incurrence of certain indebtedness by AT&T or its subsidiaries, the public issuance of any capital stock by AT&T or its subsidiaries and non-ordinary course sales or dispositions of assets by AT&T or its subsidiaries, in each case subject to exceptions set forth in the Agreement.
Advances under the Agreement are conditioned on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Repayment of all advances must be made no later than the first anniversary of the date on which advances are made.
The Agreement contains certain representations and warranties and covenants, including a negative pledge covenant and a debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant that AT&T will maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1 of:
(A)        all items that would be treated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) as indebtedness on AT&T's consolidated balance sheet, to
(B)        the net income of AT&T and its consolidated subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis for such period in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude the effects of (a) gains or losses from discontinued operations, (b) any extraordinary or other non-recurring non-cash gains or losses (including non-cash restructuring charges), (c) accounting changes including any changes to Accounting Standards Codification 715 (or any subsequently adopted standards relating to pension and postretirement benefits) adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board after the date hereof, (d) interest expense, (e) income tax expense or benefits, (f) depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges (including actuarial gains or losses from pension and postretirement plans), (g) interest income, (h) equity income and losses and (i) other non-operating income or expense. In the event the Borrower acquires or disposes of a material business (as defined in the Agreement) and pro forma financial statements are provided, then net income would be as shown on those statements, subject to the adjustments described above.
Defaults under the Agreement, which would permit the lenders to accelerate required payment and which would increase the Applicable Margin by 2% per annum, include the following:

To each of the Lenders parties
        to the Credit Agreement dated
        as of March [], 2011
    
        among AT&T Inc.,
        said Lenders, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
        as Agent for said Lenders, and other agents parties thereto, and
        to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Pursuant to Section 3.02(b) of the Credit Agreement, dated as of March [__], 2011 (the ""), among AT&T Inc. (the ""), the Lenders parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Agent for said Lenders, and the other agents parties thereto, I am of the opinion that:
Credit Agreement
Borrower
1.        The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2.        The Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding instrument enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity).
3.        Neither the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement or the issuance of the Notes, nor the consummation of any other of the transactions therein contemplated, nor the fulfillment of the terms thereof will conflict with, result in a breach of, or constitute a default under, the charter or bylaws of the Borrower or the terms of any indenture or other agreement or instrument known to me and to which the Borrower is a party or by which the Borrower is bound, or any applicable law, order or regulation known to me to be applicable to the Borrower of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency, governmental body or arbitrator having jurisdiction over the Borrower.
4.        No order, consent, authorization, approval, registration or qualification of or with any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Borrower is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
5.        The form and terms of the Notes have been duly authorized and established by all necessary corporate action, and, when executed and delivered, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrower (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and to general principles of equity).
 
6.        To the best of my knowledge, there is no pending or overtly threatened action, suit or proceedings against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that purport to affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any of the Notes or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby or, if likely to have a materially adverse effect upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower, that is not disclosed in a filing by the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In giving the foregoing opinion, I have assumed that at the time of any Borrowing and the execution of the Notes that any such Borrowing was in accordance with any applicable debt limitations established by the Board of Directors of the Borrower. In addition, I have relied, as to certain matters of fact, upon certificates of responsible officers of the Borrower and public officials.
EXHIBIT E - FORM OF OPINION
OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE AGENT
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent
        under the Credit Agreement,
        as hereinafter defined (the "Agent")
        and
The Lenders listed on Schedule I hereto
        which are parties to the Credit Agreement
        on the date hereof
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of (a) the Credit Agreement and (b) the Notes delivered to the Lenders on the date hereof (together with the Credit Agreement, the "Credit Documents"). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.02(b)(ii) of the Credit Agreement.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined:
 
 
We also have examined the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records, agreements, instruments and other documents and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions expressed herein. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the representations made in the Credit Agreement.
In rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the genuineness of all
 
signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
In rendering the opinion set forth below we have assumed that (1) the Credit Agreement is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Lenders parties thereto, (2) (a) the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Credit Documents in accordance with its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, (b) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Documents do not violate the laws of the State of Delaware or any other applicable laws and (c) execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit Documents do not constitute a breach or violation of any agreement or instrument which is binding upon the Company and (3) the Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of, and subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that each Credit Document constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
Our opinion set forth above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
We express no opinion with respect to:
(A) the effect of any provision of the Credit Documents which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing by the parties thereto;
(B) the effect of any provision of the Credit Documents insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar
 
rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
(C) the effect of any provision of the Credit Documents imposing penalties or forfeitures;
(D) the enforceability of any provision of any of the Credit Documents to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; and
(E) the effect of any provision of the Credit Documents relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement whereby the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1332 on subject matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Credit Agreement which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510 a New York State court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a) a United States District Court has discretion to transfer an action from one Federal court to another.
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York and the Federal law of the United States.
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
