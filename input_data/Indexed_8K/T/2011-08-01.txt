Item 8.01   Other Events
 
Throughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as AT&T. On August 1, 2011, AT&T announced that it would tender all of its shares of Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (Telmex), following an announcement by the Board of Directors of approving a tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Telmex at $10.50 Mexican pesos per share (payable in cash), that are not already owned by Amrica Mvil. This offer would value AT&T's holdings at approximately $1.37 billion (using August 1, 2011 exchange rate). Assuming the tender offer is launched and it is completed, AT&T expects to report a gain of one to three cents per share in respect of the sale of AT&Ts Telmex shares.
Amrica Mvil, S.A. de C.V. (Amrica Mvil)
