The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such

Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than 15 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
Any money that AT&T deposits with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of principal or any interest on this Note that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which the principal and interest are due and payable, will be repaid to AT&T upon AT&T's request unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any applicable unclaimed property law. After that time, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any unclaimed property law, the Holder of this Note will be able to seek any payment to which such Holder may be entitled to collect only from AT&T.
If the Notes are issued in definitive form, payment of the principal and interest on this Note due at the Maturity Date or upon redemption will be made at the Maturity Date or upon redemption, as the case may be, upon presentation of this Note, in immediately available funds, at the office of The Bank of New York Mellon, the Paying and Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Notes, currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286.
Payment of interest on this Note due on an Interest Payment Date, other than interest at maturity or upon redemption, may be paid by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Note register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Depository as Holder of the Notes or (2) a Holder of more than U.S.$5,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes in definitive form is entitled to require the Paying Agent to make payments of interest, other than interest due at maturity or upon redemption, by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account maintained by the Holder in the United States, by sending appropriate wire transfer instructions as long as the Paying Agent receives the instructions not less than ten days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

Trustee's Certificate of Authentication
This is one of the 4.30% Global Notes due 2042
of the series designated herein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, as Trustee
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of AT&T of the series specified on the face hereof, issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1994, between AT&T and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto (collectively, the "Indenture") reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, AT&T and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes will be issued in fully registered form only and in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of AT&T and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by AT&T and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding to waive compliance by AT&T with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of AT&T, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
Registrar and Paying Agent
AT&T shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange ("Registrar") and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment or for exchange ("Paying Agent"). AT&T has initially appointed the Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon, as its Registrar and Paying Agent. AT&T may vary or terminate the appointment of any of its paying or transfer agencies, and may appoint additional paying or transfer agencies.
Optional Redemption by AT&T
The Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at AT&T's option, at any time on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes. The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 25 basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
At any time on or after June 15, 2042, the Company has the option to redeem the Notes, as a whole or in part, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. Accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity or interpolation (on a day count basis) of the interpolated Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with AT&T.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and their respective affiliates and, at the option of the Company, one other nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government Securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"); provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to a Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption, unless AT&T defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, AT&T will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.
Registration Rights
In addition to the rights set forth under the Indenture, Holders of the Notes will enjoy all the rights and be subject to all of the obligations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2012 (the ""), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P.

provided
however
(1) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner, or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or member of the beneficial owner if the beneficial owner is an estate, trust or partnership, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder:
 
(a) is or was present or engaged in trade or business in the United States or has or had a permanent establishment in the United States;

(d) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of AT&T;
(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion thereof, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by AT&T or a Paying Agent from the payment;

(8) in the case of any combination of the above items.
 
Except as specifically provided herein, AT&T shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

Redemption Upon a Tax Event
If (a) AT&T becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendment to, any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 15, 2012, or (b) a taxing authority of the United States takes an action on or after November 15, 2012, whether or not with respect to AT&T or any of its affiliates, that results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then AT&T may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on any interest payment date on not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. However, AT&T may determine, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay these Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless AT&T shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and AT&T shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer stating, that based on such opinion, AT&T is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.

In either instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the Notes will be entitled to the physical delivery in definitive form in exchange for this Note, equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name.
Notes so issued in definitive form will be issued as registered notes in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000, unless otherwise specified by AT&T.

The Notes will be redeemable, as a whole or in part, at AT&T's option, at any time on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each Holder of the Notes. The redemption price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) discounted to the redemption date, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the Treasury Rate (as defined below) and 25 basis points. In either case, accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.
At any time on or after June 15, 2042, the Company has the option to redeem the Notes, as a whole or in part, on at least 30 days', but not more than 60 days', prior notice mailed to the registered address of each holder of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. Accrued interest will be payable to the redemption date.

"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security or securities selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of a comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with AT&T.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Trustee, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and their respective affiliates and, at the option of the Company, one other nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government Securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"); provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
 
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to each Note to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the Note that would be due after the related redemption date but for the redemption. If that redemption date is not an interest payment date with respect to a Note, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on the Note will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on the Note to the redemption date.
On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or any portion of the Notes called for redemption, unless AT&T defaults in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest. On or before the redemption date, AT&T will deposit with a Paying Agent or the Trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the Notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Notes of any series are to be redeemed, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.

(a) is or was present or engaged in trade or business in the United States or has or had a permanent establishment in the United States;

(d) is or was a "10-percent shareholder" of AT&T;
(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion thereof, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by AT&T or a Paying Agent from the payment;

Redemption Upon a Tax Event
If (a) AT&T becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendment to, any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 15, 2012, or (b) a taxing authority of the United States takes an action on or after November 15, 2012, whether or not with respect to AT&T or any of its affiliates, that results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then AT&T may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on any interest payment date on not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. However, AT&T may determine, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay these Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless AT&T shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and AT&T shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer stating, that based on such opinion, AT&T is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.

(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by AT&T or a Paying Agent from the payment;

Redemption Upon a Tax Event
If (a) AT&T becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), or any change in, or amendment to, any official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is announced or becomes effective on or after November 15, 2012, or (b) a taxing authority of the United States takes an action on or after November 15, 2012, whether or not with respect to AT&T or any of its affiliates, that results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay such Additional Amounts, then AT&T may, at its option, redeem, as a whole, but not in part, the Notes on any interest payment date on not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. However, AT&T may determine, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay these Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, not including substitution of the obligor under the Notes. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless AT&T shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that AT&T will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and AT&T shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer stating, that based on such opinion, AT&T is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.

Exhibit 4.5
December 17, 2012
To the Parties Listed on Schedule I
Ladies and Gentlemen:
AT&T Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has made an offer to (i) exchange the securities listed on Schedule C for new series of its senior notes due 2042 (the "New 2042 Notes") or its senior notes due 2045 (the "New 2045 Notes", and together with the New 2042 Notes, the "Initial Securities"), as set forth in the table on Schedule II, as set forth in the Offering Memorandum, dated November 15, 2012 (the "Offering Memorandum"), related thereto. The Initial Securities will be issued upon the terms set forth in the Offering Memorandum, for which the parties listed on Schedule I hereto have severally agreed to act as dealer managers (the "Dealer Managers"), pursuant to a dealer manager agreement, dated as of November 15, 2012 as amended by the Amendment to the Dealer Manager Agreement, dated as of November 16, 2012 (as so amended, the "Manager Agreement"), among the Company and the several Dealer Managers. The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of November 1, 1994, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee") (the "Indenture"). As an inducement to the Dealer Managers, the Company agrees with the Dealer Managers, for the benefit of the holders of the Initial Securities and the Exchange Securities (as defined below) (collectively the "Holders"), as follows:
1. . The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, at its own cost, prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to a proposed offer (the "Registered Exchange Offer") to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof), who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities (the "Exchange Securities", and together with the Initial Securities, the "Securities") of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Initial Securities and the provisions relating to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) that would be registered under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act within 330 days (or if the 330th day is not a business day, the first business day thereafter) after the date of original issue of the Initial Securities (the "Issue Date") and shall keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for not less than 30 days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after commencement of the Registered Exchange Offer (such period being called the "Exchange Offer Registration Period").
Registered Exchange Offer
The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Registered Exchange Offer not later than 360 days after the Issue Date.
If the Company effects the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company will be entitled to close the Registered Exchange Offer 30 days after the commencement thereof provided that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer.
Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer (but in any event not later than 30 days after such effectiveness), it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act.
The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, each Holder which is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "Exchanging Dealer"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Description of the Exchange Offer" or similar section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; provided, however, that in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or a Dealer Manager, such period shall be the lesser of 90 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Dealer Managers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(h) below).
In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(a) mail or otherwise send to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b) utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
(c) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
(d) otherwise comply with all applicable laws.
 
As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
(x) accept for exchange all the Initial Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer;
(y) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(z) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities Exchange Securities equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Initial Securities being exchanged by such Holder, and any Exchange Securities received by such Holder, have been or will be acquired in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such Holder is not engaged and does not intend to engage in and will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
2. . If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company determines that it is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 360 days of the Issue Date, (iii) any Holder (other than as a result of the status of any such Holder as an "affiliate" of the Company or as a broker-dealer) notifies the Company prior to the 20th day following completion of the Registered Exchange Offer that it is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange (it being understood that the requirement that an Exchanging Dealer deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Description of the Exchange Offer" or similar section, and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer shall not result in such Exchange Securities being not "freely transferable"), or (iv) the Company so elects, the Company shall, at its reasonable costs, take the following actions:
Shelf Registration
(a) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 180 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 2) file with the Commission and thereafter shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing), within 270 days after the Company is so required or requested pursuant to this Section 2, a registration statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement" and,
 
together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "Shelf Registration") or, if permitted by 430B under the Securities Act, otherwise designate an existing effective Shelf Registration Statement for use by the Holders as a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities; provided, however, that no Holder (other than a Dealer Manager) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder.
(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of one year (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(h) below) from effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.
3. . In connection with any Shelf Registration contemplated by Section 2 hereof and, to the extent applicable, any Registered Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 1 hereof, the following provisions shall apply:
Registration Procedures
(a) The Company shall (i) include the information set forth in Annex A hereto on the cover, in Annex B hereto in the "Description of the Exchange Offer" or similar section and in Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section of the prospectus forming a part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and include the information set forth in Annex D hereto in the Letter of Transmittal delivered pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer; (ii) include within the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement a section entitled "Plan of Distribution," which shall contain a summary statement of the positions taken or policies made by the staff of the Commission with respect to the potential "underwriter" status of any broker-dealer that is the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of Exchange Securities received by such broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer (a "Participating Broker-Dealer"); and (iv) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, include in the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement (or, if permitted by Commission Rule 430B(b), in a prospectus supplement that becomes a part thereof pursuant to Commission Rule 430B(f)) that is delivered to any Holder pursuant to Section 3(d), the names of the Holders, who propose to sell Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, as selling securityholders.
(b) The Company shall give notice to the Dealer Managers, the Holders of the Securities (in case of any Shelf Registration Statement) and any Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the Company has received prior written notice that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer (which notice pursuant to clauses (ii)-(v) hereof shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes have been made):
(i) when the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective;
 
(ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein;
(iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and of the happening of any event that causes the Company to become an "ineligible issuer," as defined in Commission Rule 405;
(iv) of the receipt by the Company or its legal counsel of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or overtly threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest possible time, of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
(d) The Company shall, during the Shelf Registration Period, deliver to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) included in the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such person may reasonably request. The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of the Securities in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Shelf Registration Statement.
(e) The Company shall deliver to each Dealer Manager, any Exchanging Dealer, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer, without charge, as many copies of the final prospectus included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such persons may reasonably request. The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any Dealer Manager, if necessary, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer in connection with the offering and sale of the Exchange Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement.
(f) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above during the period for which the Company is required to maintain an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus and any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Holders of the Securities or purchasers of Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall also promptly provide notice to the Dealer Managers, the Holders of the Securities (in case of any Shelf Registration Statement) and any known Participating Broker-Dealer of its determination to suspend the availability of a Registration Statement and the related prospectus because the continued effectiveness and use of such Registration Statement and prospectus included therein would require the disclosure of confidential information or interfere with any acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company or any of its consolidated
 
subsidiaries (it being understood that such notice may disclose only the existence of such determination and need not disclose the nature of the basis therefore, which may be kept confidential for such period as may reasonably be required for bona fide business reasons). If the Company notifies the Dealer Managers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer in accordance with paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Dealer Managers, the Holders of the Securities and any such Participating Broker-Dealers shall suspend use of such prospectus, and the period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in Section 2(b) above and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 1 above, as applicable, shall each be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Dealer Managers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 3(f). During the period during which the Company is required to maintain an effective Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will prior to the three-year expiration of that Shelf Registration Statement file, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective automatically upon filing) within a period that avoids any interruption in the ability of Holders of Securities covered by the expiring Shelf Registration Statement to make registered dispositions, a new registration statement relating to the Securities, which shall be deemed the "Shelf Registration Statement" for purposes of this Agreement.
(g) Not later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, the Company will provide a CUSIP number for the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities, as the case may be, and provide the applicable trustee with printed certificates for the Initial Securities or the Exchange Securities, as the case may be, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company.
(h) The Company will comply in all material respects with all rules and regulations of the Commission to the extent and so long as they are applicable to the Registered Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration.
(i) The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act"), as amended, in a timely manner and containing such changes, if any, as shall be necessary for such qualification. In the event that such qualification would require the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
(j) The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
(k) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Securities covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby.
 
4. . The Company shall bear all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 1 through 3 hereof.
Registration Expenses
5. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of the Securities (with respect to a Shelf Registration Statement only), any Participating Broker-Dealer and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or such Participating Broker-Dealer within the meaning of the Securities Act (each Holder, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such controlling persons are referred to collectively as the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, and any action in respect thereof, to which that Indemnified Party may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement at any time or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Commission Rule 433 ("Issuer FWP"), or arises out of, or is based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter or controlling person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred (but no more frequently than annually); provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or Issuer FWP in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Securities was required to be delivered (including through satisfaction of the conditions of Commission Rule 172) by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer results from the fact that there was not conveyed to such person, at or prior to the time of the sale of such Securities to such person, an amended or supplemented prospectus or, if permitted by Section 3(d), an Issuer FWP correcting such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer; provided further, however, that this indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such Indemnified Party.
Indemnification
(b) Each Holder of the Securities and each Participating Broker-Dealer, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the applicable Registration Statement and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, and any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement at any time or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Issuer FWP, or arises out of, or is based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse the Company for any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, or any such director, officer or controlling person in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any
 
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred (but no more frequently than annually), but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its director, officers or controlling persons.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Paragraph 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action, provided that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under Section 5(a) or 5(b). If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party shall not elect to assume the defense of such action, such indemnifying party will reimburse such indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include both the Company and one or more Holders or Participating Broker-Dealers and either (i) the indemnifying party or parties and indemnified party or parties mutually agree or (ii) representation of both the indemnifying party or parties and the indemnified party or parties by the same counsel is inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct or in the opinion of such counsel due to actual or potential differing interests between them, then the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party and will reimburse such indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them and satisfactory to the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all such indemnified parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Joint-Lead Dealer Managers (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) in the case of an action in which one or more Holders, Participating Broker-Dealers or controlling persons are indemnified parties and by the Company in the case of an action in which the Company or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons are indemnified parties. The indemnifying party or parties shall not be liable under this Agreement with respect to any settlement made by any indemnified party or parties without prior written consent by the indemnifying party or parties to such settlement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 shall for any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 5(a) or 5(b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Holders or Participating Broker-Dealers on the other hand from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer. If, however, this allocation is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage
 
or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Holders or Participating Broker-Dealers on the other hand from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, and the relative fault of Company on the one hand and the Holders or Participating Broker-Dealers on the other hand with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Holders or Participating Broker-Dealers, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 5(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 5(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph 9(d), no Holder of Securities or Participating Broker-Dealer shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders or Participating Broker-Dealer from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders or Participating Broker-Dealer have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
6. . (a) Additional interest (the "Additional Interest") with respect to the Initial Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below a "Registration Default"):
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances
(i) If the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the 330th day after the Issue Date;
(ii) If neither the Registered Exchange Offer is consummated within 360 days after the Issue Date nor, if required in lieu thereof, the Shelf Registration Statement has become effective within 270 days after the date, if any, on which the Company became obligated to file the Shelf Registration Statement;
(iii) If after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable (except as permitted in paragraph (b) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities) prior to the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (unless such ineffectiveness is cured within the 330-day period described in Section 6(a)(i) above); or
(iv) If after the Shelf Registration Statement, if applicable, is declared (or becomes automatically) effective, and for a period time that exceeds 180 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period in which the Registration Statement is required to be effective (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective during the period required herein; or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable (except as permitted in
 
paragraph (b)) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, or (3) the Registration Statement has expired before a replacement Shelf Registration Statement has become effective.
Additional Interest shall accrue on the Initial Securities over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured. Additional Interest shall accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum while any Registration Default is continuing, until all Registration Defaults have been cured. Following the cure of all Registration Defaults, the accrual of Additional Interest on the Initial Securities will cease and the interest rate will revert to the applicable original rate set forth in the title of the Securities. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay Additional Interest for (i) more than one Registration Default under this Section 6(a) at any one time or (ii) for a period of more than one year (or for such longer period as extended pursuant to Section 3(h)) from the Issue Date for any Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iv)(B) with respect to a Registration Statement.
(b) A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iii) or Section 6(a)(iv)(B) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
(c) Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 6(a) above will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Initial Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest rate by the principal amount of the Initial Securities, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of section 6(a) above will constitute liquated damages and will be the exclusive remedy, monetary or otherwise, available to any Holder with respect to any Registration Default.
(d) "Transfer Restricted Securities" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Transfer Restricted Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of a Initial Security for an Exchange Security, the date on which such Exchange Security is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a
 
copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Initial Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement, (iv) the date on which such Initial Security is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or (v) the earliest date that is no less than two years after the Issue Date on which such Security (except for Securities held by an affiliate of the Company) may be resold in reliance on paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
7. . The Company shall, to the extent it is required to do so under the Exchange Act, use its commercially reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, use its commercially reasonable efforts to make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Initial Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Initial Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.
Rules 144 and 144A

This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, for a period of 90 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."

ANNEX C

Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act.
