Exhibit 99.1 Coors Achieves Higher Third Quarter Sales, Net Income and Earnings per Share GOLDEN, Colo., Oct. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Adolph Coors Company (NYSE: RKY) today announced higher consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003. For the 13-week quarter ended Sept. 28, 2003, the company reported consolidated net sales of $1.0 billion, a 3.9 percent increase over last year. Third quarter 2003 sales volume totaled 8,772,000 U.S. barrels, or 10,293,591 hectoliters (HLs), up 4.3 percent from a year ago. The company achieved consolidated 2003 third quarter net income of $61.4 million, a 31.8 percent increase from the third quarter of 2002. Third quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 31.3 percent to $1.68. Leo Kiely, Coors Brewing Company (CBC) president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, third quarter results for Coors Brewing Company reflect a considerable improvement from first-half results. Despite continuing industry headwinds in the U.S., we made progress in key areas of both our Americas and Europe segments. Although we continued to face a challenging volume environment in the U.S., we made significant progress in reducing operations costs and improving our sales mix. Our businesses in Canada and Puerto Rico also boosted third quarter Americas results. In Europe, very strong volume growth resulted primarily from a combination of solid sales execution, unusually warm summer weather this year and an easy comparison to weak sales in July last year. Meanwhile, cost savings from closing our Cape Hill brewery largely offset the loss of income in the quarter this year from contract brewing and transitional services arrangements, most of which concluded late last year. "Looking ahead, we plan to reduce U.S. distributor inventories in the fourth quarter to be roughly in line with levels at the end of 2002, which may impact our ability to grow sales and leverage fixed costs in the quarter. We'll continue our efforts to improve top-line growth in the U.S. by leveraging our NFL sponsorship and other marketing properties, as well as focusing on retail execution in key markets and channels. In Europe, our goal is to maintain strong momentum behind our key brands, especially Carling and Grolsch, while continuing to achieve a more profitable balance between volume and margin in the off-trade channel. We made significant progress on this last goal toward the end of the third quarter." Kiely added, "As previously announced, we implemented significant new supply-chain information systems and processes in our U.S. business at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In preparation, we increased distributor inventories by about 100,000 barrels above usual seasonal levels prior to the end of the third quarter. The distributor inventory build has helped us to work through some of the implementation challenges related to a system rollout of this magnitude. Nonetheless, in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter we've had some challenges shipping enough beer to meet demand from our distributors. This has resulted in additional costs in the range of about $1 million to $3 million during the first three weeks of the quarter, primarily in higher freight costs. We believe that our contingency planning and mitigation efforts have limited the sales impact of the transition, but we have more work to do to get all of these systems working smoothly." Americas Segment Results The Americas segment net sales were $640.4 million, a 2.6 percent increase from a year earlier. Third quarter 2003 sales volume totaled 5,960,000 U.S. barrels (6,993,822 HLs), up 0.1 percent from 2002. Distributor sales to retail decreased approximately 0.3 percent compared to the third quarter of 2002. Pretax income in the Americas segment increased 17.8 percent to $72.6 million. The company's Coors Light business in Canada posted pretax earnings of $15.1 million, up 36.6 percent from a year ago, driven by high-single-digit volume growth, improved beer pricing and favorable currency exchange rates. Europe Segment Results Europe net sales increased 6.2 percent in the third quarter of 2003. Sales volume of owned and licensed beverage brands totaled 2,812,000 U.S. barrels (3,299,770 HLs), up 14.7 percent from a year ago. Third quarter Europe segment pretax income of $46.6 million was up 18.9 percent from a year ago. In addition to strong volume growth, Europe segment results benefited from a one-time gain of $3.5 million pretax, or $0.06 per share after tax, on the sale of the rights to the company's Hooper's Hooch flavored alcohol beverage brand in Russia. The gain is included as a reduction in Europe segment Marketing, General & Administrative expense. This sale is consistent with the company's efforts to convert non-core assets into cash and to increase returns on capital. Adolph Coors Company will conduct a conference call with financial analysts and investors at noon Eastern Time today to discuss the company's third quarter financial results. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible via the company's website, www.coors.com , in the "Invest In Us" area of the site. An online replay of the conference call webcast will be available within two hours following the live webcast until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 23, 2003.
