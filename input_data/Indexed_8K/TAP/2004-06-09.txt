EXHIBIT INDEX ------------- Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Release dated June 9, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 Coors Completes Sale of Cape Hill Brewery in the U.K. GOLDEN, Colo., June 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Adolph Coors Company (NYSE: RKY) today announced the sale of property related to the former Cape Hill brewery in Birmingham, England. The sale is consistent with the company's objective to convert non-core assets to cash, accelerate debt repayments and grow returns on capital. The Cape Hill transaction, completed in late May, involved the sale of nearly 80 acres of property related to the company's former brewing operation in Birmingham. Coors ceased brewing operations at the Cape Hill facility in late 2002. The property was sold to U.K.-based developer Persimmon PLC for 26 million British pounds sterling (approximately $46 million based on current exchange rates), with 6 million pounds payable in 2004 and 20 million pounds due in 2005. Coors expects the Cape Hill property sale to result in a one-time pretax gain of 4 million British pounds (approximately $7 million), which the company anticipates recording in the fourth quarter of 2004 after all of the 2004 payment has been received. Founded in 1873, Adolph Coors Company is the world's ninth-largest brewer. Its principal subsidiary is Coors Brewing Company, the third-largest brewer in the U.S., with a beverage portfolio that includes Coors Light, Coors Original, Aspen Edge, Killian's, Zima and the Keystone family of brands. The company's operating unit in the United Kingdom, Coors Brewers Limited, is the U.K.'s second-largest brewer, with brands that include Carling -- the best-selling beer in the U.K. -- Grolsch, Worthington's, Reef and the recently launched Coors Fine Light Beer. Adolph Coors Company stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RKY. For more information on Adolph Coors Company, visit the company's website at www.coors.com.
