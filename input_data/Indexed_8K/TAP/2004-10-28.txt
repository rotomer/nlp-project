EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release of Adolph Coors Company dated October 28, 2004, reporting Adolph Coors Company financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2004 ended September 26, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Coors Reports 2004 Third Quarter Results GOLDEN, Colo., Oct. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Adolph Coors Company (NYSE: RKY) today announced higher consolidated net sales and net income on lower consolidated sales volume for the third quarter of 2004. For the 13-week quarter ended September 26, 2004, the company achieved consolidated net sales of $1.10 billion, a 5.3 percent increase from third quarter 2003. Third quarter 2004 sales volume totaled 8,559,000 U.S. barrels, or 10,043,650 hectoliters (HLs), a 2.4 percent decrease from 2003. Third quarter operating income was $103.9 million, down 5.0 percent from the same period a year ago. Consolidated third quarter 2004 net income was $64.1 million, up 4.4 percent from third quarter 2003, and earnings per share were $1.68, equal to the third quarter last year. Leo Kiely, Coors Brewing Company (CBC) president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, the third quarter was a tough volume quarter for Coors Brewing Company, with weak trends in both our Americas and Europe segments. Nonetheless, our net income was higher due to improved beer pricing, one-time non-operating income, a lower effective tax rate and favorable exchange rates compared to the third quarter of last year. "In Europe, our results in local currency were impacted substantially by cold and very wet weather in the third quarter of this year compared with unusually hot, dry weather in the same period last year. The negative impact of lower volume and higher costs was offset partly by continued solid pricing gains in the on-trade. Even with the volume challenges, our top-selling Carling brand gained share during the quarter. "In the Americas, sales to retail were down slightly, consistent with trends earlier in the year. During the quarter, the entire beer category was challenged by generally unfavorable weather in much of the U.S. Although Coors Light sales declined at a low-single-digit rate, the brand's trends improved in several key areas of the U.S. Americas cost of goods per barrel were higher, primarily due to increases in transportation costs, lower sales volume and a sales mix shift toward more expensive, higher-margin brands and packages, offset partially by continued improvements in operations productivity. "For the balance of 2004, we are focused on achieving a strong finish to the year. In the U.S., we will be lapping significant volume declines and additional costs related to our supply-chain disruptions in the fourth quarter of last year. Our new systems are now running smoothly and have resulted in substantially improved service to our distributors. In the U.K., in addition to our expectations that positive on-trade pricing will continue, we believe volume trends will improve from a difficult summer. On the other hand, if foreign exchange rates remain at today's levels, we anticipate less currency benefit to our U.K. financial results in the fourth quarter. "We also continue to work toward closing our merger of equals with Molson. The transaction has received U.S. and Canadian anti-trust clearance, and we have filed a preliminary proxy statement for SEC review. This transaction will build on the strengths of both companies, make us more competitive in the consolidating global beer market and increase profits, cash flow and shareholder value substantially in both the short and long term." Americas Segment Results Americas segment net sales increased 3.4 percent compared to the third quarter 2003. Americas distributor sales to retail declined about 0.3 percent. Third quarter 2004 sales volume totaled 5,922,000 U.S. barrels (6,949,230 HLs), a 0.6 percent decrease from 2003. Americas segment pretax earnings were $83.1 million, up 14.4 percent from the third quarter 2003. Americas segment results benefited from $4.9 million of accelerated royalty receipts from a coal mine sold several years ago, a $0.8 million pretax gain on the sale of a warehouse (both reported in other income), and $3.1 million of minority owners' income attributable to the company's U.S. container joint ventures. The company's business in Canada achieved pretax earnings of $17.5 million in the third quarter 2004, up 15.9 percent from 2003, driven by increased beer pricing and a 4.9 percent appreciation in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in sales volume. In the first three quarters of 2004, the company's Coors Light business in Canada has achieved pretax earnings of $45.0 million in 2004, a 28.7 percent increase from a year earlier. Europe Segment Results In the third quarter 2004, Europe segment net sales increased 8.3 percent from the third quarter of 2003 to $442.1 million. Third quarter 2004 sales volume of owned and licensed beverage brands totaled 2,637,000 U.S. barrels (3,094,410 HLs), down 6.2 percent from a year ago. As a result, Europe segment pretax earnings were $40.6 million, down 12.9 percent from the third quarter 2003, despite a 12.8 percent appreciation of the British Pound versus the U.S. dollar. Europe segment results also were impacted by the lapping of a one-time gain of $3.5 million pretax on the sale of the rights to the company's Hooper's Hooch flavored alcohol beverage brand in Russia during the third quarter of 2003. New Accounting Rule This year, Coors began consolidating its U.S. container joint ventures and its U.K. venture with Grolsch under a new U.S. accounting standard, FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." The implementation of the new accounting standard: * decreased Americas segment cost of goods sold by $3.4 million; * reduced Europe segment cost of goods sold by $8.2 million and increased Europe segment marketing, general and administrative expenses by $6.3 million; and * increased corporate interest expense by $0.8 million. Taken together, these factors positively affected consolidated pretax income and were offset by a negative $4.0 million in minority interest -- the minority owners' share of joint-venture income now consolidated and included in Coors' operating results. Adolph Coors Company will conduct a conference call with financial analysts and investors at noon Eastern Time today to discuss the company's third quarter financial results. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible via the company's website, www.coors.com, in the "Invest In Us" area of the site. An online replay of the conference call webcast will be available beginning on October 29, 2004, until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 28, 2004.
