Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
        On November 11, 2004, Adolph Coors Company ("Coors") and Molson Inc. ("Molson") entered into an amendment of the Combination Agreement, dated July 21, 2004, related to the planned merger of the two companies.
        The terms of the amendment to the Combination Agreement provide that, as previously announced, Molson shareholders will receive a special dividend as part of the combination transaction. Pentland Securities (1981) Inc., a company owned by Eric H. Molson and Stephen T. Molson and controlled by Eric H. Molson, has agreed to forego any participation in the special dividend. The special dividend provides that both Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders, excluding Pentland, will receive C$3.26 per share, or a total of approximately C$381 million (US$316 million), payable as part of the plan of arrangement to Molson shareholders of record as of the last trading day immediately prior to the date of the closing of the merger transaction.
        The amendment to the Combination Agreement further provides that Molson's optionholders will vote separately from the stockholders and will only vote with respect to those provisions of the Arrangement which effect the exchange of their options for options to purchase shares of Coors' Class B Common Stock.
        Certain other amendments and agreements were included in the amendment to the Combination Agreement. A complete copy of the amendment is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The amendment to the Combination Agreement should be read together with the original Combination Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Annex B-1 to the amended preliminary joint proxy statement/management information circular regarding the proposed transaction filed by Coors with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 2004.
        Molson is currently authorized to brew, distribute and sell Coors brands in Canada under agreements between Molson and Coors and currently brews, distributes and sells the Coors Light brand in Canada. Coors also sells the Molson family of brands in the United States through a joint venture.
        
This Form 8-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by such terms and phrases as "would", "may", "will", "expects" or "expected to" and other terms with similar meaning indicating possible future events or actions or potential impact on the businesses or shareholders of Adolph Coors Company and Molson Inc. (separately and together the "Companies"). Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the anticipated benefits, savings and synergies of the merger between Adolph Coors Company and Molson Inc., including future financial and operating results, Coors' and Molson's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the markets for Coors' and Molson's products, the future development of Coors' and Molson's business, and the contingencies and uncertainties to which Coors and Molson may be subject and other statements that are not historical facts. This filing and the attached press release also includes information that has not been reviewed by the Companies' independent auditors. There is no assurance the transaction contemplated in this filing will be completed at all, or completed upon the same terms and conditions described. All forward-looking statements in this filing are expressly qualified by information contained in each company's filings with regulatory authorities. The Companies do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
        
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain required approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule; the failure of Coors and Molson stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any revenue synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; and disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers. Additional factors that could cause Coors' and Molson's results to differ materially from those described in the
forward-looking statements can be found in the periodic reports filed by Coors with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov). Neither Coors nor Molson undertakes and each specifically disclaims, any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
        
Coors has filed a preliminary joint proxy statement/management information circular regarding the proposed transaction with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stockholders are urged to read the definitive joint proxy statement/management information circular when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Stockholders will be able to obtain a free copy of the definitive joint proxy statement/management information circular, as well as other filings containing information about Coors, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov). Copies of the definitive joint proxy statement/management information circular and the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will be incorporated by reference in the definitive joint proxy statement/management information circular can also be obtained, without charge, by directing a request to Adolph Coors Company, 311 10th Street, Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: Investor Relations, (303) 279-6565. The respective directors and executive officers of Coors and Molson and other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed merger. Information regarding Coors's and Molson's directors and executive officers, and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is available in the preliminary joint proxy statement/management information circular filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

each Molson Class B Share in respect of which a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form has not been deposited with the Depositary on or prior to the Election Deadline will be deemed to be subject to an election to receive (a) where the address of the holder of such Molson Class B Shares as shown in the register of Molson Class B Shares as of the close of business (Montreal time) on the day preceding the Effective Date is in Canada, the consideration set out in section 2.2(b)(2)(A) and (b) in all other cases, the consideration set out in section 2.2(b)(2)(C);
(i)
each Molson Option shall be exchanged with Coors for a fully vested option (a "
Replacement Option
") to purchase a number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of Molson Class A Shares subject to such Molson Option. Such Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per share of Coors Class B Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such Molson Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. If the foregoing calculation results in a Replacement Option of a particular holder being exercisable for a total number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock that includes a fraction of a share of Coors Class B Common Stock, then the total number of shares of Coors Class B Common Stock subject to such Replacement Option shall be rounded down to the next whole number of Coors Class B Common Stock and the total exercise price for the Replacement Option will be reduced by the exercise price of the fractional share of Coors Class B Common Stock. In addition, if required, the exercise price of each Replacement Option will be increased such that the excess, if any, of the aggregate fair market value of the shares of Coors Class B Common Stock subject to such Replacement Option immediately after the exchange over the aggregate exercise price under the Replacement Option does not exceed the excess, if any, of the aggregate fair market value of the Molson Class A Shares subject to the Molson Option immediately before the exchange over the aggregate exercise price under such Molson Option where all amounts are computed in Canadian dollars using the Currency Exchange Rate on the Effective Date. Subject to Appendix III hereto, the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, and all other terms and conditions of a Replacement Option will otherwise be unchanged, and any document or agreement previously evidencing a Molson Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such Replacement Option.
        At the Listing Time, the holder of each outstanding Class A Preferred Share will transfer each such share to Callco in exchange for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Coors Class A Common Stock. The holder of each outstanding Class B1 Preferred Share and each outstanding Class B2 Preferred Share will transfer each such share to Callco in exchange for one fully paid and non-assessable share of Coors Class B Common Stock as the aggregate consideration receivable for one Class B1 Preferred Share plus one Class B2 Preferred Share. The names of the holders of the Preferred Shares transferred to Callco in exchange for Coors Common Stock shall be removed from
the applicable register of holders of each class of Preferred Shares and added to the applicable register of holders of the appropriate class of Coors Common Stock, and Callco shall be recorded as the registered holder of the Preferred Shares so exchanged and shall be deemed to be legal and beneficial owner thereof. Any fractional interest in a Class A Preferred Share or Class B1 Preferred Share and Class B2 Preferred Share will also be transferred to Callco in exchange for a fractional interest in a share of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, respectively, which will be dealt with as set forth in Section 4.4.
2.3   Elections
        Each beneficial owner of Molson Shares who is a Canadian Resident, (other than any such owner who is exempt from tax under Part I of the ITA and, in the case of a partnership, all of the members of which who are residents of Canada are exempt from tax under Part I of the ITA), and who has validly elected (or for whom the holder has validly elected on such beneficial owner's behalf) to receive consideration that includes Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled to make an income tax election pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the ITA or, if the beneficial owner is a partnership, subsection 85(2) of the ITA (and in each case, where applicable, the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial income tax legislation) with respect to the transfer of its Molson Shares to Exchangeco by providing two signed copies of the necessary prescribed election form(s) to Exchangeco within 75 days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the number and class of Molson Shares transferred and the allocation of any Preferred Share received as consideration to the shares so transferred and the applicable agreed amounts (which, in respect of the transfer of Molson Class A Shares or Molson Class B Shares, cannot be less than the sum of the fair market values of the Preferred Shares and ancillary rights allocated to such Molson Shares) for the purposes of such elections. Thereafter, subject to the election form(s) being correct and complete and complying with the provisions of the ITA (or the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial income tax legislation), the form(s) will be signed by Exchangeco and returned to such beneficial owner of Molson Shares within 45 days after the receipt thereof by Exchangeco for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the applicable provincial taxing authority) by such beneficial owner. Exchangeco will not be responsible for the proper completion of any election form and, except for Exchangeco's obligation to sign and return duly completed election form(s) which are received by Exchangeco within 75 days of the Effective Date, within 45 days after the receipt thereof by Exchangeco, Exchangeco will not be responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the failure by a beneficial owner of Molson Shares to properly complete or file the election form(s) in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial income tax legislation). In its sole discretion, Exchangeco may choose to sign and return an election form received by Exchangeco more than 75 days following the Effective Date, but Exchangeco will have no obligation to do so. References in this Section to the ITA are to the ITA as of the date hereof and any modifications thereof which are consistent with the general principle thereof.
2.4   Adjustments to Exchange Ratios
        The Exchange Ratios shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Coors Common Stock or Molson Shares other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Coors Common Stock or Molson Shares occurring after the date of the Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.
3.1   Rights of Dissent
        Holders of Molson Shares may exercise rights of dissent with respect to such shares pursuant to and in the manner set forth in section 190 of the CBCA and this section 3.1 (the "
Dissent Rights
") in connection with the Arrangement; provided that, notwithstanding subsection 190(5) of the CBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in subsection 190(5) of the CBCA must be received by Molson not later than 5:00 p.m. (Montreal time) on the Business Day preceding the Molson Meeting. Holders of Molson Shares who duly exercise such rights of dissent and who:
(a)
are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value for their Molson Shares shall be deemed to have transferred such Molson Shares to Exchangeco, to the extent the fair value therefor is paid by Exchangeco, and to Molson, to the extent the fair value therefor is paid by Molson, and, in the case of Molson Shares so transferred to Molson such shares shall be cancelled as of the Effective Date; or
(b)
are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for their Molson Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Molson Shares and shall receive the appropriate Exchangeable Shares or Preferred Shares that are in turn exchanged for shares of Coors Common Stock on the basis determined in accordance with sections 2.2(g) and 2.2(h), and the post-amble to section 2.2 as well as the amount of the special dividend payable to such shareholders pursuant to section 2.2(a),
but in no case shall Coors, Exchangeco, Callco, Molson or any other Person be required to recognize such holders as holders of Molson Shares after the Effective Time, and the names of such holders of Molson Shares shall be deleted from the registers of holders of Molson Shares at the Effective Time.
        Molson shall pay to holders of Molson Shares who have duly exercised their rights of dissent and who are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value for their Molson Shares any special dividend payable to such shareholders pursuant to section 2.2(a) on the date that such shareholders are required to be paid the fair value for their Molson Shares. For the purposes of determining "fair value" pursuant to section 190 of the CBCA payable to such holders, the Court shall exclude the amount of the special dividend from the fair value of the shares otherwise determined thereunder.
4.1   Issuance of Certificates Representing Exchangeable Shares
        At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Molson Shares who will receive Exchangeable Shares in connection with the Arrangement, certificates representing that number of whole Exchangeable Shares to be delivered pursuant to section 2.2 upon the exchange of Molson Shares. Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Molson Shares that were exchanged for, or for consideration that includes, Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement, together with such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Molson, and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that number (rounded down to
the nearest whole number) of the appropriate class of Exchangeable Shares which such holder has the right to receive (together with any certificates representing Coors Common Stock pursuant to section 4.2, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to section 4.3 and any cash in respect of a fractional interest in a share pursuant to section 4.4, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof), and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Molson Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Molson, a certificate representing the proper number of Exchangeable Shares may be issued to the transferee if the certificate representing such Molson Shares is presented to the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Molson Shares that were exchanged for, or for consideration that includes, Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the certificate representing Exchangeable Shares as contemplated by this section 4.1, (ii) the certificate representing any shares of Coors Common Stock the holder is entitled to pursuant to section 4.2, (iii) a cash payment in respect of any fractional interest in a share as contemplated by section 4.4 and (iv) any dividends or distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to such shares as contemplated by section 4.3, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7.
4.2   Certificates Representing Preferred Shares and Coors Common Stock
        At or promptly after the Effective Time, Exchangeco shall deposit with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Molson Shares who will receive Preferred Shares (including any fractional interest in a Preferred Share) in connection with the Arrangement, global certificates representing that number of Class A Preferred Shares and that number of Class B1 Preferred Shares and Class B2 Preferred Shares to be delivered to holders of Molson Shares pursuant to section 2.2 upon the exchange of Molson Shares. At or promptly after the Listing Time, (i) the Depositary (on behalf of the holders of such Preferred Shares) will deliver such global certificates to Callco, (ii) the Depositary (on behalf of Exchangeco) will cancel such global certificates and deliver to Callco new certificates representing that number of Class A Preferred Shares and that number of Class B1 Preferred Shares and Class B2 Preferred Shares transferred by former holders of Molson Shares to Callco pursuant to section 2.2, and (iii) Callco shall deposit (or shall cause Coors to deposit) with the Depositary, for the benefit of the holders of Class A Preferred Shares, Class B1 Preferred Shares and Class B2 Preferred Shares that are transferred to Callco for Coors Class A Common Stock and Coors Class B Common Stock in connection with the Arrangement, certificates representing that number of whole shares of Coors Class A Common Stock and that number of whole shares of Coors Class B Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to section 2.2 upon the exchange of Preferred Shares for Coors Common Stock. Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged for, or for consideration that includes, Preferred Shares that were in turn exchanged for shares of Coors Common Stock under the Arrangement, together with such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the shares formerly represented by such certificate under the CBCA and the Articles and by-laws of Molson, and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, a certificate representing that number of shares of the appropriate class of Coors Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in exchange for Preferred Shares (together with any certificates representing Exchangeable Shares pursuant to section 4.1, any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to section 4.3 and any cash in respect of a fractional interest in a share pursuant to section 4.4, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof), and the certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Molson Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of Molson, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Coors Common Stock may be issued to the transferee if the certificate representing such Molson Shares is presented to the Depositary, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Until surrendered as contemplated by this section 4.2, each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged for, or for consideration that includes, Preferred Shares that were in turn exchanged for shares of Coors Common Stock shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (i) the certificate representing the shares of the appropriate class of Coors Common Stock received in exchange for Preferred Shares as contemplated by this section 4.2, (ii) the certificate representing any Exchangeable Shares the holder is entitled to pursuant to section 4.1, (iii) a cash payment in respect of a fractional interest in a share as contemplated by section 4.4 and (iv) any dividends or distributions with a record date after the Listing Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to such shares as contemplated by section 4.3, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7.
4.3   Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates
        No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares or Coors Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2, and no cash payment in respect of a fractional interest in a share shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to section 4.4 and no interest shall be earned or payable on these proceeds, unless and until the holder of such certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with section 4.1 or 4.2. Subject to applicable law, at the time of such surrender of any such certificate (or, in the case of clause (iii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates previously representing Molson Shares, without interest, (i) the amount of any cash payable in respect of a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share or share of Coors Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to section 4.4, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to the Exchangeable Shares or after the Listing Time theretofore paid with respect to Coors Common Stock, as the case may be, to which such holder is entitled pursuant hereto and (iii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time or after the Listing Time, as the case may be, but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such Exchangeable Shares or Coors Common Stock, as the case may be.
4.4   No Fractional Shares
        No certificates representing fractional Exchangeable Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of certificates pursuant to section 4.1 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the capital structure of Exchangeco shall relate to any such fractional security and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise any rights as a security holder of Exchangeco. Each Person otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable Share or a fractional interest in a share of Coors Common Stock upon the exchange of a fractional interest in a Preferred Share will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to such Person's pro rata portion of the net proceeds after expenses received by the Depositary upon the sale of whole shares representing an accumulation of all fractional interests in Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock, to which all such Persons would otherwise be entitled. The Depositary will sell such Exchangeable Shares by private sale (including by way sale through the facilities of any stock exchange upon which the Exchangeable Shares are then listed) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after expenses of such sale will be distributed by the Depositary, pro rata in relation to the respective fractions, among Persons otherwise entitled to receive fractional interests in Exchangeable
Shares. The Depositary will sell such shares of Coors Common Stock on the TSX, or if the shares of Coors Common Stock are not listed on the TSX, on the NYSE as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after expenses of such sale will be distributed by the Depositary, pro rata in relation to the respective fractions, among Persons otherwise entitled to receive fractional interests in shares of Coors Common Stock.
        A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall not be entitled to any fraction of a share of Coors Common Stock upon the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right or the Redemption Call Right and no certificate representing any such fractional interest shall be issued and such holder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest will receive for such fractional interest from Callco or Coors, as the case may be, on the designated payment date a cash payment equal to such fractional interest multiplied by the Coors Trading Price.
4.5   Lost Certificates
        In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, any cash pursuant to section 4.4 and/or one or more certificates representing one or more Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable in accordance with such holder's Letter of Transmittal and Election Form. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom certificates representing Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to Exchangeco, Coors and their respective Transfer Agents in such sum as Exchangeco or Coors may direct or otherwise indemnify Exchangeco and Coors in a manner satisfactory to Exchangeco and Coors against any claim that may be made against Exchangeco or Coors with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
4.6   Extinction of Rights
        Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Molson Shares that were exchanged pursuant to section 2.2 that is not deposited with all other instruments required by section 4.1 or 4.2 on or prior to the date of the notice referred to in section 7.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, or that were transferred to Exchangeco or Molson, as applicable, pursuant to section 3.1(a), shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or nature as a shareholder of Exchangeco or Coors. On such date, the Exchangeable Shares or shares of Coors Common Stock (or cash in respect of fractional interests therein, as provided in section 4.4) to which the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Exchangeco or Coors, as the case may be, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder. None of Molson, Coors, Exchangeco, Callco or the Depositary shall be liable to any person in respect of any Coors Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares (or dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
4.7   Withholding Rights
        Molson, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Molson Shares, Preferred Shares, Coors Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Molson, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary is (i) required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the
ITA, the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986
or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended or succeeded, or (ii) entitled to deduct and withhold under section 116 of the ITA or any corresponding provisions of provincial law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Molson, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Molson, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement and Molson, Exchangeco, Callco, Coors or the Depositary shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale, provided however that nothing in this section 4.7 shall reduce Exchangeco's obligations under section 6.1(h) of the Combination Agreement or section 3.2 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions. References in this section to the ITA are to the ITA as amended from time to time.
5.1   Callco Liquidation Call Right
(a)
Callco shall have the overriding right (the "
Liquidation Call Right
"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an affiliate of Coors) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco of an amount per share (the "
Liquidation Call Purchase Price
") equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Stock, plus (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share, and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the holders of such shares so purchased by Callco.
(b)
To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify Exchangeco's Transfer Agent (the "
Transfer Agent
"), as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of Callco's intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price.
(c)
For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be delivered with the Transfer Agent,
on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price for all holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates), less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) will be limited to receiving, without interest, such holder's proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents, instruments and payments (including without limitation Stamp Taxes) as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the articles and by-laws of Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder, certificates representing the shares of Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Exchangeco pursuant to Article 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.
5.2   Callco Redemption Call Right
        In addition to Callco's rights contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions), Callco shall have the following rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares:
(a)
Callco shall have the overriding right (the "
Redemption Call Right
"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by Exchangeco pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an affiliate of Coors) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco to each holder of an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "
Redemption Call Purchase Price
") equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Stock, plus (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Redemption Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share, and Exchangeco shall have no obligation to redeem, or to pay any Dividend Amount in respect of, such shares so purchased by Callco.
(b)
To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, and Exchangeco of Callco's intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase Price.
(c)
For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Redemption Date each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder's proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA, and the articles and by-laws of Exchangeco and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to section 4.7 hereof. If Callco does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on the Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the redemption price otherwise payable by Exchangeco in connection with the redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.
6.1   Amendments to Plan of Arrangement
(a)
Notwithstanding the approval of this Plan of Arrangement at the Molson Meeting by the required majorities of holders of Molson Shares, if the holders of Molson Options at the Molson Meeting do not approve a special resolution adopting section 2.2(i) of this Plan of Arrangement, this Plan of Arrangement shall be amended by deleting section 2.2(i).

Coors, (iii) filed with the Court and, if made following the Molson Meeting, approved by the Court and (iv) communicated to holders of Molson Shares and, in the case of an amendment, modification or supplement of section 2.2(i) other than as contemplated by section 6.1(a), holders of Molson Options, in each case, if and as required by the Court.
(c)
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may be proposed by Molson at any time prior to the Molson Meeting (provided that Coors shall have consented thereto) with or without any other prior notice or communication, and if so proposed and accepted by the Persons voting at the Molson Meeting (other than as may be required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of Arrangement for all purposes.
(d)
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement that is approved by the Court following the Molson Meeting shall be effective only if (i) it is consented to by each of Molson and Coors and (ii) if required by the Court, it is consented to by holders of the Molson Shares and, in the case of an amendment, modification or supplement on section 2.2(i) other than as contemplated by section 6.1(a), holders of Molson Options, in each case, voting in the manner directed by the Court.

2.2
The Restricted Shares, subject to the prior rights of any Preferred Shares which by their terms rank senior to the Restricted Shares, shall be entitled to a preference over the Exchangeable Shares and any other share ranking junior to the Restricted Shares with respect to the payment of dividends. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no class of shares of the Corporation other than the Class D Preferred Shares will rank in priority to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the entitlement to dividends pursuant to Article 3 hereof.
3.1
A holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each Coors Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each Corresponding Exchangeable Share:
(a)
in the case of a cash dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, in an amount in cash for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share in U.S. dollars, or the Canadian Dollar Equivalent thereof on the Coors Dividend Declaration Date, in each case, corresponding to the cash dividend declared on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be;
(b)
in the case of a stock dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock to be paid in Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B
Common Stock, by the issue or transfer by the Corporation of such number of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share as is equal to the number of shares of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock to be paid on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, unless in lieu of such stock dividend the Corporation elects to effect a corresponding and contemporaneous and economically equivalent (as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with section 3.5 hereof) subdivision of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares; or
(c)
in the case of a dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock in property other than cash or Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, in such type and amount of property for each Corresponding Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically equivalent to (to be determined by the Board of Directors as contemplated by section 3.6 hereof) the type and amount of property declared as a dividend on each share of Coors Class A Common Stock or share of Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be.
Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or property of the Corporation properly applicable to the payment of dividends, or out of authorized but unissued shares of the Corporation, as applicable. The holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled to any dividends other than or in excess of the dividends referred to in this section 3.1.
3.2
The Corporation covenants that it will pay additional amounts with respect to any dividends paid to a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares in the event that any withholding taxes other than those required or entitled to be withheld pursuant to the ITA or any provincial tax laws ("
non-Canadian withholding taxes
") are imposed, directly or indirectly, in respect of such dividends. Such additional amounts shall be determined such that, on an after-tax basis, the Canadian resident holder has received the same amount that it would have received if no non-Canadian withholding taxes had been imposed, taking into account any increased (x) gross income tax imposed directly on such holder by the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes, (y) non-Canadian withholding tax and (z) Canadian income tax, in each case, in respect of such additional amounts after any reductions of income, credits or deductions available to such holder arising as a result of such non-Canadian withholding taxes or any payments under this section 3.2 (and only to the extent a net increase in tax is reasonably demonstrated by such holder). If gross income tax in the jurisdiction imposing such non-Canadian withholding taxes is paid directly by a Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares with respect to dividends on such Exchangeable Shares or any payment made under this section 3.2, the Corporation shall make a tax reimbursement payment to the Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares for any such taxes (whether such taxes are actually withheld, paid by reason of notice received from a taxing authority or otherwise) not covered by additional amounts described above (and computed by treating the tax reimbursement payment for purposes of this section as an additional amount to which this section applies). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such additional amounts and tax reimbursement payments will not apply to the extent non-Canadian withholding taxes are imposed at a rate in excess of the withholding tax rate applicable to payments of dividends to individuals under the income tax treaty between the United States and Canada, or any successor treaty. Without limiting a Canadian resident holder's obligation to reasonably demonstrate a net increase in taxes imposed as described above, nothing contained herein shall require any Canadian resident holder of the Exchangeable Shares to disclose any confidential or propriety information (including, without limitation, its tax return). In no event shall anything in this section 3.2 require any Canadian resident holder of Exchangeable Shares to arrange its tax affairs in any particular manner.
3.3
Cheques of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation shall be issued in respect of any cash dividends contemplated by section 3.1(a) hereof and the sending
of such a cheque to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash dividend represented thereby unless the cheque is not paid on presentation. Certificates registered in the name of the registered holder of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares shall be issued or transferred in respect of any stock dividends contemplated by section 3.1(b) hereof and the sending of such a certificate to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in respect of any dividends contemplated by section 3.1(c) hereof shall be issued, distributed or transferred by the Corporation in such manner as it shall determine and the issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by the Corporation to each holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the dividend represented thereby. The amount of any such cheque, the number of shares issued on any such stock dividend or the amount of any such property will be net of any amount withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. No holder of a Corresponding Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to recover by action or other legal process against the Corporation any dividend that is represented by a cheque that has not been duly presented to the Corporation's bankers for payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from the date on which such dividend was payable.
3.4
The record date for the determination of the holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares entitled to receive payment of, and the payment date for, any dividend declared on the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares under section 3.1 hereof shall be the same dates as the record date and payment date, respectively, for the dividend declared on the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, as the case may be.
3.5
If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares under section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in full on all of the Corresponding Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by the Board of Directors on which the Corporation shall have sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of such dividends.
3.6
For the purposes of section 3.1 hereof, the Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith and in its sole discretion with assistance of such reputable and qualified independent financial advisors and/or other experts as the Board of Directors may require, economic equivalence and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation and its shareholders. In making each such determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other factors determined by the Board of Directors to be relevant, be considered by the Board of Directors:
(a)
in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock previously outstanding;
(b)
in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant and the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share;
(c)
in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property (including without limitation any shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, any rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in section 3.6(b) above, any evidences of indebtedness of Coors or any assets of Coors) the relationship between the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such property to be issued or distributed with
respect to each outstanding Class A Share or Class B Share and the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share;
(d)
in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a greater number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or the reduction, combination or consolidation or change of the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock into a lesser number of Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock or any amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock, the effect thereof upon the then outstanding Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock; and
(e)
in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to beneficial owners of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ from the general taxation consequences to such beneficial owners determined as if they owned Coors Class A Common Stock or Coors Class B Common Stock at the relevant time as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing marginal taxation rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares).
4.1
So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are outstanding, the Corporation shall not at any time without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as specified in section 10.2 of these share provisions:
(a)
pay any dividends on the Restricted Shares, Preferred Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends, other than stock dividends payable in Restricted Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be;
(b)
redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Restricted Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends;
(c)
redeem or purchase any other shares of the Corporation ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or
(d)
issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of the Corporation ranking equally with, or superior to with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution, the Exchangeable Shares other than by way of stock dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares.
The restrictions in sections 4.1(a), (b), (c) and (d) above shall not apply if all dividends on such class of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding to dividends declared and paid to date on the Corresponding Coors Common Stock shall have been declared and paid on such class of Exchangeable Shares.
5.1
In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or any other distribution of the assets of the Corporation among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, subject to Callco's exercise of the Liquidation Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of the Corporation in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date (the "
Liquidation Date
") of such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any distribution of any part of the assets of the Corporation among the holders of the Restricted Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the "
Liquidation Amount
") equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder one Corresponding Coors Share, and (ii) an amount equal to all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Liquidation Date.
5.2
On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject to the exercise by Callco of the Liquidation Call Right, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the
Corporation by notice to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivering to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of the Corporation, certificates representing Corresponding Coors Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and a cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in respect of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof). On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount (which, for greater certainty, shall be net of any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof), the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.
5.3
After the Corporation has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share pursuant to section 5.1 of these share provisions, such holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of the Corporation.
5.4
Callco shall have the overriding right (the "
Liquidation Call Right
"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to section 5.1 of these share provisions to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an Affiliate of Coors) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco of an amount per share (the "
Liquidation Call Purchase Price
") equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered for each such Exchangeable Share to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock, and (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date on payment by Callco to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount to the holders of such shares so purchased by Callco.
5.5
To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares and the Corporation of Callco's intention to exercise such right at
least 60 days before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in the case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the Liquidation Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price.
5.6
For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, Callco shall deposit with, or cause to be delivered to, the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price for all holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date, each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) will be limited to receiving, without interest, such holder's proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents, instruments and payments (including, without limitation, any applicable Stamp Taxes) as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Article 13 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Liquidation Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by the Corporation in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation pursuant to section 5.2 hereof.
6.1
A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any time, subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of this Article 6, to require the Corporation to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date (the "
Retraction Price
"), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to such holder one Corresponding Coors Share for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the holder, and (ii) on the designated payment date therefor, the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on any such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Retraction Date. To effect such redemption, the
holder shall present and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares the certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement (the "
Retraction Request
") in the form of Schedule A hereto or in such other form as may be acceptable to the Corporation:
(a)
specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or certificates (the "
Retracted Shares
") redeemed by the Corporation;
(b)
stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have the Corporation redeem the Retracted Shares (the "
Retraction Date
"), provided that the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation and further provided that, in the event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall be deemed to be the 15th Business Day after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by the Corporation; and
(c)
acknowledging the overriding right (the "
Retraction Call Right
") of Callco to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms and conditions set out in section 6.3 below,
provided however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Offer as defined in section 2.8 of the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement, the Corporation will use its commercially reasonable efforts, expeditiously and in good faith to put in place procedures or to cause the Transfer Agent to put in place procedures to ensure that, if holders of Corresponding Exchangeable Shares are required to retract such Corresponding Exchangeable Shares to participate in the Offer, that any such retraction shall be conditional upon and shall only be effective if the Corresponding Coors Common Stock tendered or deposited under such Offer is taken up.
6.2
Subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent in the manner specified in section 6.1 hereof of a certificate or certificates representing the number of Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such holder the total Retraction Price less any amount withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by Callco pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the expense of the Corporation.
6.3
Upon receipt by the Corporation of a Retraction Request, the Corporation shall immediately notify Callco thereof and shall provide to Callco a copy of the Retraction Request. In order to exercise the Retraction Call Right, Callco must notify the Corporation of its determination to do so (the "
Callco Call Notice
") within five Business Days of notification to Callco by the Corporation of the receipt by the Corporation of the Retraction Request. If Callco does not so notify the Corporation within such five Business Day period, the Corporation will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that Callco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco
delivers the Callco Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, the Corporation shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco shall purchase from such holder and such holder shall sell to Callco on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares for a purchase price (the "
Purchase Price
") per share equal to the sum of (i) the Retraction Price per share, plus (ii) on the designated payment date therefor, to the extent not paid by the Corporation on the designated payment date therefor, any Dividend Amount in respect of the Retracted Shares. To the extent that Callco pays the Dividend Amount in respect of the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall no longer be obligated to pay any declared and unpaid dividends on such Retracted Shares. Provided that Callco has complied with section 6.4, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date and, for greater certainty, no redemption by the Corporation of such Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event that Callco does not deliver a Callco Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the Corporation shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 6.
6.4
The Corporation or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of the Corporation for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified in the holder's Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as the holder may request, and, if applicable and on or before the payment date therefor, a cheque payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation or Callco, as applicable, representing the aggregate declared and unpaid dividends or the aggregate Dividend Amount, as the case may be, in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof, and such delivery of such certificates and cheques on behalf of the Corporation or by Callco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that the same is represented by such share certificates and cheques (plus any tax deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority).
6.5
On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may be, unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in section 6.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by the Corporation or purchased by Callco shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to it.
6.6
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6, the Corporation shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law. If the Corporation believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Corporation shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder and the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by the Corporation. In any case in which the redemption by the Corporation of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the Corporation shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with section 6.2 of these share provisions on a pro rata basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense of the Corporation, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to section 6.2 hereof. Provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in section 6.7, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by the Corporation pursuant to section 6.2 of these share provisions as a result of solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to require Coors to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, provided that Callco has not exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, on payment by Coors to such holder of the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.
6.7
A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given by the holder to the Corporation before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco shall be deemed to have been revoked.
7.1
Subject to applicable law, and provided Callco has not exercised the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall on the Redemption Date redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to the sum of, (i) the Current Market Price of a Corresponding Coors Share on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (the "
Redemption Price
"), which shall be satisfied in full by the Corporation delivering or causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one Corresponding Coors Share for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder, together with (ii) the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date.
7.2
In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under this Article 7, the Corporation shall, at least 60 days before the Redemption Date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by the Corporation or the purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In any such case, such notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right.
7.3
On or after the Redemption Date and subject to the exercise by Callco of the Redemption Call Right, the Corporation shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares to be redeemed, the Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share, together with the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the Redemption Date, upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent and the Corporation may reasonably require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares, together with payment of such dividends, shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the register of the Corporation or by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of the Corporation or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation in such notice, on behalf of the Corporation of certificates representing Corresponding Coors Common Stock (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and, if applicable, a cheque of the Corporation payable at par at any branch of the bankers of the Corporation in payment of any such dividends, in each case, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. On and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price and any such dividends, unless payment of the total Redemption Price and any such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price and any such dividends have been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. The Corporation shall have the right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the total Redemption Price for and the full amount of such dividends on the Exchangeable Shares (except as otherwise provided in this section 7.3) so called for redemption, or of such of the said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Upon the later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price and such dividends for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Redemption Price (which, for greater certainty, shall be net of any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof) and the full amount of such dividends, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.
7.4
Callco shall have the overriding right (the "
Redemption Call Right
"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the Exchangeable Shares by the Corporation pursuant to section 7.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is Coors or an Affiliate of Coors) on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco to each holder of an amount per Exchangeable Share (the "
Redemption Call Purchase Price
") equal to the sum of (i) the Current Market Price of a share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco causing to be delivered for each such Exchangeable Share
to such holder one share of Corresponding Coors Common Stock, and (ii) any Dividend Amount. In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right by Callco, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to Callco on the Redemption Date, on payment by Callco to the holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share, and the Corporation shall have no obligation to redeem, or to pay any Dividend Amount in respect of such shares so purchased by Callco.
7.5
To exercise the Redemption Call Right, Callco must notify the Transfer Agent and the Corporation of Callco's intention to exercise such right at least 60 days before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date Callco will purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase Price.
7.6
For the purposes of completing the purchase of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, Callco shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date, certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Corresponding Coors Common Stock deliverable by Callco and a cheque or cheques of Callco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, if any, in payment of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Redemption Date, each holder of Exchangeable Shares (other than Coors and its Affiliates) shall cease to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, and the rights of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holder's proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by Callco upon presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA, the Articles and by-laws of the Corporation and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the Corresponding Coors Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or cheques of Coors payable at par at any branch of the bankers of Callco in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld on account of tax pursuant to Article 13 hereof. For greater certainty, if Callco does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in the manner described above, on the Redemption Date the holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Redemption Price otherwise payable by the Corporation pursuant to section 7.3 hereof.
8.1
Subject to applicable law and any applicable rules and regulations of the TSX, the Corporation may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares.
9.1
Except as required by applicable law and by Article 10 hereof, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation or to vote at any such meeting. The holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall, however, be entitled to notice of meetings of the shareholders called for the purpose of authorizing the dissolution of the Corporation or the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the property of the Corporation other than in the ordinary course of business of the Corporation.
10.1
The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares may be added to, changed or removed but only with the approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given as hereinafter specified, and, as required, the approval of the TSX.
10.2
Any approval given by the holders of a class of the Exchangeable Shares to add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition attaching to such class of the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the approval or consent of the holders of a class of the Exchangeable Shares or of the holders of all Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given if it shall have been given in accordance with applicable law subject to a minimum requirement that such approval be evidenced by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at a meeting of (i) holders of such class of Exchangeable Shares or (ii) holders of all Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, duly called and held at which the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares eligible to vote as such meeting at that time are present or represented by proxy; provided that if at any such meeting the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares eligible to vote at such meeting at that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half hour after the time appointed for such meeting, then the meeting shall be adjourned to such date not less than five days thereafter and to such time and place as may be designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such adjourned meeting the holders of Exchangeable Shares eligible to vote at such meeting present or represented by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of such class of the Exchangeable Shares or of the holders of all Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be.
11.1
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable Shares (other than those owned by Coors and its Affiliates) are outstanding, Coors will not without the prior approval of the Corporation and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions:
(a)
issue or distribute Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock) to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock by way of stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire
Corresponding Coors Common Stock) to holders of Corresponding Coors Common Stock who exercise an option to receive dividends in Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock) in lieu of receiving cash dividends;
(b)
issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or to purchase Corresponding Coors Common Stock (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock); or
(c)
issue or distribute to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock:
(i)
shares or securities of Coors of any class other than Corresponding Coors Common Stock (other than shares convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying rights to acquire Corresponding Coors Common Stock);
(ii)
rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in section 11.1(b) above;
(iii)
evidences of indebtedness of Coors; or
(iv)
assets of Coors,
unless the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such rights, options, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other assets is issued or distributed simultaneously to holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares.
11.2
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement further provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable Shares (other than those owned by Coors and its Affiliates) are outstanding, Coors will not without the prior approval of the Corporation and the prior approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions:
(a)
subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock into a greater number of Corresponding Coors Common Stock;
(b)
reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then outstanding Corresponding Coors Common Stock into a lesser number of Corresponding Coors Common Stock; or
(c)
reclassify or otherwise change the Corresponding Coors Common Stock or effect an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the Corresponding Coors Common Stock,
unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall simultaneously be made to, or in, the rights of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares. The Exchangeable Share Support Agreement further provides, in part, that the aforesaid provisions of the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement shall not be changed without the approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions.
11.3
If Coors, at any time after the date hereof, consummates any transaction (whether by way of reconstruction, reorganization, consolidation, arrangement, merger, transfer, sale, lease or otherwise) whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and assets would become property of any other Person or, in the case of a merger, of the continuing corporation or other equity resulting therefrom (such other person or continuing corporation (or, in the event of a merger, amalgamation or similar transaction pursuant to which holders of shares in the capital of Coors are entitled to receive shares or other ownership interest in the capital of any corporation or other legal entity other than such other person or continuing corporation, then such corporation or other legal entity in which holders of shares in the capital of Coors are entitled to receive an interest) is herein called the "
Coors Successor
") then, provided that the Coors Successor is bound,
or has agreed to be bound, by the provisions of the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement and Support Agreement and to assume the obligations of Coors thereunder to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors, all references in these Share Provisions to Coors Restricted Shares shall be deemed to be references to the shares of the Coors Successor which has assumed the obligations of Coors and all references to Coors shall be to Coors Successor, without amendment to these Share Provisions or any further action whatsoever. For greater certainty, if a transaction described in this section 11.3 results in holders of Exchangeable Shares being entitled to exchange their Exchangeable Shares for shares of a Coors Successor in a different ratio than that set out in these share provisions, then these share provisions shall be deemed to be amended to refer to such different ratio(s).
12.1
The Corporation will take all such actions and do all such things as shall be necessary or advisable to perform and comply with and to ensure performance and compliance by Coors and the Corporation with all provisions of the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement applicable to Coors and the Corporation, respectively, in accordance with the terms thereof including, without limitation, taking all such actions and doing all such things as shall be necessary or advisable to enforce to the fullest extent possible for the direct benefit of the Corporation all rights and benefits in favour of the Corporation under or pursuant to such agreement.
12.2
The Corporation shall not propose, agree to or otherwise give effect to any amendment to, or waiver or forgiveness of its rights or obligations under, the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement without the approval of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with section 10.2 of these share provisions other than such amendments, waivers and/or forgiveness as may be necessary or advisable for the purposes of:
(a)
adding to the covenants of the other parties to such agreement for the protection of the Corporation or the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares thereunder;
(b)
making such provisions or modifications not inconsistent with such agreement as may be necessary or desirable with respect to matters or questions arising thereunder which, in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors, it may be expedient to make, provided that the Board of Directors shall be of the good faith opinion, after consultation with counsel, that such provisions and modifications will not be prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares; or
(c)
making such changes in or corrections to such agreement which, on the advice of counsel to the Corporation, are required for the purpose of curing or correcting any ambiguity or defect or inconsistent provision or clerical omission or mistake or manifest error contained therein, provided that the Board of Directors shall be of the good faith opinion, after consultation with counsel, that such changes or corrections will not be prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the affected class of Exchangeable Shares.
13.1
The certificates evidencing the Exchangeable Shares shall contain or have affixed thereto a legend in form and on terms approved by the Board of Directors, with respect to the Exchangeable Share Support Agreement, the provisions of the Liquidation Call Right, Retraction Call Right and the Redemption Call Right, the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement (including the provisions with respect to the voting rights, exchange right and automatic exchange thereunder).
13.2
Each holder of an Exchangeable Share, whether of record or beneficial, by virtue of becoming and being such a holder shall be deemed to acknowledge each of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right and the Redemption Call Right, in each case, in favour of Callco, and the overriding nature thereof in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation or the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and to be bound thereby in favour of Callco as therein provided.
13.3
The Corporation, Coors, Callco and the Transfer Agent (in each case, the "
Payer
") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Exchangeable Shares ("
Exchangeable Payee
") such amounts as the Payer is, (i) required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case, as amended or succeeded or, (ii) entitled to withhold under section 116 of the ITA or any analogous provision of provincial laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to Exchangeable Payee in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to an Exchangeable Payee exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the Exchangeable Payee, the Payer is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to the Payer to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement or entitlement and the Payer shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale, provided however that nothing in this section 13.3 shall reduce Exchangeco's obligations under section 6.1 (h) of the Combination Agreement and section 3.2 hereof. References in this section to the ITA are to the ITA as amended from time to time.
13.4
The Corporation shall elect under section 191.2 of the ITA (as of the Effective Date and any modifications of such provision which are consistent with the general principle thereof) in respect of each of the Class A Exchangeable Shares and the Class B Exchangeable Shares.
13.5
The specified amount for purposes of subsection 191(4) of the ITA (as of the Effective Date and any modifications of such provision which are consistent with the general principle thereof) is $     -     in respect of the Class A Exchangeable Shares and $     -     in respect of the Class B Exchangeable Shares.
14.1

The Corporation shall make all arrangements with the Transfer Agent necessary or desirable to give effect to this section 16.4.

Subject to and in compliance with the provisions of this Article 18, each holder of Class A Exchangeable Shares may, at any time and from time to time, at such holder's election, convert any or all outstanding Class A Exchangeable Shares held by such holder into Class B Exchangeable Shares (any such conversion, a "
Conversion
") pursuant to the provisions of this section 18.1. In order to effect a Conversion, a holder of Class A Exchangeable Shares must
deliver at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by the Corporation by notice to the holders of the Class A Exchangeable Shares (i) a written notice of such holder's election to convert (a "
Notice of Conversion
") Class A Exchangeable Shares specifying the number of shares to be converted and (ii) the certificate or certificates representing such shares. Such Notice of Conversion, once delivered to the Transfer Agent, shall be irrevocable. As promptly as practicable after receipt by the Transfer Agent of such Notice of Conversion and such certificate or certificates, the Transfer Agent shall on behalf of the Corporation issue and shall deliver to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of Class B Exchangeable Shares issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Article 18. In the event of a Conversion of a certificate or certificates in part, the Transfer Agent shall also issue on behalf of the Corporation to such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of Class A Exchangeable Shares not being so converted. A Conversion shall be deemed to have been consummated immediately prior to the end of the Business Day the Transfer Agent receives the Notice of Conversion of the holder of Class A Exchangeable Shares electing to make such Conversion (the "
Conversion Date
"), or if the Conversion Date is not a Business Day, then the next Business Day, and as of such date such holder shall be deemed to be a holder of record of the number of Class B Exchangeable Shares issuable upon such Conversion in accordance with this Article 18 notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation may then be closed or that a certificate or certificates representing such Class B Exchangeable Shares shall not then actually be issued or delivered to such holder.
18.2
Upon a Conversion, the holder of Class A Exchangeable Shares being converted shall receive a number of Class B Exchangeable Shares equal to the product of the number of Class A Exchangeable Shares being converted and the Conversion Ratio then in effect. The Conversion Ratio shall initially be one (1), and shall in all events be equitably adjusted in the event of any recapitalization of the Corporation by means of a stock dividend on, or a stock split or combination of, outstanding Class A Exchangeable Shares or Class B Exchangeable Shares, or in the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Corporation with another corporation.
18.3
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the delivery of any Class B Exchangeable Shares that the Transfer Agent is obligated to deliver on behalf of the Corporation pursuant to any Conversion, the Transfer Agent and the Corporation shall comply with all applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations which require action to be taken by the Transfer Agent and the Corporation in connection with such Conversion.

        Section 8.01.
    Nature of Restrictions.
    No beneficial interests in any Trust Shares, whether or not represented by Certificates issued pursuant to this Agreement, may be Transferred, except that (i) a Beneficiary may transfer all or a portion of its beneficial interest in Trust Shares in such Beneficiary's Beneficiary Account to (A) the Permitted Family Transferees of such Beneficiary (in which event, as a condition to such transfer, if the Transferor was a Molson Family Group Beneficiary, the Transferor shall cause the Transferee thereupon to become a signatory hereto and the Transferee will thereupon become a Molson Family Group Beneficiary and if the Transferor was a Coors Family Group Beneficiary, the Transferor shall cause the Transferee thereupon to become signatory hereto and the Transferee will thereupon become a Coors Family Group Beneficiary) or (B) any other Beneficiary hereunder (collectively, the "Permitted Transferees"), subject to the further condition that the Trust Shares subject to such Transfer shall remain in trust pursuant to this Agreement and no such Transfer shall be valid unless the transferee consents in writing to be bound as a Beneficiary hereunder; (ii) a Beneficiary may make a disposition in accordance with Section 8.02 hereof; and (iii) a transfer, sale or issuance of securities in the Beneficiary or any other Person with a direct or indirect equity interest in
such Beneficiary may be effected so long as, after giving effect thereto, the Beneficiary remains a member of the Molson Family Group or Coors Family Group, as the case may be.
        Section 8.02.
    Third Party Transfers.
    A Beneficiary may Transfer (a) its beneficial interest in any Trust Shares to one or more third party transferees other than a Permitted Transferee (each, a "Third Party Transferee") provided that such Transfer constitutes a Permitted Encumbrance or a Permitted Hedge and/or (b) its beneficial interest in Trust Shares that are Company Shares to a Third Party Transferee provided that prior to such Transfer such Company Shares are converted as permitted pursuant to Article Sixth of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation so that the Third Party Transferee receives only shares of Class B Common Stock. Any such conversion and Transfer described in clause (b) shall be effected by the transferring Beneficiary's Beneficiary Representative causing the Trustee, in accordance with Section 3.05(b), to take such actions as are required by such section to effect such conversion and Transfer and to release such Trust Shares (and the shares of Class B Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof) from the Trust created hereby, whereupon such shares shall no longer be subject to this Agreement. Following any such conversion and Transfer described in clause (b), this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to all other Trust Shares not subject to such Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including this Section 8.02), each Molson Family Group Beneficiary agrees that it shall not be permitted to make a Transfer of its beneficial interests in Trust Shares under this Section 8.02 nor convert any Company Shares to Class B Common Stock if, giving effect to such Transfer or the requisite conversion, the Company Shares remaining subject to this Agreement, together with any Class A Exchangeable Shares (and associated rights) subject to the Canadian Voting Trust Agreement, would constitute in the aggregate less than 50.1% of the aggregate voting power of all then-outstanding Company Shares and Class A Exchangeable Shares (and associated rights) unless, at any time prior to such Transfer or conversion, the aggregate number of Company Shares and Class A Exchangeable Shares of the Coors Family Group Beneficiaries deposited under this Agreement and/or the Canadian Voting Trust Agreement is less than the number (without duplication, as adjusted by any stock split, consolidation, reorganization, merger, amalgamation, reclassification, recapitalization or similar transactions) of Company Shares initially deposited by the Coors Trust on the date hereof under this Agreement as a result of one or more Transfers (and associated conversion into Class B Common Stock) of Company Shares to a Third Party Transferee.
        Section 8.03.
    Agreement Not to Cause Conversion Right.
    The Beneficiaries agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no Beneficiary shall be permitted to make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any beneficial interest in any Trust Shares if, as a result thereof, any shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company or Class B Exchangeable Shares shall become convertible into Company Shares or Class A Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the provisions of Article Fifth of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of Article 16 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, respectively, (ii) in no event shall any Transfer be made pursuant to Section 8.02 if such Transfer would constitute or require an "Exclusionary Offer" (as defined in Article Fifth of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of Article 16.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions), (iii) unless otherwise expressly instructed in writing unanimously by each of the Beneficiary Representatives in connection with the occurrence of an "Exclusionary Offer" (as defined in Article Fifth of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or in Article 16.1 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions), the Trustee is hereby specifically empowered and directed to deliver any and all certificates and other documents pursuant to such Article Fifth or Article 16 as may be necessary or advisable to prevent the Class B Common Stock or Class B Exchangeable Shares from becoming convertible into Company Shares or Class A Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to such Article Fifth or Article 16 and (iv) no Beneficiary shall be permitted to take any actions contrary to any certificate that has been delivered to the Company pursuant to paragraph (i) of Article Fifth of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (a "Blocking Certificate") or that would cause any Blocking Certificate to be untrue or invalid. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Trustee
acknowledges and advises the Beneficiaries that it is delivering to the Company concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement a Blocking Certificate, and the Trustee further agrees not to rescind or withdraw such Blocking Certificate without the prior written consent of each Beneficiary Representative. If necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the Blocking Certificate following a permitted Transfer hereunder, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company an additional or replacement Blocking Certificate.
        Section 8.04.
    Legend.
    Each Beneficiary agrees that all Certificates now held or hereafter obtained by him shall have endorsed upon them a legend substantially in the form set forth in Section 3.07.

    Relationships Created Hereunder.
    The trust created by this Agreement is not intended to be, and shall not be treated as, a general partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, corporation or joint stock company or association. The relationship of the Beneficiaries to the Trustee shall be solely that of Beneficiaries of the trust created by this Agreement and their rights shall be limited to those conferred upon them by this Agreement.
        Section 9.02.
    Deposit of Stock Certificates.

        Section 9.03.
    Amendments.
    This Agreement may be amended by an instrument or instruments in writing executed by the Trustee, the Coors Beneficiary Representative and the Molson Beneficiary Representative (neither of which need be Continuing Representatives at the time of such action); provided that the Trustee may, without the consent of any Beneficiary, amend this Agreement (including any exhibit hereto) in order to (i) reflect the admission in accordance with the terms of this Agreement of additional persons to the Agreement as Beneficiaries so long as such persons have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement or (ii) update any exhibit hereto to reflect any changes in any Beneficiary's name, address or number of Trust Shares set forth thereon.

        Section 9.09.
    Severability.
    If in any judicial proceedings a court shall refuse to enforce any provision of this Agreement, then such unenforceable provision shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining provisions to be enforced.

It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of or under or relates to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or under or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (d) hereby further and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
