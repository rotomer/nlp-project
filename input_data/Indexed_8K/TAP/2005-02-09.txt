Exhibit 99.1 MOLSON COORS REPORTS ADOLPH COORS COMPANY 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS GOLDEN, Colo., Feb. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today announced the most recent financial results for Adolph Coors Company, reporting higher consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full-year 2004. For the 13-week fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, 2004, the company reported net sales of $1.1 billion, up 10.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2003. Fourth quarter 2004 sales volume increased 4.7 percent from the fourth quarter 2003. Fourth quarter operating income of $90.9 million and net income of $55.7 million increased 37.5 percent and 54.4 percent, respectively, from a year ago. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.45, up 48.0 percent from a year earlier. Earnings for fourth quarter 2004 benefited from solid beer pricing and volume growth in the company's Americas and Europe segments, along with one-time gains on asset sales totaling $19.2 million pretax, a lower effective tax rate, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These results do not include Molson Inc. financial results for the quarter ended December 2004, which were released separately. For the 52-week fiscal year ended Dec. 26, 2004, Adolph Coors Company achieved consolidated net sales of $4.3 billion, a 7.6 percent increase from 2003. Reported sales volume totaled 32,703,000 U.S. barrels, or 38,376,000 hectoliters, in 2004, a 0.1 percent decrease from 2003. Net income for the full year was $196.7 million, a 12.6 percent increase compared to full year 2003, and earnings per share were $5.19, up 8.8 percent from the prior year. Leo Kiely, chief executive officer, said, "Overall, Adolph Coors Company finished 2004 with good financial results in a very competitive industry environment. In the U.S., despite very soft industry demand, our sales to retail increased in the fourth quarter, partially driven by the comparison to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2003, when we faced U.S. supply-chain challenges. Our volume trends also benefited from the introduction of Aspen Edge earlier this year and strong growth from our Blue Moon and Zima XXX brands in the fourth quarter. In addition, continued progress on productivity initiatives in our U.S. operations enabled us to manage cost pressures, which were particularly challenging in the areas of energy and packaging materials. In Canada, our Coors Light business continued to deliver strong profit growth. "Our U.K. business achieved solid growth in volume, net sales and earnings for the fourth quarter, despite higher distribution costs and continued declines in sales of flavored alcohol beverages and non-owned beverage brands. Profit growth in our Europe segment was driven by a gain on the sale of our Cape Hill brewery property, strong volume performance from Carling and Grolsch, improved pricing in both the on- and off-trade channels, and favorable foreign exchange rates. For the full year, we gained market share in the U.K. in both the on-trade and off-trade channels. "On a company-wide basis in the fourth quarter, we repaid about $127 million of debt, resulting in full-year debt repayments of $382 million. We have now repaid $862 million of debt in the past three years, essentially all of our short-term debt and more than half of the debt related to our 2002 CBL acquisition. "Looking ahead, we will be simultaneously focused on improving the fundamentals of our U.S. and U.K. businesses and on working with our new colleagues from Molson to maximize the value opportunities presented by the Molson Coors merger, which closed earlier today."
Americas Segment Results In the fourth quarter 2004, net sales in the Americas segment increased 9.0 percent from the fourth quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter sales volume for the segment was up 4.2 percent from a year earlier, and wholesaler sales to retail increased 1.0 percent. U.S. sales volume to wholesalers also increased 4.2 percent, while wholesaler sales to retail increased 0.8 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Sales volume to wholesalers exceeded sales to retail because the company's distributors started the fourth quarter of 2003 with high beer inventories in anticipation of our supply-chain systems changeover that quarter. Americas segment pretax earnings, up 74.6 percent from a year earlier, partially benefited by one-time real estate sales of $11.7 million pretax in the quarter. For the full year 2004, Americas segment net sales increased 3.0 percent from a year earlier. Americas segment sales volume for 2004 decreased 0.7 percent compared to the prior year, while sales to retail decreased 0.3 percent. U.S. sales volume and sales to retail decreased 0.8 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, compared to full year 2003. Pretax income for the full year 2004 increased 17.8 percent from 2003. The company's Coors Light business in Canada achieved pretax earnings of $60.7 million for full year 2004, up 27.7 percent from 2003. Fourth quarter income of $15.7 million was 25.0 percent higher than a year ago, driven by mid-single-digit volume growth in a tough market, improved beer pricing, and a 7.3 percent appreciation in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Europe Segment Results In the fourth quarter 2004, the Europe segment achieved an 11.7 percent increase in net sales from the fourth quarter of 2003. Sales volume increased 5.5 percent versus a year ago, driven by the Carling brand growing at a high-single-digit rate and Grolsch volume growing at a strong-double-digit rate during the quarter. Europe segment 2004 fourth quarter pretax income increased to $60.7 million, up 25.2 percent from the prior year, driven by solid volume growth, a one-time asset sale of $7.5 million pretax (reported as a special credit on the company's income statement) and 9.3 percent appreciation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. For the full year 2004, Europe segment net sales increased 14.7 percent and sales volume increased 1.3 percent compared to full year 2003. Pretax earnings for the segment in 2004 were $158.7 million, a 15.2 percent increase from the prior year. Molson Coors Brewing Company will conduct a conference call with financial analysts and investors at noon Eastern Time today to discuss the company's year-end and fourth quarter results. A live webcast of the conference call will be accessible via the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com.

EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes. The Corporation uses EBIT to evaluate the financial and operating performance of its business units and segments. The Corporation believes that EBIT is a useful indicator of profitability of its business segments. EBIT is not intended as an alternative measure of net earnings as determined in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. Because EBIT may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation in the Corporation's financial statements may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The reconciliation of net earnings as determined in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles to EBIT is provided in the table on page one. In a special shareholder meeting held on January 28, 2005, Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders approved the proposed merger with Adolph Coors Company ("Coors"). The proposed merger also received the approval of Coors stockholders at a special meeting on February 1, 2005 and the transaction was also approved by the Quebec Superior Court on February 2, 2005. The closing of the transaction is planned for February 9, 2005. The Molson Coors stock is expected to start trading on the NYSE and the exchangeable shares of Molson Coors Canada Inc. on the TSX on February 9, 2005. Registered Molson shareholders at the close of business on the day preceding the closing will be entitled to receive a $5.44 special dividend as part of the approved transaction. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, net sales revenue was virtually flat at $623.2 million compared to $623.3 million for the same period last year, reflecting lower net sales in Brazil mainly due to lower volumes offset by higher net sales in Canada. Consolidated brewing volume decreased by 7.5% to 5.37 million hectolitres versus 5.82 million hectolitres for the same period last year with volume down by 2.9% and 11.1% in Canada and Brazil, respectively. In the quarter, the Corporation recorded a rationalization provision for the Brazilian operation of $36.1 million relating primarily to the previously announced closure of the Queimados brewery and organizational right-sizing including sales centres. In addition, the Corporation recorded $8.0 million of costs related to the proposed merger between Molson and Coors. In aggregate, these charges totaled $44.1 million ($34.2 million net of tax and minority interest). The net earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2004 were $17.7 million and net earnings per share were $0.14 compared to $43.6 million of net earnings and $0.34 earnings per share for the same period last year. Excluding the current quarter's merger related costs and provisions for rationalization as well as the $16.0 million non-cash increase in future income tax liabilities in the same quarter last year, net earnings for the period were $51.9 million or a 12.9% decrease from $59.6 million when compared to last year. Net earnings per share decreased 12.8% to $0.41 per share compared to $0.47 per share last year on the same basis. The net loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 was $31.9 million compared to net earnings of $194.8 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2003. Excluding the impairment charge and the merger related costs in the current year, the non-cash increase in future income tax liabilities last year and the provisions for rationalization costs in both years, net earnings for the nine-month period were $183.5 million or a 23.8% decrease from $240.7 million for the same period last year. Net earnings per share decreased 24.2% to $1.44 per share compared to $1.90 per share last year on the same basis. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2004, EBIT in Canada decreased 5.2% to $110.0 million, excluding the merger related costs of $8.0 million, and reflects increased selling and pension costs and the continued strengthening of the value segment in certain regional markets. Canada's EBIT for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 declined 2.7%, excluding the merger related costs in the current quarter and provisions for rationalization in both years. Brazil's EBIT year-to-date was negatively impacted by lower volumes as well as higher marketing and sales centre expenditures while in the quarter, the increased sales centre expenses were offset by lower marketing and other costs when compared to last year. -2-
Net interest expense for the quarter was $23.6 million which was $1.3 million higher than the prior year reflecting higher debt and obligations in Brazil partially offset by an overall decrease in average debt and related interest expense in Canada. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, net interest expense was $66.5 million or $3.5 million lower than the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2004 was 40.7% compared to 37.1% last year reflecting the mix of earnings and no tax recovery being recorded on the Brazil losses. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 on net earnings was 42.9% compared to 33.7% last year. The effective tax rate for both the three and nine month periods ending December 31, 2004 and 2003 exclude the impairment charge, merger related costs, provisions for rationalization and the non-cash income tax expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 relating to the repeal of previously enacted future income tax rate reductions in Ontario. REVIEW OF OPERATIONS Molson's business operations consist of the ownership of 100% of Molson Canada; 80% of Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil, S.A. ("Kaiser"); 49.9% of Coors Canada (results proportionately consolidated) and a 50.1% interest in Molson USA, which markets and distributes the Molson brands in the United States (results also proportionately consolidated). NET SALES REVENUE Net sales revenue in the quarter was virtually flat at $623.2 million reflecting lower volumes in Brazil partially offset by favourable consumer prices in Canada. In addition, the impact of declining foreign exchange rates (Brazilian real and the US dollar) relative to the Canadian dollar had a negative impact on the consolidated net sales revenue figure when measured in Canadian dollars. The following table details certain financial information by business unit: -3-
INDUSTRY VOLUME AND MOLSON MARKET SHARE The following table sets out industry volume and Molson volume in Canada, Molson volume shipped to the United States as well as Molson's volume in Brazil during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: VOLUME Three months ended Nine months ended December 31 December 31 --------------------- --------------------- 2004 2003 2004 2003 (Hectolitres in millions) ESTIMATED Actual ESTIMATED Actual - ------------------------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- Industry volume in Canada(i) 5.31 5.33 17.30 17.34 --------- --------- --------- --------- Molson (Canada) 2.22 2.29 7.32 7.64 Molson production for shipment to the United States 0.36 0.39 1.28 1.38 Brazil 2.79 3.14 6.89 7.55 --------- --------- --------- --------- Total Molson volume 5.37 5.82 15.49 16.57 ========= ========= ========= ========= (i) Sources: Brewers of Canada, provincial liquor authorities and industry distribution companies. Total estimated industry sales volume in Canada decreased 0.3% from 5.33 million hectolitres to 5.31 million hectolitres for the three months ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period last year reflecting poor weather conditions across certain regions in Canada, the impact of the National Hockey League strike and newly introduced non-smoking legislation in bars and restaurants in Ontario. Molson's volume in Canada decreased 2.9% to 2.22 million hectolitres during the same period with volume declines in Ontario/West, partially offset by gains in the Quebec/Atlantic region. Molson's overall production for sale in the United States declined 3.4% and Brazil volume declined 11.1% in the quarter. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, total estimated industry sales volume in Canada declined 0.3% to 17.30 million hectolitres compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. Molson's volume in Canada decreased 4.2% to 7.32 million hectolitres during the same period. Molson's production for sale in the United States declined 4.7% while volume in Brazil declined 8.7% to 6.89 million hectolitres. CANADA Net sales revenue increased by 2.3% to $493.1 million in the quarter reflecting higher consumer prices offset by adverse mix due to growth of the discount sector when compared to last year. EBIT decreased 12.1% to $102.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004. EBIT, excluding the merger related costs in the amount of $8.0 million, decreased 5.2% to $110.0 million. The EBIT decline was due to increased selling and pension costs as well as market share erosion due to the strengthening value segment in certain regional markets. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, net sales revenue was virtually flat, increasing by 0.5% to $1,652.3 million reflecting lower volumes partially offset by increased consumer prices. EBIT, excluding the merger related costs in the current year and the provisions for rationalization in both years, decreased 2.7% to $417.6 million. Canada's current cost savings program P125 continues to progress well and remains on track to deliver savings of approximately $43 million in this fiscal year. To date, savings of approximately $30 million have been achieved in the nine months ended December 31, 2004. -4-
MARKET SHARE (%) Three months ended Nine months ended December 31 December 31 --------------------- --------------------- 2004 2003 2004 2003 ESTIMATED Actual ESTIMATED Actual --------- --------- --------- --------- Including sales of imports: Canada 41.8 42.9 42.3 44.1 Quebec/Atlantic 42.8 42.2 42.8 43.7 Ontario/West 41.2 43.3 42.0 44.3 Sources: Brewers of Canada, provincial liquor authorities and industry distribution companies. Estimated average market share for all beer sold in Canada declined 1.1 share points to 41.8% from 42.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period last year. This decline was due to the continued share softness in Ontario and the West, partially offset by growth in Quebec. The Quebec region's total market share increased reflecting the strong performance of Coors Light(R), Heineken(R) and Corona(R). The Atlantic region performance was also strong reflecting gains in Canadian(R) and Canadian Light(R). In Ontario and the West, the overall region's market share continued to decline as a result of softness in unsupported brands and Canadian(R). The Corporation has responded aggressively to the ongoing price discounting in the Ontario and Alberta market, introducing new SKUs and discount prices where appropriate. Competitor discount activity continues to be supported by preferential tax rates regional brewers receive in those markets. BRAZIL The following table summarizes the operating results of Molson's Brazilian business in Brazilian reais and the equivalent Canadian dollar amounts: (i) Results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 exclude the rationalization provision of $36.1 million, before minority interest. Results for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004 exclude the impairment charge of $210.0 million and the rationalization provision of $37.3 million, before minority interest. Results for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003 exclude the rationalization provision of 43.3 million. In December 2004, Kaiser launched a new marketing campaign for the Brazilian summer, named "Vem Kaiser Vem". This campaign is part of a new marketing strategy which commenced with a change of advertising agency during the quarter. Total sales volume for the quarter was 2.79 million hectolitres representing a decline of 11.1%, compared to last year volume of 3.14 million hectolitres. Year-to-date volume was 6.89 million hectolitres compared to 7.55 million hectolitres for the same period last year, a decline of 8.7%. Total estimated Molson market share in Brazil was 9.7% for the three-month period ended December 31, 2004 compared to 12.1% for the same period last year and 10.5% for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 compared to 12.5% last year, according to ACNielsen data. The trend of declining market share slowed in the quarter with the realization of a slight market share increase in December. Despite the volume decrease of 11.1%, the net sales revenue decreased only 5.4% from R$282.6 million to R$267.3 million in the quarter. Although Kaiser experienced an overall -5-
increase in gross revenue per hectolitre in reais of 6.5% for the quarter versus last year, tax increases implemented in certain regions in the latter part of the Corporation's fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were not fully passed on to the consumer and continue to negatively affect net sales revenue and margin. Returnable containers, the most profitable segment for the company, comprised 54.2% of the total sales in the quarter compared to 50.2% in the same period of last year. Net sales revenue per hectolitre improved in December due in part to a 4.5% retail price increase taken late in the month along with reduced discounting activities. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, net sales revenue decreased 7.3% from R$663.9 million to R$615.6 million. Net sales revenue, as measured in Canadian dollars, decreased 8.3% in the current quarter and 11.5% year-to-date reflecting the variance in the Brazilian real exchange rate in addition to the above-noted factors. EBIT in the current quarter was adversely affected by the operating costs of the sales centres established in the latter part of fiscal 2004 and resulted in higher sales costs of approximately R$15 million compared to the same period last year. Marketing and other costs though were R$15 million less than the same period last year (offsetting this impact) as a result of the timing of certain marketing and other programs and the impact of rationalization activities and other cost saving initiatives. The previously announced closure of the Queimados brewery occurred in the quarter. The rationalization provision of $36.1 million includes $24.1 million to write-down fixed assets and $12.0 million for severance and other closure costs related to the brewery closure and the sales centre right-sizing program. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation recorded a charge of $43.3 million relating to the closure of the Ribeirao Preto plant in Brazil represented by a $37.5 million write-down of fixed assets to the net recoverable amount and employee severance and other closure costs of $5.8 million. There is no remaining accrual. In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Corporation revised its long-term forecast of net cash flows from operations in Brazil due to declining sales volumes and the loss of market share. The resulting decline in the value of the investment was reflected by a $210.0 million ($168.0 million after minority interest) impairment charge which reduced the goodwill by $130.0 million ($104.0 million after minority interest) and other intangible assets by $80.0 million ($64.0 million after minority interest). The Corporation has reviewed its overall corporate debt structure as it relates to the Brazilian operations to reduce net interest expense and minimize overall risk. Given recent operating losses, a capital contribution of $45.0 million was injected into Brazil with each shareholder making its proportionate contribution. Kaiser's competitive environment remains intense and sales and market share growth as well as profitability are the biggest challenges facing the brewer. Kaiser looks to make gains in expanded distribution, continue the revitalization of the key brands, review the overall commercial structure, eliminate duplication with bottlers and aggressively pursue cost saving projects. -6-
UNITED STATES Molson USA, which is owned 50.1% by Molson and 49.9% by the Coors Brewing Company ("CBC"), is a dedicated business unit in the United States focused on clear operating objectives and a well-defined brand portfolio - Canadian(R), Canadian Light(R), Golden(R), Molson Ice(R) as well as Molson XXX(R). Molson USA is responsible for the marketing and selling of these brands in the United States with CBC providing the sales, distribution and administrative support. The following table summarizes the operating results of Molson's business in the United States in US dollars and the equivalent Canadian dollar amounts: Overall, Molson's total and Canadian(R) trademark volume in the United States for the three months ended December 31, 2004 were down 5.6% and 11.8%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. The reasons for the decline in the quarter have been traced to increased competitive activity along with the diminishing impact of specialty packs primarily in Michigan and Massachusetts. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 Molson's total and Canadian(R) trademark volume were down 5.2% and 8.5%, respectively. While total net sales revenue increased 3.0% in the current quarter, net sales revenue per hectolitre also increased by 9.1%, versus the same period last year as measured in US dollars. This increase in revenue realization is driven by strong front line price increases and improved brand and package mix, driven primarily by the super premium pricing of Molson XXX(R). During the quarter, these gains in pricing were offset by increased operational costs arising primarily from unfavourable foreign exchange. Over the coming quarters, restoring growth on the Canadian(R) trademark, as well as continued focus on slowing the Molson Ice(R) and Golden(R) declining volume will remain a priority. -7-
SELECTED CONSOLIDATED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (i) Restated by $1.0 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2003, reflecting the previously disclosed stock option expense accounting policy change. -8-
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Molson's consolidated balance sheet, together with comparative figures, is summarized as follows: As at December 31, December 31, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2004 - -------------------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ Current assets $ 476.1 $ 497.0 $ 430.2 Less current liabilities (1,205.7) (814.0) (1,025.4) ------------ ------------ ------------ Working capital (729.6) (317.0) (595.2) Investments and other assets 130.6 130.8 129.7 Property, plant and equipment 974.2 991.6 1,022.4 Intangible assets 2,132.9 2,341.6 2,348.3 ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 2,508.1 $ 3,147.0 $ 2,905.2 ============ ============ ============ Represented by: Long-term debt $ 584.6 $ 1,030.3 $ 788.4 Deferred liabilities 297.4 384.7 359.1 Future income taxes 417.9 402.5 400.2 Minority interest 70.8 144.3 138.1 ------------ ------------ ------------ 1,370.7 1,961.8 1,685.8 Shareholders' equity 1,137.4 1,185.2 1,219.4 ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 2,508.1 $ 3,147.0 $ 2,905.2 ============ ============ ============ In fiscal 2005, working capital requirements, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, continued to be funded through cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. The Corporation will be required to refinance long-term debt of $344.7 million (March 31, 2004 -$259.9 million) which has been included in current liabilities with either a new term loan or floating rate notes. The working capital deficit as at December 31, 2004, excluding the $344.7 million (March 31, 2004 - $259.9 million) of current portion of long-term debt, was $384.9 million (March 31, 2004 - $335.3 million) which was $67.9 million below December 31, 2003 due mainly to lower inventory and prepaids in addition to the increase in Brazil current debt due to continued operating losses. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY For the three month periods ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, the Corporation did not repurchase any Class A non-voting or Class B common shares. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, the Corporation repurchased 751,000 Class A non-voting shares at prices ranging between $32.15 and $34.99 and no Class B common shares. The total number of Class A non-voting and Class B common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004 were 127,834,299 (127,282,671 at December 31, 2003) consisting of 107,977,477 (104,839,395 at December 31, 2003) Class A non-voting shares and 19,856,822 (22,443,276 at December 31, 2003) Class B common shares. -9-
DIVIDENDS Dividends declared to shareholders totalled $19.2 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2004, compared with $17.8 million for the same period last year. In fiscal 2005, Molson's quarterly dividend rate was increased by $0.01 or 7% to $0.15 per share effective in the first quarter. SPECIAL DIVIDEND In response to the market reaction to the proposed merger between Molson and Coors, both companies have agreed that Molson will pay a special dividend in connection with the plan of arrangement, to Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders of record at the close of business on the last trading day immediately prior to the date of closing of the merger transaction, excluding Pentland Securities (1981), Inc. The special dividend will be $5.44 per share or approximately $650 million. In January 2005, the Corporation entered into a bridge facility in the amount of $250.0 million for the purpose of paying the special dividend together with existing facilities. The bridge facility will be available for a period of 90 days from the closing of the merger and is expected to be refinanced within that period by a credit facility of the merged company. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES Molson's consolidated long-term debt was as follows: As at December 31, December 31, March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2004 - ------------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------ Molson Inc. Term loan $ 144.7 $ 39.9 $ 59.9 Debentures - 150.0 150.0 Floating rate notes 200.0 250.0 250.0 Molson Canada Debentures 575.3 578.2 577.6 Brazil 123.1 110.7 97.9 ------------ ------------ ------------ 1,043.1 1,128.8 1,135.4 Less current portion 458.5 98.5 347.0 ------------ ------------ ------------ $ 584.6 $ 1,030.3 $ 788.4 ============ ============ ============ The medium-term note program is an agreement under which the Corporation may issue debt under terms and conditions that are only determined at the time of placement of the debt. As such, the Corporation's term loan and the $200.0 million floating rate notes are classified as current liabilities. It is the Corporation's intention to refinance with either a new term loan or through the medium-term note program or other facility. On October 19, 2004, a one year $50.0 million floating rate note matured and was refinanced using the term loan credit facility. On February 8, 2005, the Corporation announced its intent to request approval for the redemption of the $200.0 million floating rate medium term notes from the note holders. Note holder consent of at least 66 2/3% of the aggregate principal amount is required and the Corporation expects to have such consent by February 22, 2005. To compensate note holders, the redemption price will include a premium of 0.23% of principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The Corporation also announced its intent to redeem the Molson debentures. The debentures will be redeemed on March 18, 2005 for an aggregate amount of approximately $690 million including the accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. -10-
Both the floating rate notes and the debenture redemptions will be financed through a credit facility of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Dominion Bond Rating Service, or DBRS, current credit rating for Molson Inc. and Molson Canada's ratings is A (low) and A respectively. On July 20, 2004, DBRS announced that its long-term ratings of Molson Inc. and Molson Canada were placed under review with negative implications, pending clarification of the proposed merger transaction. DBRS stated that once the structure of the combined company is final, DBRS would be in a position to assess how the proposed merger would impact Molson's credit ratings. On July 26, 2004 Standard and Poor's revised its outlook on Molson Inc. and Molson Canada to negative from stable. At the same time, the BBB+ long-term credit rating on Molson Inc. and Molson Canada was affirmed. On September 16, 2004, a third party bank exercised its right to cancel the interest rate swap which converted $100.0 million of the Corporation's floating rate note maturing September 16, 2005 to a fixed rate. The Corporation also has an interest rate swap for $100.0 million which converts the Molson Canada debenture due June 2, 2008 with a fixed rate of 6.0% to a variable rate. CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS The increase in cash of $6.0 million in the current quarter and $3.5 million year-to-date, together with a comparison for fiscal 2004, is summarized below: For the three months ended December 31, 2004, cash provided from operating activities increased 18.1% to $15.0 million from $12.7 million in the same period last year. The increase reflected improved working capital partially offset by lower net earnings and increased pension funding in comparison to the prior year. Included in operating activities in the current quarter was cash used for working capital of $6.6 million compared to cash used of $67.8 million in the same quarter last year. The improvement related primarily to lower inventory and prepaids as well as higher accounts payable. During the three-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash used for financing activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 included a net increase in long-term debt of $48.3 million offset by a $23.0 million decrease from securitization of accounts receivable and dividends paid of $18.6 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, cash used for financing activities included a net increase in long-term debt of $34.6 million, offset by a $31.0 million decrease from securitization of accounts receivable and by dividends paid of $16.6 million. -11-
Cash provided from discontinued operations consisted of $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $7.2 million used for in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 for operating activities to fund obligations previously provided for in the accounts. IMPAIRMENT CHARGE In the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Molson recorded an impairment charge of $210.0 million ($168.0 million after minority interest). As at March 31, 2004, Molson estimated that the fair value of the Brazil intangible assets exceeded their book value and that strategic initiatives underway to grow volume would be successful. A review of the performance achieved during the first half of fiscal 2005 made it clear that volume growth would be more difficult to achieve and take more time than anticipated. Accordingly, in determining the value of the Brazil goodwill and intangible assets, assumptions were revised to reflect this more conservative estimate. OUTLOOK In a special shareholder meeting held on January 28, 2005, holders of Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shares approved the proposed merger with Coors. The proposed merger received the approval of Coors stockholders at a special meeting on February 1, 2005, and the transaction was also approved by the Quebec Superior Court on February 2, 2005. Molson Coors Brewing Company is the fifth-largest brewer in the world, with pro-forma combined annual volume of 60 million hectoliters and net sales of more than US$6 billion. Molson Coors has a leading market share in Canada and in the U.K., a growth profile in the U.S. and an emerging market opportunity in Brazil, as well as a portfolio of well-established brands including Molson Canadian, Coors Light and Carling. The combination is expected to unlock significant value for shareholders. From the outset, value creation will come from the ability to focus marketing investments on core brands to grow revenues and the ability to capture an expected US$175 million in annualized synergies, expected to be realized within the first three years following completion of the merger. Secondly, a stronger overall financial platform will lead to deeper support of core brands and key markets to drive revenue, share and volume growth. Finally the merger will create the scale and balance sheet strength to allow Molson Coors Brewing Company to compete more effectively in the increasingly global and highly dynamic brewing industry long-term.

MOLSON INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (Dollars in millions, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES These interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, using the same accounting policies as outlined in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004, except as noted below. They do not conform in all respects with disclosures required for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004 of Molson Inc.'s 2004 Annual Report. NOTE 2. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES Effective April 1, 2004, the Corporation adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") Accounting Guideline 13 "Hedging Relationships", which establishes certain conditions regarding when hedge accounting may be applied. The relevant hedging relationships will be subject to an effectiveness test on a regular basis for reasonable assurance that it is and will continue to be effective. Under these rules, any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting will be reported on a mark-to-market basis in earnings. Effective April 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted, on a prospective basis, the CICA Handbook section 3870 "Stock-Based Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments". Effective April 1, 2003, the Corporation began to expense the cost of stock option grants, with a restatement of the prior period. The Corporation determines the cost of all stock options granted since April 1, 2002 using a fair value method. This method of accounting uses an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted and the amount is amortized over the period in which the related employee services are rendered. Opening retained earnings for fiscal 2004 was reduced by $3.7 reflecting the full year effect of fiscal 2003 stock option expense. NOTE 3. IMPAIRMENT CHARGE In the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the Corporation determined that the fair value of the Brazil intangible assets had decreased below book value. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $210.0 ($168.0 after minority interest) which reduced the goodwill by $130.0 ($104.0 after minority interest) and brand names by $80.0 ($64.0 after minority interest). NOTE 4. MERGER RELATED COSTS AND PROVISIONS FOR RATIONALIZATION On July 21, 2004, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Adolph Coors Company ("Coors") to combine the two companies. As a result of the proposed merger, $8.0 in costs were incurred in the current quarter, $24.0 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and consist mainly of investment banking, legal and accounting fees. In addition, the Corporation recorded a charge for provisions for rationalization of $36.1, relating to the closure of the Queimados brewery and organization right-sizing including sales centres. The rationalization provision includes $24.1 to write-down fixed assets and $12.0 for severance, other closure costs related to the brewery closure and the sales centre right-sizing program as well as an accrual for additional labour contingencies relating to previously closed breweries in Brazil. During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation recorded a charge of $43.3 relating to the closure of the Ribeirao Preto plant in Brazil represented by a $37.5 write-down of fixed assets to net recoverable amount and employee severance and other closure costs of $5.8. There is no remaining accrual. -16-
MOLSON INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (Dollars in millions, except share and per share amounts) NOTE 4. MERGER RELATED COSTS AND PROVISIONS FOR RATIONALIZATION (CONT'D) Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation completed a sale of a residual property adjacent to the Barrie brewery. A pre-tax gain of $7.0 was recorded in the provision for rationalization line in the statement of earnings which is consistent with the original Barrie plant closure provision. NOTE 5. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share computations for net earnings (loss): The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is based on the application of the treasury stock method. Under this method, the proceeds from the potential exercise of such stock options are assumed to be used to purchase Class A non-voting shares. During the current quarter of fiscal 2005, options to purchase 636,349 (fiscal 2004 - 620,575) Class A non-voting shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise price exceeded the average market price of the shares in the three-month period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, no dilution impact was calculated due to the net loss incurred. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, 620,575 Class A non-voting shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. NOTE 6. LONG-TERM DEBT The floating rate note program is an agreement under which the Corporation and the placement agent may agree to issue debt under terms and conditions that are only determined at the time of placement of the debt. As such, the Corporation's term loan and the $200.0 floating rate notes are classified as current liabilities. It is the Corporation's intention to refinance this debt with either a new term loan or through the medium-term note program or other facility. On October 19, 2004, the one year $50.0 floating rate note matured and was refinanced using the term loan credit facility. The Corporation had a $50.0 364-day revolving credit facility that expired on September 14, 2004 which the Corporation did not renew. There were no amounts drawn on this facility. On September 16, 2004, a third party bank exercised its right to cancel the interest rate swap which converted $100.0 of the Corporation's floating rate note maturing September 16, 2005 to a fixed rate. The Corporation also has an interest rate swap for $100.0 which converted the Molson Canada debenture due June 2, 2008 with a fixed rate of 6.0% to a variable rate. -17-

In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, the Corporation repurchased 751,000 Class A non-voting shares at prices ranging between $32.15 and $34.99 and no Class B common shares. In fiscal 2004, of the total amount of $24.6 repurchased, $4.2 was charged to capital stock based on the weighted-average stated capital with the excess of $20.4 being charged to retained earnings. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Corporation has a stock option plan for eligible employees and non-employee directors of the Corporation, under which Class A non-voting shares of the Corporation may be purchased at a price equal to the market price of the common shares at the date of granting of the option. The options vest over a period of two, three, four or five years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant. At December 31, 2004, there were 5,716,380 (2003 - 5,090,750) stock options outstanding and 929,101 (2003 - 2,028,013) stock options available for future grants. During the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the Corporation granted, less forfeitures, 977,900 (2004 - 855,725) stock options at exercise prices of $31.44 and $33.21 (2004 - ranging between $32.31 and $36.96). The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants during the nine-month period: dividend yield of 1.4% (2003 - 1.6%); expected volatility of 24.7% (2003 - 25.5%), risk-free interest rate of 4.2% (2003 - 4.4%); and an expected life of 6 years (2003 -6 years). The weighted average fair value of options granted in the nine-month period is $8.84 (2003 - $9.29) per share. The Corporation has recorded $5.0 (2003 - $4.0) related to stock option expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. The Corporation's contributions to the employee share ownership plan ("MESOP") of $1.3 (2003 -$1.3) were charged to earnings during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2004, 136,449 (2003 - 161,371) Deferred Share Units ("DSU's") were outstanding. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, $0.8 (2003 - $0.4) was charged to earnings representing the accrual for services provided in the period which were paid with the issuance of DSU's. -18-
