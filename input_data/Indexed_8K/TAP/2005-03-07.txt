    If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Applicable Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement, in the currency in which such LC Disbursement shall have been made, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date three Business Days after the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the applicable Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, or, if such notice has not been received by the applicable Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on (A) the date three Business Days after the date that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on the day of receipt, or (B) the date four Business Days after the date that the applicable Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt;
provided
that the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with (i) in the case of a payment relating to a Letter of Credit issued for the account of the Company or a US Borrowing Subsidiary, an ABR Borrowing (in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in US Dollars), a Eurocurrency Borrowing or a Swingline Loan, (ii) in the case of a payment relating to a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, a Canadian Base Rate Borrowing or a B/A drawing (in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars), an ABR Loan (in the case of a Letter of Credit Denominated in US Dollars), a Eurocurrency Loan (in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in US Dollars) or a Swingline Loan, or (iii) in the case of a payment relating to a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a UK Borrowing Subsidiary, a Eurocurrency Borrowing or a Swingline Loan, in each case in an equivalent amount and in the currency of the applicable LC Disbursement, and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing or Swingline Loan. Promptly following receipt by the Applicable Agent of any payment from the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Applicable Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. If the applicable Borrower fails to make such payment when due, directly or through a Borrowing or Swingline Loan, then, upon notice from the applicable Issuing Bank to the applicable Borrower and the Applicable Agent, the Applicable Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the amount and currency of the payment then due from the applicable Borrower in respect thereof and the percentage of such LC Disbursement allocated to such Lender, which shall be (i) in the case of a Global Tranche Letter of Credit, such Lender's
Global Tranche Percentage of such amount and (ii) in the case of a US/UK Tranche Letter of Credit, such Lender's US/UK Tranche Percentage of such amount. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each applicable Lender shall pay to the Applicable Agent its allocated percentage of the payment then due from the applicable Borrower in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Applicable Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the applicable Lenders. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Loans or Swingline Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
        (f)
    Obligations Absolute.
    Without limiting the application of the other provisions of this Section 2.05(f), the Borrowers' obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any term or provision herein or therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against, the Borrowers' obligations hereunder. None of the Agents, the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Issuing Bank;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the applicable Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
        (g)
    Disbursement Procedures.
    Each Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Applicable Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank
has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the applicable Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank and the applicable Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
        (h)
    Interim Interest.
    If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the applicable Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at (i) in the case of any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in US Dollars, the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans, (ii) in the case of any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars, the rate per annum then applicable to Canadian Base Rate Loans, (iii) in the case of any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in Sterling, the Bank of England Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate then applicable to Eurocurrency Loans and (iv) in the case of any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit denominated in Euro, the European Central Bank Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate then applicable to Eurocurrency Loans;
provided
that, at all times after the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse an Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
        (i)
    Designation of Additional Issuing Banks.
    From time to time, the Company may by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders designate as additional Issuing Banks one or more Lenders that agree to serve in such capacity as provided below;
provided
, that no Lender shall be designated as an Issuing Bank if, after giving effect to such designation, there would be more than four Issuing Banks in addition to the Initial Issuing Banks. The acceptance by a Lender of any appointment as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall be evidenced by an Issuing Bank Agreement, which shall state whether such Lender is to be a US Issuing Bank, a UK Issuing Bank or a Canadian Issuing Bank and be executed by such Lender, the Company and the Administrative Agent, and from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of a US Issuing Bank, a UK Issuing Bank or a Canadian Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "US Issuing Bank", "UK Issuing Bank" or "Canadian Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to include such Lender in its capacity as a US Issuing Bank, UK Issuing Bank or Canadian Issuing Bank, as applicable.
        (j)
    Replacement of an Issuing Bank.
    Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld), the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of any Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "US Issuing Bank" (if the replaced Issuing Bank is a US Issuing Bank), "Canadian Issuing Bank" (if the replaced Issuing Bank is a Canadian Issuing Bank) or "UK Issuing Bank" (if the replaced Issuing Bank is a UK Issuing Bank) and the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto
and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
        (k)
    Cash Collateralization.
    If the Commitments shall have been terminated or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Commitments hereunder terminated and the Loans hereunder accelerated, then the Company shall deposit in an account with the Applicable Agent, in the name of the Applicable Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Specified Event with respect to the Company. Such deposit shall be held by the Applicable Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents. The Applicable Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. At the request of the Company, amounts so deposited shall be invested by the Applicable Agent, at the Company's risk and expense, in high quality overnight or short-term cash equivalent investments of prime financial institutions (which may include any Applicable Agent) maturing prior to the date or dates on which the Applicable Agent anticipates that such amounts will be applied as required by this paragraph. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Applicable Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Company under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
        (l)
    Issuing Bank Agreements.
    Unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the face amount and currency of such Letter of Credit, the expiry date of such Letter of Credit (after giving effect to any such amendment, renewal or extension), the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued and whether such Letter of Credit is a Global Tranche Letter of Credit or a US/UK Tranche Letter of Credit, (ii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date, amount and currency of such LC Disbursement and the Letter of Credit to which it relates, (iii) on any Business Day on which the Borrower reimburses an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank, the date, amount and currency of such reimbursement and the Letter of Credit to which it relates, (iv) promptly following the expiry of any Letter of Credit issued by it, the identity and amount of such Letter of Credit, (iv) on any Business Day on which the Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount and currency of such LC Disbursement, (v) on or promptly after the last Business Day of each month, a listing of all the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, setting forth as to each such Letter of Credit its amount, currency and expiry date, the Borrower for whose account it was issued and whether such Letter of Credit is a Global Tranche Letter of Credit or a US/UK Tranche Letter of Credit, and (vi) on any other Business Day, such other information related to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. Each Issuing
Bank agrees that it will not issue or increase the amount of any Letter of Credit without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such issuance or increase is then permitted under this Agreement.
        SECTION 2.06.
    Canadian Bankers' Acceptances.
    (a) Each acceptance and purchase of B/As of a single Contract Period pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.08 shall be made ratably by the Global Tranche Lenders in accordance with the amounts of their Global Tranche Commitments. The failure of any Global Tranche Lender to accept any B/A required to be accepted by it shall not relieve any other Global Tranche Lender of its obligations hereunder;
provided
that the Global Tranche Commitments are several and no Global Tranche Lender shall be responsible for any other Global Tranche Lender's failure to accept B/As as required. Each Lender at its option may accept and purchase any B/A by causing any Canadian lending office or Canadian Affiliate of such Lender to accept and purchase such B/A, and all references in this Section to "Lender" shall apply to any such Canadian lending office or Canadian Affiliate of such Lender.
        (b)   The B/As of a single Contract Period accepted and purchased on any date shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of Cdn.$1,000,000 and not less than Cdn.$5,000,000. If any Global Tranche Lender's ratable share of the B/As of any Contract Period to be accepted on any date would not be an integral multiple of Cdn.$100,000, the face amount of the B/As accepted by such Lender may be increased or reduced to the nearest integral multiple of Cdn.$100,000 by the Canadian Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. B/As of more than one Contract Period may be outstanding at the same time;
provided
that there shall not at any time be more than a total of seven B/A Drawings outstanding, or such greater number agreed to by the Canadian Administrative Agent.
        (c)   To request an acceptance and purchase of B/As, a Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall notify the Canadian Administrative Agent of such request by telephone or by telecopy not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of such acceptance and purchase. Each such request shall be irrevocable and, if telephonic, shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Canadian Administrative Agent of a written request in a form approved by the Canadian Administrative Agent and signed by such Borrower. Each such telephonic and written request shall specify the following information:
        (i)    the aggregate face amount of the B/As to be accepted and purchased;
        (ii)   the date of such acceptance and purchase, which shall be a Business Day;
        (iii)  the Contract Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Contract Period" (and which shall in no event end after the Maturity Date); and
        (iv)  the location and number of the Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary's account to which any funds are to be disbursed. If no Contract Period is specified with respect to any requested acceptance and purchase of B/As, then the Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall be deemed to have selected a Contract Period of 30 days' duration.
Promptly following receipt of a request in accordance with this paragraph, the Canadian Administrative Agent shall advise each Global Tranche Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of B/As to be accepted and purchased by such Lender.
        (d)   Each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary hereby appoints each Global Tranche Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf, manually or by facsimile or mechanical signature, as and when deemed necessary by such Lender, blank forms of B/As, each Lender hereby agreeing that it will not sign or endorse B/As in excess of those required in connection with B/A Drawings that have been requested by the Canadian Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder. It shall be the
responsibility of each Global Tranche Lender to maintain an adequate supply of blank forms of B/As for acceptance under this Agreement. Each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary recognizes and agrees that all B/As signed and/or endorsed on its behalf by any Global Tranche Lender in accordance with such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary's written request shall bind such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as fully and effectually as if manually signed and duly issued by authorized officers of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary. Each Global Tranche Lender is hereby authorized to issue such B/As endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by such Lender;
provided
that the aggregate face amount thereof is equal to the aggregate face amount of B/As required to be accepted by such Lender in accordance with such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary's written request. No Global Tranche Lender shall be liable for any damage, loss or claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such instrument unless such loss or improper use results from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender. Each Global Tranche Lender shall maintain a record with respect to B/As (i) received by it from the Canadian Administrative Agent in blank hereunder, (ii) voided by it for any reason, (iii) accepted and purchased by it hereunder and (iv) canceled at their respective maturities. Each Global Tranche Lender further agrees to retain such records in the manner and for the periods provided in applicable provincial or Federal statutes and regulations of Canada and to provide such records to each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary upon its request and at its expense. Upon request by any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, a Global Tranche Lender shall cancel all forms of B/A that have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary and that are held by such Global Tranche Lender and are not required to be issued pursuant to this Agreement.
        (e)   Drafts of each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be signed as set forth in paragraph (d) above. Notwithstanding that any Person whose signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any of the Lenders or such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary at the date of issuance of such B/A, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed and properly completed shall be binding on such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary.
        (f)    Upon acceptance of a B/A by a Lender, such Lender shall purchase such B/A from the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary at the Discount Rate for such Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as provided in Section 2.07. The acceptance fee payable by the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to a Lender under Section 2.12 in respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the Discount Proceeds payable by such Lender under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any B/A Drawing resulting from the conversion or continuation of a B/A Drawing or Global Tranche Loan pursuant to Section 2.08, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary by each Lender pursuant to this paragraph will be applied as provided in Section 2.08(e).
        (g)   Each Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/A's accepted and purchased by it (it being understood that no such sale, rediscount or disposition shall constitute an assignment or participation of any Commitment hereunder).
        (h)   Each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder shall mature at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto.
        (i)    Subject to applicable law, each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Lender in respect of a B/A
accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right and each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as holder sues such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary on the B/A for payment of the amounts payable by such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall pay the Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A, and after such payment such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.
        (j)    At the option of each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary and any Global Tranche Lender, B/As under this Agreement to be accepted by that Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All depository bills so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 2.06.
        (k)   If a Global Tranche Lender is not a chartered bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Global Tranche Lender notifies the Canadian Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept B/As, such Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing B/As, make a Loan (a "
B/A Equivalent Loan
") to the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the amount and for the same term as each draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Lender will provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the same manner as such Lender would have provided the Discount Proceeds in respect of the draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would result if such Lender had accepted (and been paid an acceptance fee) and purchased (on a discounted basis) a B/A for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Lenders and the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as the B/A that such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and will be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan in the same manner in which the Discount Proceeds of a B/A would be deducted from the face amount of the B/A. Subject to the repayment requirements of this Agreement, on the last day of the relevant Contract Period for such B/A Equivalent Loan, the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall be entitled to convert each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another type of Loan, or to roll over each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another B/A Equivalent Loan, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
        (l)    Notwithstanding any provision hereof but subject to Section 2.11(b), the Borrowers may not prepay any B/A Drawing other than on the last day of its Contract Period.
        (m)  For greater certainty, all provisions of this Agreement which are applicable to B/As shall also be applicable, mutatis mutandis, to B/A Equivalent Loans.
        SECTION 2.07.
    Funding of Borrowings and B/A Drawings.
    (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) to be made and disburse the Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) of each B/A to be accepted and purchased by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose for Loans of such Class and currency by notice to the applicable Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04. The Applicable Agent will make such Loans or Discount
Proceeds available to the relevant Borrower by crediting the amounts so received, in like funds by 2:00 p.m., Local Time, to an account of such Borrower notified by the Borrower to the Applicable Agent; provided that the proceeds of any Loans or B/A Drawing made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
        (b)   Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing or acceptance and purchase of B/As that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees), the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan or the applicable Discount Rate and pro-rated acceptance fee, as the case may be (subject to the return of such interest as provided in the next sentence). If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing or such Lender's purchase of B/As and the Applicable Agent shall return to such Borrower any amount (including interest) paid by such Borrower to the Applicable Agent pursuant to this paragraph.
        SECTION 2.08.
    Interest Elections and Contract Periods.
    (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Each B/A Drawing shall have a Contract Period as specified in the applicable request therefor. Thereafter, the relevant Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing or B/A Drawing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing, Swingline Loan or B/A Drawing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing or Swingline Loan, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section and on terms consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement, it being understood that (i) no Borrowing or B/A Drawing may be converted to a Borrowing or B/A Drawing denominated in a different currency, (ii) no B/A Drawing may be converted or continued other than at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto and (iii) no Borrowing or B/A Drawing denominated in Canadian Dollars may be converted to a Eurocurrency Borrowing. A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Borrowing or B/A Drawing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing or purchasing the B/As comprising the B/A Drawing, as the case may be, and the Loans or B/As comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing or B/A Drawing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued pursuant to this Section 2.08. Any designation of an Interest Period with respect to a Swingline Loan shall be made pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.04.
        (b)   To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower, or the Company on its behalf, shall notify the Applicable Agent of such election by telephone (i) in the case of an election that would result in a Borrowing, by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election, and (ii) in the case of an election that would result in a B/A Drawing or the continuation of a B/A Drawing, by the time and date that a request would be required under Section 2.06 if such Borrower were requesting an acceptance and
purchase of B/As to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the relevant Borrower, or by the Company on its behalf. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit any Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.
        (c)   Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 or Section 2.06, as applicable:
        (i)    the Borrowing or B/A Drawing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing);
        (ii)   the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
        (iii)  in the case of an election resulting in a Borrowing, the Type of the resulting Borrowing; and
        (iv)  if the resulting Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period", and in the case of an election of a B/A Drawing, the Contract Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Contract Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing or a B/A Drawing but does not specify an Interest Period or a Contract Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration or a Contract Period of 30 days' duration, as applicable. Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Applicable Agent shall advise each Lender holding a Loan to which such request relates of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing or B/A Drawing.
        (d)   If a Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing or B/A Drawing, then (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in US Dollars, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) in the case of any B/A Drawing, unless such B/A Drawing is repaid as provided herein, such B/A Drawing shall be converted into a Canadian Base Rate Borrowing and (iii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Sterling or Euros, such Borrowing shall be repaid at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
        (e)   Upon the conversion of any Borrowing (or portion thereof), or the continuation of any B/A Drawing (or portion thereof), to or as a B/A Drawing, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to a Borrower by each Lender pursuant to Section 2.06(f) in respect of such new B/A Drawing shall be applied against the principal of the Loan made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing (in the case of a conversion), or the reimbursement obligation owed to such Lender under Section 2.06(i) in respect of the B/As accepted by such Lender as part of such maturing B/A Drawing (in the case of a continuation), and such Borrower shall pay to the Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender an amount equal to the difference between
the principal amount of such Loan or the aggregate face amount of such maturing B/As, as the case may be, and such net amount.
        SECTION 2.09.
    Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments.
    (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate (i) on March 31, 2005, if the initial borrowing hereunder shall not have occurred on or prior to such date and (ii) on the Maturity Date.
        (b)   The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum, or the entire amount of the Commitments of such Class, (ii) the Company will not terminate or reduce the Global Tranche Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Global Tranche Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the aggregate Global Tranche Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate Global Tranche Commitments and (iii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the US/UK Tranche Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the US/UK Tranche Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the aggregate US/UK Tranche Credit Exposures would exceed the aggregate US/UK Tranche Commitments.
        (c)   The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments of any Class under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying the effective date of such election. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Canadian Administrative Agent and the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Except as provided in Section 2.09(e), each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.
        (d)   The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, request that the total Commitments under any Tranche be increased (a "
Commitment Increase
") by an amount for each increased Tranche of not less than US$25,000,000;
provided
that the aggregate amount of increases under all Tranches pursuant to this sentence shall not exceed the excess of (A) $250,000,000 over (B) the aggregate amount by which new Commitments of any Class established pursuant to Section 2.09(e) shall exceed the simultaneous reductions in the Global Tranche Commitments and/or the US/UK Tranche Commitments of the Lenders participating in such new Class. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in each Tranche, and the date (the "
Increase Effective Date
") on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days or more than 45 days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Lender holding a Commitment under each applicable Tranche the opportunity to increase its Commitment in such Tranche by its Tranche Percentage of the proposed increased amount. Each such Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not more than 5 Business Days after the date of the Company's notice, either agree to increase its applicable Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount (each Lender so agreeing being an "
Increasing Lender
" with respect to such Tranche) or decline to increase its applicable Commitment (and any Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of 5 Business Days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment) (each Lender so declining or deemed to have declined being a "
Non-Increasing Lender
" with respect to such Tranche). In the event that on the 5th Business Day after the Company shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first
sentence of this paragraph the Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Commitments under any Tranche by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the total Commitments requested by the Company, the Company may arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution being called an "
Augmenting Lender
" with respect to such Tranche), which may include any Lender, to extend Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount;
provided
that each Augmenting Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Borrowers and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent and the Company shall reasonably specify to evidence the Commitment of such Augmenting Lender and its status as a Lender hereunder. On the Increase Effective Date, (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding under each Tranche under which a Commitment Increase will become effective (the "
Initial Loans
" under such Tranche) immediately prior to giving effect to the applicable Commitment Increase on the Increase Effective Date shall be deemed to be repaid, (B) after the effectiveness of the Commitment Increase, the Borrowers holding Commitments under such Tranche shall be deemed to have made new Borrowings (the "
Subsequent Borrowings
") in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Loans under such Tranche and of the types and for the Interest Periods specified in a Borrowing Request delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.03, (C) each Lender under such Tranche shall pay to the Applicable Agent in same day funds an amount equal to the difference, if positive, between (x) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Subsequent Borrowings and (y) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans, (D) after the Applicable Agent receives the funds specified in clause (C) above, the Applicable Agent shall pay to each Lender under such Tranche the portion of such funds that is equal to the difference, if positive, between (1) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated without giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the Initial Loans and (2) such Lender's Tranche Percentage (calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) of the amount of the Subsequent Borrowings, (E) each Non-Increasing Lender, each Increasing Lender and each Augmenting Lender shall be deemed to hold its Tranche Percentage of each Subsequent Borrowing (each calculated after giving effect to the Commitment Increase) and (F) each applicable Borrower shall pay each Increasing Lender and each Non-Increasing Lender any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Initial Loans. The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (A) above in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan or B/A Equivalent Loan shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the Increase Effective Date occurs other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto and breakage costs actually result therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments under any Tranche (or in any Commitment of any Lender) or addition of an Augmenting Lender shall become effective under this Section unless, (A) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company, and (B) the Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Lenders) documents consistent with those delivered pursuant to Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of the applicable Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase.
        (e)   Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Company shall desire to designate after the date hereof as Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder one or more Subsidiaries organized under the laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof and shall determine that payments of interest or fees by any such Subsidiary to one or more of the Global Tranche Lenders would be subject to withholding taxes if made under
the arrangements provided for herein, the Company may request Lenders selected by it that would be able to receive such payments free of withholding taxes to establish hereunder an additional Class of Commitments under which Loans would be made available to such Borrowing Subsidiaries and, if the Company shall so elect, to the Company and one or more other Borrowing Subsidiaries, and, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, the Company may increase total Commitments in connection with the establishment of such Class. Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, any such additional Class of Commitments may be established by a written amendment to this Agreement entered into by the Company, the Administrative Agent and each Lender that shall agree to provide a Commitment of such Class, and shall not require the consent of any other Lender;
provided
, that: (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the new Commitments of any Class established pursuant to this paragraph shall not, without the consent of the Required Lenders, exceed the sum of (A) US$250,000,000 minus the aggregate amount by which the Commitments shall theretofore have been increased pursuant to paragraph (d) above and (B) the aggregate amount of any simultaneous reductions of the Global Tranche Commitments and/or the US/UK Tranche Commitments of the Lenders extending Commitments as part of such new Class (and any such reductions may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, be effected by the amendment agreement establishing such new Class without any corresponding reduction of the Commitments of the other Global Tranche Lenders or US/UK Tranche Lenders, as the case may be); and (ii) the terms applicable to the Commitments and Borrowings of any new Class shall be the same as those applicable to the original Classes except as required or deemed appropriate by the Company and the Administrative Agent to make the Commitments and Loans of such new Class available to the intended Borrowing Subsidiaries. Any such amendment agreement shall, subject to the preceding sentence, amend the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to set forth the terms of such new Class and the Borrowings thereunder and make such other amendments to this Agreement (including to Sections 2.18, 7.02, 7.03 and 10.02) as shall be necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Company and the Administrative Agent to make the benefits of this Agreement available to the Lenders participating in such new Class. Further, any such amendment agreement shall amend the provisions of this Agreement (including the definition of Excluded Taxes and Section 2.17) as shall be necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Company and the Administrative Agent to ensure that payments by or to Lenders participating in such new Class shall not be subject to withholding taxes imposed by Canada and the United States in effect on the date each such Lender becomes a participant in the new Class. The Commitments, Loans and Borrowings of any Class established pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute Commitments, Loans and Borrowings under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from the Guarantees created by the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement to the extent provided therein.
        SECTION 2.10.
    Repayment of Loans and B/As; Evidence of Debt.
    (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Applicable Agent for the accounts of the applicable Lenders (i) the then unpaid principal amount of each Borrowing (other than any Swingline Loan) of such Borrower on the Maturity Date, (ii) the face amount of each B/A, if any, accepted by such Lender as provided in Section 2.06 and (iii) the then unpaid amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least five Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made;
provided
that on each date that (i) a US/UK Tranche Borrowing or a Global Tranche Borrowing is made by a Borrower or (ii) B/As are drawn by a Borrower, such Borrower shall repay all its Swingline Loans denominated in the same currency as such Borrowing or B/A Drawing that were outstanding on the date such Borrowing or B/A Drawing is made. Each Borrower agrees to repay the principal amount of each Loan or B/A made to or drawn by such Borrower and the accrued interest on such Loan in the currency of such Loan or B/A.
        (b)   Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made or B/A accepted by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest and amounts in respect of B/As payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
        (c)   The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts (including the Register described in Section 10.04) in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class, Type and currency thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder and the Contract Period applicable thereto, (iii) the amount and currency of each Letter of Credit issued hereunder, (iv) the amount of any principal, interest or other amount due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to any Lender hereunder and (v) the amounts received by any Agent hereunder for the accounts of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof. The Administrative Agent shall make the information in such accounts available to the Canadian Administrative Agent from time to time upon its request. The Canadian Administrative Agent shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, promptly after the making of any Loan, Borrowing or B/A Drawing or the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit with respect to which it is the Applicable Agent or the receipt of any payment of principal or interest with respect to any such Loan or Borrowing or other amounts with respect to any such B/A, information with respect thereto that will enable the Administrative Agent to maintain the accounts referred to in the preceding sentence.
        (d)   The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall, to the extent consistent with the Register, be
prima facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans or amounts payable in respect of B/As in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
        (e)   Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it to any Borrower be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Administrative Agent, acting reasonably. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by each such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns.
        SECTION 2.11.
    Prepayment of Loans.
    (a) Any Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing (but for greater certainty not any B/A Drawing) of such Borrower in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
        (b)   If the Revolving Credit Exposures of any Class shall exceed the aggregate Commitments of such Class (other than solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates), the Borrowers shall promptly prepay Loans and/or amounts owed in respect of outstanding B/As in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess. If the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures of any Class (in the case of Global Tranche Credit Exposures, net of any cash or cash equivalents on deposit in Prepayment Accounts) shall exceed the aggregate Commitments of such Class solely as a result of changes in Exchange Rates, then (i) on the last day of any Interest Period for any Eurocurrency Borrowing of such Class or any Contract Period for any B/A Drawing of such Class and (ii) on any other date in the event ABR Borrowings or Canadian Base Rate Borrowings of such Class shall be outstanding, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay Loans and/or amounts owed in respect of B/As in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the amount required to eliminate such excess and (B) the amount of the Borrowings or B/A Drawings referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), as applicable;
provided
that if, on any Reset Date, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Exposures of
any Class shall for any reason exceed 107.5% of the aggregate Commitments of such Class, then the Borrowers shall, not later than the next Business Day, prepay one or more Borrowings of such Class and/or amounts owed in respect of B/As in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to eliminate such excess (after giving effect to any other prepayment of Loans or B/As (including deposits made to the Prepayment Account) on such day). For purposes of this paragraph, any excess of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures of any Class (in the case of Global Tranche Credit Exposures, net of any cash or cash equivalents on deposit in Prepayment Accounts) over the aggregate Commitments of such Class shall be deemed to result solely from changes in Exchange Rates if no such excess shall have existed at the time of and immediately after giving effect to the most recent Borrowing, acceptance and purchase of B/As or reduction of the Commitments of such Class.
        (c)   The applicable Borrower, or the Company on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall notify the Applicable Agent (and, in the case of a prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of such prepayment and (ii) in the case of an ABR Borrowing or a Canadian Base Rate Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;
provided
that, if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09(c). Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Applicable Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Except as otherwise required in connection with any mandatory prepayment, each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13. In the event any prepayment shall be made hereunder but the Borrower shall not have selected the Borrowings or B/A Drawings to be prepaid, the Administrative Agent shall apply such prepayment (i) first, to ABR Borrowings or Canadian Base Rate Borrowings, (ii) second, to Eurocurrency Borrowings and (iii) third, to the prepayment of amounts due in respect of B/As.
        (d)   Amounts to be applied pursuant to clause (b) of this Section or Article VII to prepay or repay amounts to become due with respect to then outstanding B/As shall be deposited in a Prepayment Account (as defined below). The Canadian Administrative Agent shall apply any cash deposited in the Prepayment Account allocable to amounts to become due in respect of B/As on the last day of their respective Contract Periods until all amounts due in respect of such outstanding B/As have been prepaid or until all such cash has been exhausted (and any amount remaining in the Prepayment Account after all of the respective B/As for which the applicable deposit was made have matured and been paid will be released to the Canadian Borrowing Subsidiaries). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
Prepayment Account
" shall mean an account established by a Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary with the Canadian Administrative Agent and over which the Canadian Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal for application in accordance with this paragraph (d). The Canadian Administrative Agent will, at the request of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, invest amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Account in short-term, cash equivalent investments selected by the Canadian Administrative Agent in consultation with such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary that mature prior to the last day of the applicable Contract Periods of the B/As to be prepaid;
provided, however
, that the Canadian Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
invest amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Account if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify the Canadian Administrative Agent for any losses relating to the investments so that the amount available to prepay amounts due in respect of B/As on the last day of the applicable Contract Period is not less than the amount that would have been available had no investments been made pursuant thereto. Other than any interest earned on such investments (which shall be for the account of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, to the extent not necessary for the prepayment of B/As in accordance with this Section), the Prepayment Account shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall be deposited in the Prepayment Account and reinvested and disbursed as specified above. If the maturity of the Loans and all amounts due hereunder has been accelerated pursuant to Article VII, the Canadian Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, apply all amounts on deposit in the Prepayment Account of any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to satisfy any of the Obligations of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in respect of Loans and B/As (and each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary hereby grants to the Canadian Administrative Agent a security interest in its Prepayment Account to secure such Obligations).
        SECTION 2.12.
    Fees.
    (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Lenders a facility fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily amount of each Commitment of such Lender, whether used or unused, during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates;
provided
that, if such Lender continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure of any Class after its Commitment of such Class terminates, then such facility fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which such Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any such Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof, and on the date on which such Commitments terminate;
provided
that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
        (b)   Each Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent or the Canadian Administrative Agent, as applicable, for the account of each Lender a letter of credit participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the later of the date on which the last of such Lender's Commitments under the applicable Tranche terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure under such Tranche, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.10% per annum (or any lesser amount that the Company and such Issuing Bank may agree upon from time to time) on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank for the account of such Borrower during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the last of the Commitments under the applicable Tranche and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, under such Tranche, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued under this paragraph through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the last of the Commitments terminates and any such fees accruing after such date
shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 30 days after written demand. All participation fees and fronting fees payable under this paragraph shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
        (c)   Each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary agrees to pay to the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the accounts of the Global Tranche Lenders (or the lending offices designated to accept and purchase B/As pursuant to Section 2.17(f)), on each date on which B/As drawn by such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary are accepted hereunder, in Canadian Dollars, an acceptance fee computed by multiplying the face amount of each such B/A by the product of (i) the Applicable Rate for B/A Drawings on such date and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Contract Period applicable to such B/A and the denominator of which is 365.
        (d)   All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent, Canadian Administrative Agent, or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, for distribution to the applicable Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
        SECTION 2.13.
    Interest.
    (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate, the Loans comprising each Canadian Base Rate Borrowing shall bear interest at the Canadian Base Rate and Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Swingline Rate.
        (b)   The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
        (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section, (ii) in the case of any other amount payable in Canadian Dollars, 2% plus the rate applicable to Canadian Base Rate Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section or (iii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans made in the United States as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
        (d)   Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph  (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan or Canadian Base Rate Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
        (e)   All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest on Loans denominated in Sterling and interest computed by reference to the Canadian Base Rate or the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Canadian Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Applicable Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
        SECTION 2.14.
    Alternate Rate of Interest.
    If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:
        (a)   the Applicable Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
        (b)   the Applicable Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans as Eurocurrency Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Applicable Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Applicable Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Borrowing Request that requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and the applicable Borrower may instead request an ABR Borrowing not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing and (ii) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion or continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars (except for a Borrowing by a UK Borrowing Subsidiary), as an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in any other currency, or if such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars and made by a UK Borrowing Subsidiary, as a Borrowing bearing interest at such rate as the Lenders and the Company may agree adequately reflects the costs to the Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans (or, in the absence of such agreement, shall be repaid as of the last day of the current Interest Period applicable thereto).
        SECTION 2.15.
    Increased Costs.
    (a) If any Change in Law shall:
        (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or Issuing Bank (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
        (ii)   impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London or Canadian interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement, Eurocurrency Loans or B/A Drawings made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participations therein, other than any Taxes which, in all cases, will be subject to indemnity only pursuant to Section 2.17;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or obtaining funds for the purchase of B/As (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to accept and purchase B/As) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
        (b)   If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing
Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), other than any Taxes which, in all cases, will be subject to indemnity only pursuant to Section 2.17, then from time to time the Company will pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
        (c)   A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender or Issuing Bank to determine such amount, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
        (d)   Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that neither the Company nor any other Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and delivers a certificate with respect thereto as provided in paragraph (c) above;
provided further
that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
        SECTION 2.16.
    Break Funding Payments.
    In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan to a Loan of a different Type or Interest Period other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow (including as a result of a return of funds to the Lenders under the last sentence of Section 4.01), convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.09(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment or deemed assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan or the right to receive payment in respect of a B/A other than on the last day of the Interest Period or Contract Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19 or the CAM Exchange then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) (A) with respect to a Eurocurrency Loan, the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan) or (B) with respect to a B/A, (x) in the case of an event described in clause (c) above, the face amount of such B/A minus the Discount Proceeds of such B/A and (y) in the case of an event described in clause (d) above, the face amount of such B/A minus amounts received as a result of such assignment, over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London or Canadian interbank market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such
amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Applicable Agent (who shall promptly inform the applicable Borrower of the contents thereof) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
        SECTION 2.17.
    Taxes.
    (a) Subject to all the provisions of this Section 2.17 and except as required by law, any and all payments by or on account of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes;
provided
that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
        (b)   In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes (not otherwise addressed in Section 2.17(a)) to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
        (c)   The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (except to the extent such penalties, interest or costs are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct by a Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or Issuing Bank, or by an Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent shall give the Company written notice of any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to be made hereunder with respect to which the Company has an indemnity obligation, but the failure of such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent to give such notice shall not limit its right to receive indemnification hereunder, except that a failure to give such notice will constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of the first sentence of this clause (c) to the extent penalties, interest or costs are incurred solely as a result of the failure to give such notice. Such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in seeking a refund or return of such payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
        (d)   As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
        (e)   Any Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower to whom a Lender has made a Loan is organized or resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, or any other jurisdiction with respect to which the Lender or Issuing Bank receives written notice of such exemption from the Borrower with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and such Borrower from any penalties, interest or other costs incurred by such Borrower solely as a result of the failure of such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent to comply properly with such documentation requirements.
        (f)    Each Lender or Issuing Bank, on the date it becomes a Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (or designates a new lending office), will designate lending offices for the Loans to be made and held by it and B/As to be accepted and purchased by it and Letters of Credit to be issued by it or in respect of which it holds a participation, and represents and warrants that, on such date (but without giving effect to any Change in Law after the date hereof), it will not be liable and the relevant Borrower will not be required to withhold or deduct for any withholding tax that is imposed (i) by the United States of America on payments by the Company or any US Borrowing Subsidiary, (ii) by Canada on payments by any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, or (iii) by the United Kingdom on payments from the United Kingdom by any UK Borrowing Subsidiary, in each case except if such Lender (or assignor, if any) was, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), unable to comply with this Section 2.17(f) because of a change in applicable law (and would have been able to comply on the date that the applicable Lender or assignor became a Lender hereunder). Each Lender and Issuing Bank shall provide documentation to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.17(e)) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company to establish the foregoing. If a Lender or Issuing Bank is unable to comply with this Section 2.17(f) because of a change in applicable law described above, the Lender or Issuing Bank shall provide the Borrower with (i) adequate information as will permit the Borrower to determine the applicable rate of withholding tax and (ii) any additional properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower which is necessary to make such withholding on a payment made hereunder. Each Lender or Issuing Bank shall indemnify the relevant Borrower for the full amount of Excluded Taxes paid or required to be paid by a Borrower on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any Loan Document as a result of the Lender's or Issuing Bank's, as applicable, failure to comply with this Section 2.17(f).
        (g)   If a Lender, Issuing Bank or an Agent (each a "
Finance Party
") receives a refund or credit in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.17 and, in the case of a credit, such credit reduces the Tax liability of the Finance Party and is in the good faith opinion of the relevant Finance Party both identifiable and quantifiable without requiring such Finance Party or its professional advisers to expend a material amount of time or incur a material cost in so identifying or quantifying, the Finance Party will pay over the amount of such refund or credit to the relevant Borrower to the extent the Finance Party has received indemnity payments or additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit);
provided, however
, that the relevant Borrower, upon the request of the Finance Party, agrees to repay the amount it received to the Finance Party within 30 days of such request, plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority (except to the extent such penalties or other charges are incurred solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the relevant Finance Party), if the refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or cancelled. Amounts payable to a Borrower under this clause (g) with respect to a refund received by a Finance Party will be paid to the relevant Borrower within 30 days of receipt of such refund by the Finance Party. Amounts payable under this clause (g) with respect to a credit realized by a Finance Party will be paid within 30 days of the determination by the Finance Party that the credit reduced the Tax liability of such Finance Party.
        (h)   This Section 2.17 shall not be construed to require any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
        SECTION 2.18.
    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
    (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursements of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time (unless a different time is specified under a particular provision hereof or thereof), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account specified in Schedule 2.18 or, in any such case, to such other account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify reasonably in advance of the date of the required payment in a notice delivered to the Company;
provided
that such payments shall be subject to the principles of Section 2.17(f) (substituting "Applicable Agent" for "Lender or Issuing Bank" and "account" for "lending offices");
provided further
that payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any Lender or other Person promptly following receipt thereof to the appropriate lending office or other address specified by such Lender or other Person. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan and all amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing or any LC Disbursement shall be made in the currency of such Loan, B/A Drawing or LC Disbursement; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by an Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.
        (b)   If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to any Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
        (c)   If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans, as applicable, of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing, participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon; provided that (i) if any such participations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
        (d)   Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry practices on interbank compensation.
        (e)   If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it to any Agent pursuant to this Agreement, then the Agents may, in their discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by them for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Agents until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
        SECTION 2.19.
    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
    (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such assignment.
        (b)   If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.17, (iii) any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any amendment or waiver of any Loan Document that requires the consent of all Lenders (or of each affected Lender, where such Lender is an affected Lender) and such amendment or waiver is consented to by Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments representing more than 66/% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments of all Lenders, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, but with the cooperation of the Administrative Agent, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee

3
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Global Tranche Commitment is being assigned, each US Issuing Bank, each UK Issuing Bank, each Canadian Issuing Bank and each Swingline Lender and if a US/UK Tranche Commitment is being assigned, each US Issuing Bank and each UK Issuing Bank), which consents shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
        SECTION 2.20.
    Designation of Borrowing Subsidiaries.
    The Company may at any time and from time to time designate any Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company, and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to such Borrowing Subsidiary, any B/A drawn by such Borrowing Subsidiary or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary shall be outstanding hereunder,
provided
that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Borrowing Subsidiary to make further Borrowings, draw further B/As and obtain further Letters of Credit under this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement or Borrowing Subsidiary Termination, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.
        SECTION 2.21.
    Additional Reserve Costs.
    (a) If and so long as any Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees, in each case in respect of such Lender's Loans, such Lender may require the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loans at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in Exhibit D hereto.
        (b)   If and so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements reflected in the Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of any of such Lender's Loans, such Lender may require the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Loans subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loans at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Loans.
        (c)   Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the relevant Lender, acting in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the relevant Loans, and
such additional interest so notified to the relevant Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loans.
        Each of the Borrowers represents and warrants to the Lenders that:
        SECTION 3.01.
    Organization; Powers.
    Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is applicable) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business, and is in good standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable), in every jurisdiction where such qualification is required.
        SECTION 3.02.
    Authorization; Enforceability.
    The Transactions are within each Loan Party's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or partnership and, if required, stockholder action. Each of the Loan Documents has been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party thereto and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and, in the case of obligations of UK Borrowing Subsidiaries, the time barring of claims under the Limitation Acts and the possibility that an undertaking to assume liability for or indemnify a person against non-payment of the UK stamp duty may be void.
        SECTION 3.03.
    Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.
    The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and (e) will not violate the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clause (a), (b), (c) and (d), to the extent that failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
        SECTION 3.04.
    Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.
    (a) The Company has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheets and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, certified by its chief financial officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the consolidated Subsidiaries (prior to the Combination) as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.
        (b)   The Company has heretofore furnished to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of Molson (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent chartered accountants, and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2004, certified by its chief financial officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Molson and its consolidated subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, subject to year end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.
        (c)   The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of the Company as of September 26, 2004, and the pro forma condensed combined statement of income of the Company for the period of four fiscal quarters ended September 26, 2004, prepared giving effect to the Combination Transactions as if the Combination Transactions had occurred on such date and at the beginning of such period, respectively, included in the Information Memorandum (i) have been prepared in good faith based on assumptions believed by the Company to be reasonable at the time made, (ii) were based on the best information available to the Company after due inquiry at the time made, (iii) accurately reflect all adjustments necessary to give effect to the Transactions and (iv) present fairly, in all material respects, the pro forma financial position, and results of operations of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period, as if the Combination Transactions had occurred on such date and at the beginning of such period, respectively (it being agreed, however, that the representation and warranty contained in this clause (c), insofar as it relates to information concerning Molson and its subsidiaries, is made only to the best knowledge of the Company).
        (d)   Except as disclosed to the Lenders or in a filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the date of this Agreement or in the press release of Molson dated October 28, 2004 with respect to an impairment charge that Molson has taken on account of its Brazilian assets and operations, since September 30, 2004, there has not occurred or become known any event or circumstance that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse change in the business, assets, operations or financial condition of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including Molson and its subsidiaries), taken as a whole.
        SECTION 3.05.
    Properties.
    (a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has good title to, valid leasehold interests in, or valid licenses of, all its real and personal property material to its business, except for defects in title that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
        (b)   Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business, except for any intellectual property the failure to own or license which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and the use thereof by the Company and the Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Section (other than subclause (vii) of such clause (i))), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Company, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans and principal amounts payable in respect of B/As then outstanding to be due and payable in whole or in part (in which case any principal amount not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans and of B/As so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest on the Loans and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately (except as provided above), without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; and in case of any event described in clause (h) or (i) of this Section with respect to a Borrower, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower.
        SECTION 7.02.
    CAM Exchange.
    (a) On the CAM Exchange Date, (i) the Commitments shall automatically and without further act be terminated as provided in Section 7.01, (ii) each Global Tranche Lender shall immediately be deemed to have acquired participations in the Swingline Loans in an amount equal to such Lender's Global Tranche Percentage of each Swingline Loan outstanding on such date and shall promptly make payment therefor to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.04(c), (iii) simultaneously with the automatic conversions pursuant to clause (iv) below, the Lenders shall automatically and without further act (and without regard to the provisions of Section 10.04) be deemed to have exchanged interests in the Loans (other than the Swingline Loans) and B/As and participations in Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit, such that in lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Loan, B/A and Letter of Credit in which it shall participate as of such date (including such Lender's interest in the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such Loan, B/A and Letter of Credit), such Lender shall hold an interest in every one of the Loans (other than the Swingline Loans) and B/As and a participation in every one of the Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit (including the Obligations of each Loan Party in respect of each such Loan and each Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 7.03 below), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender's CAM Percentage thereof, (iv) simultaneously with the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, the interests in the Loans to be received in such deemed exchange shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the US Dollar Equivalents, determined using the Exchange Rates calculated as of such date, of such amounts and on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to the Lenders in respect of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in US Dollars at the rates otherwise applicable hereunder and (v) immediately upon the date of expiration of the Contract Period in respect thereof, the interests in each B/A received in the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iii) above shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into the US Dollar Equivalent, determined using the Exchange Rate calculated as of such date, of such amount and on and after such date all amounts accruing and owed to the Lenders in respect of such Obligations shall accrue and be payable in US Dollars at the rate otherwise applicable hereunder. It is understood and agreed that Lenders holding interests in B/As on the CAM Exchange Date shall discharge the obligations to fund such B/As at maturity in exchange for the interests acquired by such Lenders in funded Loans in the CAM Exchange. Each Lender and each Loan Party hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any person that acquires a participation in its interests in any Loan or B/A or any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit. Each Loan Party agrees from time to time to execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans and B/As so executed and delivered;
provided
, that the failure of any Loan Party to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
        (b)   As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by either Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender on or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of an Obligation shall be paid over to the Applicable Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith.
        SECTION 7.03.
    Letters of Credit.
    (a) In the event that on the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit under a Tranche shall be outstanding and undrawn in whole or in part, or any L/C Disbursement under a Tranche shall not have been reimbursed by the applicable Borrower or with the proceeds of a Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Borrowing, each Lender under such Tranche shall promptly pay over to the Applicable Agent, in immediately available funds, an amount in US Dollars equal to such Lender's Tranche Percentage of such undrawn face amount or (to the extent it has not already done so) such unreimbursed drawing, as applicable, together with interest thereon from the CAM Exchange Date to the date on which such amount shall be paid to the Administrative Agent at the rate that would be applicable at the time to an ABR Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to such undrawn face amount or unreimbursed drawing, as applicable. The Administrative Agent shall establish a separate account (each, a "
Reserve Account
") or accounts for each Lender for the amounts received with respect to each such Letter of Credit pursuant to the preceding sentence. The Administrative Agent shall deposit in each Lender's Reserve Account such Lender's CAM Percentage of the amounts received from the Revolving Lenders as provided above. For the purposes of this paragraph, the US Dollar Equivalent of each Lender's participation in each Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than US Dollars shall be the amount in US Dollars determined by the Administrative Agent to be required in order for the Administrative Agent to purchase currency in the applicable Alternative Currency in an amount sufficient to enable it to deposit the actual amount of such participation in such undrawn Letter of Credit in the applicable Alternative Currency in such Lender's Reserve Account. The Administrative Agent shall have sole dominion and control over each Reserve Account, and the amounts deposited in each Reserve Account shall be held in such Reserve Account until withdrawn as provided below in this Section. The Administrative Agent shall maintain records enabling it to determine the amounts paid over to it and deposited in the Reserve Accounts in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amounts on deposit in respect of each Letter of Credit attributable to each Lender's CAM Percentage. The amounts held in each Lender's Reserve Account shall be held as a reserve against the LC Exposures, shall be the property of such Lender, shall not constitute Loans to or give rise to any claim of or against any Loan Party and shall not give rise to any obligation on the part of any Borrower to pay interest to such Lender, it being agreed that the reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit shall arise only at such times as drawings are made thereunder, as provided in Section 2.05.
        (b)   In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any drawing shall be made in respect of a Letter of Credit under a Tranche, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the applicable Issuing Bank, withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender under such Tranche any amounts, up to the amount of such Lender's CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment, deposited in respect of such Letter of Credit and remaining on deposit and deliver such amounts
to such Issuing Bank in satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Lenders under such Tranche under Section 2.05(d) (but not of the applicable Borrower under Section 2.05(e)). In the event that any Lender shall default on its obligation to pay over any amount to the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section 7.03, the applicable Issuing Bank shall have a claim against such Lender to the same extent as if such Lender had defaulted on its obligations under Section 2.05(d), but shall have no claim against any other Lender in respect of such defaulted amount, notwithstanding the exchange of interests in the applicable Borrower's reimbursement obligations pursuant to Section 7.02. Each other Lender shall have a claim against such defaulting Lender for any damages sustained by it as a result of such default, including, in the event that such Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, its CAM Percentage of the defaulted amount.
        (c)   In the event that after the CAM Exchange Date any Letter of Credit shall expire undrawn, the Administrative Agent shall withdraw from the Reserve Account of each Lender the amount remaining on deposit therein in respect of such Letter of Credit and distribute such amount to such Lender.
        (d)   With the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld), any Lender may withdraw the amount held in its Reserve Account in respect of the undrawn amount of any Letter of Credit. Any Lender making such a withdrawal shall be unconditionally obligated, in the event there shall subsequently be a drawing under such Letter of Credit, to pay over to the Administrative Agent, in the currency in which such drawing is denominated, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, on demand, its CAM Percentage of such drawing or payment.
        (e)   Pending the withdrawal by any Lender of any amounts from its Reserve Account as contemplated by the above paragraphs, the Administrative Agent will, at the direction of such Lender and subject to such rules as the Administrative Agent may prescribe for the avoidance of inconvenience, invest such amounts in Permitted Investments. Each Lender that has not withdrawn its amounts in its Reserve Account as provided in paragraph (f) above shall have the right, at intervals reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent, to withdraw the earnings on investments so made by the Administrative Agent with amounts in its Reserve Account and to retain such earnings for its own account.
        In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
        Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or
otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
        The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
        The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
        The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
        In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
        Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Agents and the Lenders.
        Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.
        In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Persons named in the heading of this Agreement are hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent and Canadian Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks. Each of the Lenders, each assignee of any Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agents to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee or Issuing Bank and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Agents by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent and, to the extent expressly provided herein, the Canadian Administrative Agent are hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender or Issuing Bank its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Company of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Company or any other Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement in the event that all the capital stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement.
        With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, each Agent in its individual capacity and not as Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent.
        The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise upon receipt of notice in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances provided in Section 10.02) and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and no Agent shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by a Borrower, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
        Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and in good faith believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel
(who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
        Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
        In taking any discretionary action hereunder, or in determining whether any provision hereof is applicable to any event, transaction or circumstance, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be required (unless required by any other express provision hereof) to, communicate such proposed action or determination to the Lenders prior to taking or making the same, and shall be entitled (subject to any otherwise applicable requirement of Section 10.02(b)), in the absence of any contrary communication received from any Lender within a reasonable period of time specified in such communication from the Administrative Agent, to assume that such proposed action or determination is satisfactory to such Lender.
        Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Company shall have the right, with the consent of the Required Lenders (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor;
provided
, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Lenders, and not the Company, shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint such successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or Toronto or London, as applicable, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
        Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
        It is agreed that the Syndication Agent shall, in its capacity as such, have no duties or responsibilities under this Agreement.

        SECTION 10.02.
    Waivers; Amendments.
    (a) No failure or delay by any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
        (b)   Except as provided in Section 2.09(e), none of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that, except as expressly contemplated by Section 2.09(e), no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, any amount payable in respect of any B/A or any LC Disbursement or reduce the Applicable Rate, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount, (iii) postpone the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Loan, any amount payable in respect of any B/A or any LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such scheduled payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount or which holds such Commitment, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, or amend the pro rata treatment of each reduction of the Commitments under Section 2.09(c), without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or reduce the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release the Company or all or substantially all the Subsidiary Guarantors from its or their obligations under Article VIII or the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) change any provisions of Section 7.02 or 7.03 without the written consent of each Lender, or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those of Lenders holding Loans of any other Class without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely affected Class;
provided further
that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any Agent, an Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Global Tranche Lenders (but not the US/UK Tranche Lenders) or the US/UK Tranche Lenders (but not the Global Tranche Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Company and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders.
        SECTION 10.03.
    Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
    (a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agents and their Affiliates (including with respect to legal fees, the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP only), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Banks in connection with the amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent, Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of any counsel for any Agent or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with any Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made, Letters of Credit issued or the B/As accepted and purchased, hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.
        (b)   The Company shall indemnify each Agent, Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "
Indemnitee
") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all actual out-of-pocket losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, other than Taxes which, in all cases, are subject to indemnity only pursuant to Section 2.17, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Loan, B/A or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is instituted by a third party or by the Borrower or any Loan Party);
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties.
        (c)   To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum
of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments at the time (or most recently prior to such time).
        (d)   To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, the Agents and the Lenders shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
        (e)   All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
        SECTION 10.04.
    Successors and Assigns.
    (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender thereto (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby (including any Affiliate of an Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), the Related Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
        (b)   Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it);
provided
that (i) the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders (in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Global Tranche Commitment), the US Issuing Banks (in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Global Tranche Commitment or a US/UK Tranche Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its Global Tranche LC Exposure or US/UK Tranche LC Exposure), the Canadian Issuing Bank (in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Global Tranche Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its Global Tranche LC Exposure) and the UK Issuing Bank (in the case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Global Tranche Commitment or US/UK Tranche Commitment or any Lender's obligations in respect of its Global Tranche LC Exposure or US/UK Tranche LC Exposure)) and, except in the case of an assignment (A) to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or (B) at a time when an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), (b), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing, the Company must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which consent of the Administrative Agent and the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (it being understood that such fee is not payable by the Company), (iv) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and the documentation required to be delivered under Sections 2.17(e) and (f) and (v) no assignee shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.17 than the assigning Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the assigned interest unless the entitlement to receive any additional amounts under
Section 2.17 arises as a result of a change in applicable law after the date such assignee becomes a party to this Agreement. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
        (c)   The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of each Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of and interest on the Loans, amounts in respect of B/As and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "
Register
"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
        (d)   Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
        (e)   Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or any Agent, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "
Participant
") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender entitled to such benefits and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
        (f)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Sections 2.17(e), (f) and (g) as though it were a Lender.
        (g)   Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
        (h)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "
Granting Bank
") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "
SPC
") of such Granting Bank, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.01;
provided
that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall be deemed to utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Bank and such Granting Bank shall for all purposes remain the Lender of record hereunder. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Bank makes such payment. No SPC (or any Person receiving a payment through such SPC) shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 (or any other increased costs protection provision) than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the interests transferred to such SPC. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.04 other than Section 10.04(d), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (if consented to by the Company and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans (but not relating to any Borrower, except with the Company's consent) to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.
        SECTION 10.05.
    Survival.
    All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties herein or in any other Loan Document and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any other Loan Document and the making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof.
        SECTION 10.06.
    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.
    This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any fee letters executed by the Company and the Administrative Agent or the Syndication Agent or any of their Affiliates constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. It is agreed that the fee letters referred to in the preceding sentence will remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement until the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all amounts owing hereunder. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
        SECTION 10.07.
    Severability.
    Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
        SECTION 10.08.
    Right of Setoff.
    If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
        SECTION 10.09.
    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
    (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.
        (b)   Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
        (c)   Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
        (d)   Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
        SECTION 10.10.
    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
    EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
        SECTION 10.11.

        SECTION 10.12.
    Confidentiality.
    Each Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, subject, if reasonably practicable, to prior notice to the Company, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) to the extent necessary for the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, (i) to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Company or any Subsidiary and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Company or
(h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section, "
Information
" means all information received from or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Related Persons or their respective business, other than any such information that is available to any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
        SECTION 10.13.
    Interest Rate Limitation.
    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "
Charges
"), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "
Maximum Rate
") which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
        SECTION 10.14.
    Conversion of Currencies.
    (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including any Borrowing Subsidiary) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
        (b)   The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "
Applicable Creditor
") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "
Judgment Currency
") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the "
Agreement Currency
"), be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Applicable Creditor against such loss, and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Applicable Creditor shall refund the amount of such excess to the applicable Borrower. The obligations of the parties contained in this Section 10.14 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.
        SECTION 10.15.
    USA Patriot Act.
    Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of each Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Borrower in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.
        SECTION 10.16.
    Interest Act (Canada).
    Whenever interest is calculated on the basis of a year of 360 or 365 days, for the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest which is equivalent to the rate payable hereunder is the rate payable multiplied by the actual number of days in the year and divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be. All interest will be calculated using the nominal rate method and not the effective rate method and the deemed reinvestment principle shall not apply to such calculations.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

        Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of March 2, 2005 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "

The Lenders have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Each of the Guarantors is a Subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of the Borrowers, will derive substantial benefits from the extension of credit to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to extend such credit. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Guarantee.
(a) (i) Each Guarantor (other than Company Guarantors, Canadian Guarantors and UK Guarantors) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of all the Obligations; (ii) each Company Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Company Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Company; (iii) each Canadian Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Canadian Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Canadian Borrowing Subsidiaries (other than its own Obligations as a Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary); and (iv) each UK Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other UK Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the UK Borrowing Subsidiaries (other than its own Obligations as a UK Borrowing Subsidiary).
        (b)   Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal
of any Obligation. Without prejudice to the Borrowers' rights to receive demands for payment in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
        SECTION 3.
Guarantee of Payment.
Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
        SECTION 4.
No Limitations, Etc.
(a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 20, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.
        (b)   To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor. The Agents and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been fully paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
        SECTION 5.
Reinstatement.
Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
        SECTION 6.
Agreement To Pay; Indemnity; Subrogation; Contribution.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Agents and Lenders.
        Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "
Contributing Guarantor
") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "
Claiming Guarantor
") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.
        SECTION 7.
Information.
Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of each of the Borrowers' and each other Loan Party's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Agents or any Lender will have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
        SECTION 8.
Notices.
All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 10.01 of the Credit
Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Company as provided in Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement.
        SECTION 9.
Survival of Agreement.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Guarantors herein and in any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and acceptance and purchase of any B/As, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Credit Agreement, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or B/A or any fee or any other amount payable under any Loan Document is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
        SECTION 10.
Binding Effect; Several Agreement.
This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each Guarantor and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any Guarantor without the approval of any other Guarantor and without affecting the obligations of any other Guarantor hereunder.
        SECTION 11.
Successors and Assigns.
Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of any Guarantor or the Administrative Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective permitted successors and assigns.
        SECTION 12.
Administrative Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification.
(a) The parties hereto agree that the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expense incurred hereunder as provided in Section 10.03 of the Credit Agreement.
        (b)   Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the other Indemnitees (as defined in Section 10.03 of the Credit Agreement) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all actual out-of-pocket losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (other than Taxes which, in all cases, are subject to indemnity only pursuant to Section 2.17 of the Credit Agreement), including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement in relation to such Guarantor or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to the foregoing agreement, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is instituted by a third party or by any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party);
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties.
        (c)   Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Obligations. The provisions of this Section 12 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or Lender. All amounts due under this Section 12 shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
        
SECTION 13.
Applicable Law.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
        SECTION 14.
Waivers; Amendment.
(a) No failure or delay by any Agent or Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 14, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Guarantor in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.
        (b)   Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into between the Administrative Agent and the Guarantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement.
        SECTION 15.
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.
        SECTION 16.
Severability.
In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby (it being understood that the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not in and of itself affect the validity of such provision in any other jurisdiction). The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.
        SECTION 17.
Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 10. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement
by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.
        SECTION 18.
Headings.

        SECTION 19.
Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that any Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
        (b)   Each of the Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section 19. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.
        (c)   Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 8. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
        SECTION 20.
Termination or Release.
(a) Subject to the reinstatement provisions of Section 5, the guarantee of a Guarantor hereunder shall be automatically terminated when all Obligations guaranteed by such Guarantor have been paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment under the Credit Agreement to lend to, or accept and purchase B/As issued by, any Borrower whose Obligations are guaranteed by such Guarantor hereunder. Subject to the reinstatement provisions of Section 5, this Agreement shall terminate when all the Obligations have been paid in full and the Lenders have no further commitment to lend or accept and purchase B/As under the Credit Agreement.
        (b)   A Guarantor shall automatically be released from its obligations hereunder upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company;
provided
that the Required Lenders shall have consented to such transaction (to the extent required by the Credit Agreement) and the terms of such consent did not provide otherwise.
        (c)   In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b), the Administrative Agent shall execute and deliver to any Guarantor, at such Guarantor's expense, all documents that such Guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 20 shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
        SECTION 21.
Additional Subsidiaries.
Pursuant to Section 5.09 of the Credit Agreement, each Significant Subsidiary (other than a Foreign Subsidiary that is not a Canadian Subsidiary, a UK
Subsidiary or a Foreign Subsidiary that Guarantees or is otherwise liable for the Senior Notes) that was not in existence or not a Subsidiary on the date of the Credit Agreement is required to enter into this Agreement as a Guarantor upon becoming such a Significant Subsidiary within 15 days of becoming a Significant Subsidiary. Upon execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and a Significant Subsidiary of an instrument in the form of Exhibit I hereto, such Significant Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor hereunder with the same force and effect as if originally named as a Guarantor herein. The execution and delivery of any such instrument shall not require the consent of any other Loan Party hereunder. The rights and obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the addition of any new Loan Party as a party to this Agreement.
        SECTION 22.
Right of Setoff.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Guarantor against any of and all the obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section 22 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.

The Guarantors have entered into the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make Loans and accept and purchase B/As upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Section 21 of the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries of the Company may become Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of this Supplement.

        SECTION 2. The New Subsidiary represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
        SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Supplement shall become effective when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts of this Supplement that, when taken together, bear the
