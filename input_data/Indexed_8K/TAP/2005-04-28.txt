Status and Responsibilities
.    
(a)
As we discussed, you will present the synergies and integration plan to the Company's Board at its May 11-12, 2005 meeting in Montreal. You hereby resign from your positions as a director, as Vice Chairman, Synergies and Integration, and from all other positions and employment with the Company and its related entities, as a representative of the Company, effective upon Board approval of the plan referred to in paragraph 2(c) hereof, and conclusion of the Board meeting,.
(b)
On May 31, 2005, your employment will end (the "Separation Date") and you will be entitled to:
(i)
salary continuation payments in the monthly amount of CDN$83,333.33 for a period of 36 months (such 36-month period, the "Salary Continuation Period"), regardless of subsequent employment;
(ii)
continuation of your insured benefit arrangements (excluding short-term and long-term disability) and perquisites as described in the schedule the Company has provided to you, through the earlier of (A) expiration of the Salary Continuation Period, or (B) end of the month in which you find new employment or commence self-employment; and
(iii)
a benefit under the Molson Companies Salaried Pension Plan and related Supplementary Retirement Income Agreement (collectively, the "Pension") calculated and payable at the end of the Salary Continuation Period as if your employment had continued through such date, a preliminary calculation of which has been provided to you.
        2.
    
Compensation and Benefits
.    
(a)
2005 Salary and Bonus
. Until your Separation Date, your current base salary will continue to be paid in accordance with normal payroll procedures. You will not be entitled to receive a bonus with respect to 2005.

Benefits
. You and your covered dependents will continue to be covered under the Company's personal benefit coverages (including, without limitation, medical, dental, life insurance and long-term disability benefits) applicable to active employees through your Separation Date, subject to your continued payment of all applicable employee contributions. Certain insured benefits and perquisites will continue after your Separation Date, as provided by 1(b)(ii) above.
(c)
Special Bonus
. In your capacity as Vice ChairmanSynergies and Integration, you have been responsible for establishing a plan to deliver the synergy savings that are critical to the shareholder value creation underlying the merger. That plan, to be delivered at the May 2005 Board meeting, is to have three components: (i) to put in place a committed synergies team with clear roles, accountabilities, and processes; (ii) to establish specific, detailed plan over
three years to achieve $175 million in annual cost savings, with individual plans representing 100% of the total target; and (iii) to set in place processes to monitor each plan. Provided that the plan you present to the Board meets or exceeds these criteria, you will be entitled to a CDN $2,800,000 bonus ("Special Bonus"), 50% of which will be paid on or before May 31, 2005, and the remainder shall be paid on May 12, 2006. The Special Bonus is not an "annual bonus" and, as a result, shall not be taken into account as creditable earnings in the determination of your Pension.

Any compensation and benefits provided to you under Sections 1 and 2 that are in addition to the compensation and benefits you otherwise would be entitled to in the absence of this letter agreement (the "Transition Compensation") are in consideration of your promises and obligations you have under this letter agreement and are subject to your satisfying all of your obligations under this letter agreement.

DENVER, Colorado and MONTREAL, Canada, April 28, 2005
Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE and TSX: TAP) today announced that Daniel J. O'Neill, Vice-chairman, Synergies and Integration and formerly President and CEO of Molson Inc., has chosen to leave the company May 31 of this year. Mr. O'Neill's decision to leave the company is based on his completion of the merger synergies plan and strategies work.
        "Dan has done an outstanding job. He has devised a master plan to deliver on the synergies that made this merger so promising," said Leo Kiely, CEO of Molson Coors. "He has marshaled the team and, with Cathy Noonan, set the benchmarks for delivering the synergies plan. His contribution to the success of the merger has been exceptional."
        "I am satisfied that I have delivered on the synergies commitment and I am leaving the company in good hands and with a bright future," said Mr. O'Neill. "The merger teams have been working for nearly a year to plan, identify, and organize the synergies. More importantly, the global synergies team has taken ownership of the plan and is driven to implement it successfully. He added, "I have been proud to lead the charge and to create a strong, effective synergies team that will now be led by Cathy Noonan."
        Molson Coors appointed Cathy Noonan to the position of Global Chief Synergies Officer, reporting to Daniel J. O'Neill, in December 2004. Ms. Noonan will maintain her title and responsibilities, and will now report directly to Mr. Kiely.
        One of the strategic benefits to the creation of the Molson Coors Brewing Company was the immediate tangible benefit that could be derived through substantial cost savings in the areas of brewery optimization and consolidation, improved procurement practices, the elimination of duplicative overhead and the integration of technology platforms. Through Dan O'Neill's commitment to synergies delivery, Molson Coors has moved quickly to develop and finalize a detailed synergies plan. The plan has three components: the creation of a committed synergies team with clear roles, accountabilities, and processes; a specific, detailed plan over three years to achieve $175 million in annual cost savings; and processes to monitor the timely delivery of the plan.
        Molson Coors Brewing Company is the fifth largest brewer in the world. It sells its products in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia. Molson Coors is the leading brewer in Canada, the second largest in the U.K, and the third largest brewer in the U.S. The company's brands include Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Carling, Kaiser, Coors, Killian's Irish Red and Zima XXX.

Exhibit 99.3
        DENVER, Colo.Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today announced higher consolidated net sales and sales volume for the first quarter of 2005 compared to the first quarter of 2004, but reported a net loss in the 2005 first quarter. The net loss was primarily attributable to lower sales volume in key markets versus a year earlier and special charges related to the recent Molson Coors merger totaling $40.7 million in the first quarter of 2005.
        The company's 2005 first quarter results include the business of Molson Inc. following the completion of the merger on Feb. 9, 2005, compared to the first quarter of 2004, which includes only the results of the former Adolph Coors Company. The company's reported consolidated sales volume and net sales increased in the 2005 first quarter compared to the first quarter 2004 due to the combination of the Molson and Coors businesses.
        For the 13-week first quarter ended March 27, 2005, the merged company reported net sales of $1.1 billion and sales volume of 8,094,000 barrels, or 9,497,985 hectoliters (HLs). The company reported a net loss of $46.5 million, or $0.74 per share, during the 2005 first quarter. Excluding special items, the company reported an after-tax loss of $5.1 million during the 2005 first quarter. (See the company's website,
www.molsoncoors.com
for reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure.)
        For a more meaningful view of underlying business trends, the company provided the following pro forma results by operating segment, based on comparable time periods that correspond to the
company's thirteen-week periods in both years reported, except for Brazil which uses the December to February period in both years (see Note 4):
Molson Coors Brewing Company Pro Forma Segment Highlights
Comparable basis, pro forma combined, U.S. GAAP
(1)
Canada includes former Canadian operations and volumes, less Molson USA results and volumes, plus Coors Canada results historically shared with the U.S. operations under joint venture arrangements.
(2)
U.S. includes former U.S. operations and volumes, plus Molson USA results and volumes, less Coors Canada results historically shared with the Canadian operations under joint venture arrangements. U.S. now excludes the volumes and results from the company's Asia operations.
(3)
Europe includes former U.K. operations and volumes, plus the results and volumes from the company's Asia operations.
(4)
Brazil includes former Brazil operations and volumes for December through February in both periods presented. For financial reporting purposes, Brazil results will be reported one month in arrears.
        On a pro forma basis, the company reported a consolidated net loss of $79 million, or $0.91 per share, based on 86.2 million pro forma diluted shares outstanding during the 2005 first quarter.
        Leo Kiely, Molson Coors president and chief executive officer, said, "The common underlying cause for difficult first quarter results was the lack of volume growth in each of our major markets. While disappointing, this performance reinforces the importance of integrating the operations and organization of the combined company, so we can capitalize on our new strengths and build an even more competitive and profitable global enterprise."
        "Our synergy work is well underway, and since the completion of the merger on Feb. 9, we have taken major steps to establish our new leadership team. As we now head into our key selling season in our biggest markets, we are focused on driving volume and market share growth this summer."
Canada Segment
        Pro forma Canada segment net sales were $297 million, down from $303 million in the first quarter of 2004. Pro forma sales volume of 1,570,000 barrels (1,842,330 HLs) was down from 1,691,000 barrels (1,984,320 HLs) a year ago. Canada segment pro forma sales to retail were down 4.8 percent during the first quarter 2005 compared to a year ago largely due to declines in the overall market for premium brands such as Molson Canadian and Molson Dry. Coors Light sales to retail in Canada grew at a low-single-digit rate during the quarter. Canada segment pro forma pretax income decreased 44 percent in the first quarter of 2005 from the prior year.
        Kiely added, "We have a number of initiatives underway in Canada to regain volume momentum, including fully integrated marketing programs and strategies as evidenced by significantly increased investment in new advertising copy and product news, such as Molson Kick and Molson Canadian Sub Zero."
United States Segment
        In the first quarter 2005, pro forma net sales in the U.S. segment decreased 2 percent from the first quarter a year ago. The company's U.S. business faced continued softness in the beer industry, aggravated by increased interest in spirits brands, especially in on-premise channels. The company's U.S. business also faced significant cost pressures, primarily continued industry-wide increases in freight and packaging-material rates, as well as the de-leveraging of fixed costs due to the lower sales volume, partially offset by continued progress on cost saving and productivity initiatives in U.S. operations. Pro forma U.S. pretax earnings decreased 35 percent from a year earlier.
        Excluding a special charge of $7 million pretax, primarily merger-related costs, pro forma pretax earnings would have declined 3 percent to $23 million.
        "A slight decline in our U.S. sales to retail reflects weak industry volume conditions," Kiely added. "Nevertheless, we are heading into our peak season in the U.S. with a focus on regaining volume growth on Coors Light with continued success in key channels, such as our gains in chain accounts and improvements in Hispanic markets, new advertising copywhich has been well received among our U.S. distributorsas well as product and packaging innovations directed at adding focused excitement for the key summer selling season."
Europe Segment
        In the first quarter 2005, Europe segment net sales decreased 17 percent from the first quarter of 2004. Sales volume decreased 6.0 percent versus a year ago. Excluding special charges, the company reported a $7 million pretax loss in Europe for the 2005 first quarter.
        "The U.K. beer industry as a whole was impacted negatively by very weak consumer demand," Kiely said. "In addition, our off-trade business in the U.K. lapped a substantial inventory build in the first quarter last year in advance of an excise tax increase, and in the on-trade, our major competitors are responding aggressively with product entries in the 'extra cold' beer category due to the success of Carling Extra Cold.
        "Though, as in our U.S. and Canada segments, the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for our U.K. business, we are working to re-establish volume momentum with expanded distribution in key multiple on-trade accounts. We're also increasing distribution through entry into new markets, such as our recent introduction of Coors Fine Light Beer in Russia."
Brazil Segment
        Pro forma Brazil segment net sales during the first quarter increased 11 percent from the first quarter of 2004. Pro forma sales volume of 2,212,000 barrels (2,595,700 HLs) declined 7.1 percent versus a year ago. Sales for the portfolio's lead brand, Kaiser, which accounts for more than three quarters of the company's Brazil business sales, decreased at a low-single-digit rate. Excluding special charges, the Brazil segment reported a first quarter pro forma pretax loss of $18 million, compared to a loss of $16 million in the same period a year ago.
        "We are continuing a detailed assessment of our Brazil operations and are evaluating all of our options for the future of this business. Our evaluation of the Brazil business has focused on the health of the Kaiser brand, our ability to reduce overall costs and, consequently, our ability to significantly improve the profitability and cash flow of the business. Additionally, we are assessing the overall alignment with our key partners in Brazil. While this review is still underway, volume trends have improved somewhat over the past several months but are still negative. We will be reviewing the results with the company's Board of Directors in May, and we're committed to sharing more details with our stockholders as soon as our plans have been finalized."
Special Items
        The company's reported special charges totaled $40.7 million during the 2005 first quarter, including $7.4 million of merger-related special charges in the U.S. segment for restructuring costs and accelerated depreciation on the company's Memphis brewery, which will be closed during the next two years; a $3.6 million write-off of obsolete brewery assets in the Europe segment; and Corporate segment special charges totaling $29.6 million, primarily due to change-in-control payments and benefits for 12 Coors officers who elected to leave the company following the merger.
        The company's pro forma results include additional special charges totaling $43 million, including merger-related corporate expenses of $24 million, and $19 million in charges related to the closure of sales offices and brewing operations in Brazil.
