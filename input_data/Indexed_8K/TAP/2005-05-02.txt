Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On April 28, 2005, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") issued a press release setting forth its earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2005 ended March 27, 2005 (the "Earnings Release") and furnished the Earnings Release as part of a Current Report on Form 8-K.  The Company is furnishing this amended Current Report on Form 8-K to correct certain results reported in the Earnings Release and during the Company's related conference call held on April 28, 2005 (the "Earnings Call").
(a)
          
 
Excluding special items, the Company had an after-tax loss of $8.4 million (rather than the $5.1 million reported in the Earnings Release and referred to on the Earnings Call).  Excluding special charges, the Company had a pro forma after tax loss of $7 million, or 9 cents per share (rather than the $4 million, or 4 cents per share, reported on the Earnings Call).  A revised reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP measures has been posted on the Company's website to, among other things, reflect the changes described above.  A copy of the corrected reconciliation is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated into this Item 2.02 by reference.
 
In response to questions during the Earnings Call, the Company stated that the Company's net debt on a consolidated basis was approximately $2.75 billion to $2.80 billion.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Company's total debt net of bank cash balances on a consolidated basis was approximately $2.78 billion as of April 27, 2005.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The company's pro forma results include additional special charges totaling $43 million, including merger-related corporate expenses of $24 million, and $19 million in charges related to the closure of sales offices and brewing operations in Brazil.
