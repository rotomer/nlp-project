Item 8.01 Other Events.
        Beginning in May 2005, several purported class actions were filed in the United States and Canada, including in Delaware federal courts and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleging, among other things, that Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") and its affiliated entities, including Molson Inc., and certain officers and directors misled shareholders by failing to disclose first quarter (JanuaryMarch) 2005 U.S. business trends prior to the shareholder votes in January and February 2005 on the merger between the Company (then known as Adolph Coors Company) and Molson Inc. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and will vigorously defend them.
        The Company has been contacted by the Central Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Denver, Colorado (the "SEC") requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other information from the Company and Molson, Inc. relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related to the February merger, the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2005, and other information. The SEC has advised the Company that this inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred, nor should it be considered a reflection upon any person, entity, or security. The Company is cooperating with the inquiry.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
