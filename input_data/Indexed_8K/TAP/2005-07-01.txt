Taxes.
 
.  The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any and all payments made to the Executive all federal, state, local and/or other taxes or imposts which the Company determines are required to be so withheld from such payments or by reason of any other payments made to or on behalf of the Executive for his/her benefit hereunder.
(a)
                                 
Withholding Taxes
.  In the event any payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with the Executive's employment or termination thereof (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, or any person affiliated with the Company) (the "Payments"), are or will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed),
(b)
                                
Excise Tax
 
then, subject to the immediately following paragraph (ii), the Company shall pay at the time specified below, an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Payments and any federal, state and local income or other applicable tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph, shall be equal to the Payments.
(i)
                                    
 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing paragraph (i) to the contrary, the foregoing provision shall not apply (therefore no Gross-Up Payment will be made) and any amounts otherwise payable to Executive under Section 4(b) shall be reduced (but not below zero) such that no amounts paid or payable to the Executive under Section 4(b) shall be deemed excess parachute payments subject to Excise Tax, in the event the amount of such reduction does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total amount payable under Section 4(b). Unless the Executive shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Severance Benefits, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of such benefits which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination made by the independent public accountants selected under the preceding paragraph.  Any notice given by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive's rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation.
(ii)
                                 
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the Executive's highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the Executive's highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the date on which the Excise Tax is determined, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(iii)
                              
 
The computations required by this Section 7(b) shall be made by independent public accountants not then regularly retained by the Company, in consultation with tax counsel selected by them and acceptable to the Executive.  The Company shall provide the Executive with sufficient tax and compensation data to enable the Executive or his/her tax advisor to verify such computations and shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable fees and expenses incurred with respect thereto.
(iv)
                             
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder, the Executive shall repay to the Company at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive) plus interest on the amount of such repayment from the date the Gross-Up Payment was initially made to the date of repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code (the "Applicable Rate").  In the event that the Excise Tax is determined by the Internal Revenue Service or by such independent public accountants to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties, fines or additions to tax payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess if finally determined.
(v)
                                
 
Any payment to be made under this paragraph shall be payable within fifteen (15) days of the determination of the accountants that such a payment is required hereunder and, if applicable, within fifteen (15) days of such determination that the Excise Tax is greater or less than initially calculated but, in no event, later than thirty (30) days after the Executive's receipt of the Payments resulting in such Excise Tax.

Confidential Information; Confidentiality and Noncompete Agreement
 
The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all material proprietary information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.  In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 8 constitute a basis for denying, deferring or withholding any amounts or benefits payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
(a)
                                 
 
The Executive shall enter into the Confidentiality and Noncompete Agreement with the Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

.  In the event of any dispute between the Company and the Executive, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or otherwise, the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who shall be selected by the mutual agreement

Arbitration of Disputes and Reimbursement of Legal Costs
the Company and the Executive, unless the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, in which case, the arbitrator will be selected under the procedures of the AAA.  The arbitrator shall be experienced in the resolution of disputes under employment agreements or plans or programs similar to this Agreement maintained by major corporations and shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction, and the parties hereby agree to the emergency procedures of the AAA.  However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved.  Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Executive.  The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, or if applicable, the metropolitan area in which the Executive's primary office is located or was located immediately prior to Executive's Date of Termination.  In the event of any such proceeding, the losing party shall reimburse the prevailing party upon entry of a final award resolving the subject of the dispute for all reasonable legal expenses incurred, unless the arbitrator determines that to do so would be unjust; provided, however, that after a change in control (as defined in the Company's Executive Continuity and Protection Program) has occurred, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the Company and, unless the arbitrator determines that the Executive did not have a reasonable basis for his position with respect to the dispute in question, the Company shall also reimburse the Executive for his reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred with respect to such claim.  Otherwise, each party shall be responsible for its own expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and shall share the fees of the AAA equally.

Termination of Employment
 
.
(a)
                                 
Death or Disability
 
The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
(i)
                                    
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has occurred during the Employment Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement of its intention to terminate the Executive's employment.  In such event, the Executive's employment with the Company shall terminate effective on the 30th day after receipt of such notice by the Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"); provided that, within the thirty (30) days after such receipt, the Executive shall not have returned to full-time performance of the Executive's duties.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" shall mean the absence of the Executive from the Executive's duties with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 consecutive days as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness which is determined to be a disability pursuant to the Company's then existing long term disability plan or, in the absence of such a plan, a disability determined to be total and permanent by a physician selected by the Company and acceptable to the Executive or the Executive's legal representative.
(ii)

(i)
                                    
 
a determination by the Board that Executive has (A) willfully and continuously failed to perform substantially the Executive's duties (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties, (B) engaged in illegal conduct, an act of dishonesty or gross misconduct injurious to the Company, or (C) knowingly violated a material requirement of the Company's code of conduct or his fiduciary duty to the Company.
(ii)
                                 
 
For purposes of this provision, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or based upon the advice of counsel for the company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith determination of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii)(A), (B) or (C) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

(c)
                                 
Good Reason
 
a demotion or diminution in rank, title, responsibility or authority, the assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by Section 2(a) of this Agreement, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice thereof given by the Executive;
(i)
                                    
 
any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 2(b) of this Agreement, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company within ten (10) days after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
(ii)
                                 
 
any purported termination by the Company of the Executive's employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement;

The Executive must notify the Company of any event constituting Good Reason within sixty (60) days following the Executive's knowledge of its existence or such event shall not constitute Good Reason under this Agreement.
 
.  The Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company without Cause or by the Executive without Good Reason at any time.
(d)
                                
Termination Without Cause or Without Good Reason
 
.  Any termination by the Company or the Executive shall be communicated by Notice of Termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 12(b) of this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination" means a written notice which (i) indicates the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, (ii) to the extent applicable, sets forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of the Executive's employment under the provision so indicated and (iii) if the Date of Termination (as defined below) is other than the date of receipt of such notice, specifies the termination date (which date shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice).  The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executive's or the Company's rights hereunder.
(e)

Accrued Obligations shall be paid to the Executive or Executive's estate or beneficiary, as applicable, in a lump sum in cash within thirty (30) days of the Date of Termination.  In addition, the Retention Award shall become fully vested as of such Date of Termination.
(a)

(B)
                               
 
the amount equal to the amount by which the (1) product of (x) three and (y) the sum of the Executive's Annual Base Salary and his Target Bonus, exceeds (2) the value of the Retention Award, which for this purpose shall be determined by reference to the value of the Award on the date of grant;
(C)
                               
 
the amount equal to the product of (1) three and (2) 25% of the Executive's Annual Base Salary (which amount is in lieu of continuing employee benefits and perquisites (provided that Executive and his dependents shall retain rights to any Accrued Obligations and to elect and maintain COBRA coverage)).
(D)
                              
With respect to any options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (including the Retention Award) or other stock-based awards held by the Executive under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan, or any successor plan, on the Date of Termination all restrictions on awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units and other stock-based awards (other than stock options) will be canceled and such awards shall vest, and all outstanding stock options that have not fully vested, shall vest and become immediately exercisable, in each case only to the extent such awards were scheduled to become vested and exercisable during the 36-month period following the Date of Termination; provided, that with respect to any stock options, the options shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the option term or (y) one (1) year after the Date of Termination; and provided further that any portion of any such awards that remains unvested after application of the preceding provisions of this paragraph (c) shall be forfeited as of the Date of Termination and shall not thereafter become vested or exercisable.

(c)
                                 
Condition Precedent to Receipt of Payments or Benefits under the Program
 
.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and for which the Executive may qualify, nor, subject to Section 1(a), shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies.  Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, policy, practice, or program of or any contract or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliated companies at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, policy, practice or program or contract or agreement except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.
6.
                                     
Full Settlement
 
7.
                                     
Taxes.
 
.  The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any and all payments made to the Executive all federal, state, local and/or other taxes or imposts
(a)
                                 
Withholding Taxes
which the Company determines are required to be so withheld from such payments or by reason of any other payments made to or on behalf of the Executive for his/her benefit hereunder.
 
.  In the event any payments or benefits received or to be received by the Executive in connection with the Executive's employment or termination thereof (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, or any person affiliated with the Company) (the "Payments"), are or will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed),
(b)
                                
Excise Tax
 
then, subject to the immediately following paragraph (ii), the Company shall pay at the time specified below, an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Payments and any federal, state and local income or other applicable tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph, shall be equal to the Payments.
(i)
                                    
 
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing paragraph (i) to the contrary, the foregoing provision shall not apply (therefore no Gross-Up Payment will be made) and any amounts otherwise payable to Executive under Section 4(b) shall be reduced (but not below zero) such that no amounts paid or payable to the Executive under Section 4(b) shall be deemed excess parachute payments subject to Excise Tax, in the event the amount of such reduction does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total amount payable under Section 4(b). Unless the Executive shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Severance Benefits, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of such benefits which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination made by the independent public accountants selected under the preceding paragraph.  Any notice given by the Executive pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive's rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation.
(ii)
                                 
 
For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the Executive's highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the Executive's highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Executive's residence on the date on which the Excise Tax is determined, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
(iii)
                              
 
The computations required by this Section 7(b) shall be made by independent public accountants not then regularly retained by the Company, in consultation with tax counsel selected by them and acceptable to the Executive.  The Company shall provide the Executive with sufficient tax and compensation data to enable
(iv)
                             
the Executive or his/her tax advisor to verify such computations and shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable fees and expenses incurred with respect thereto.
 
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder, the Executive shall repay to the Company at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive) plus interest on the amount of such repayment from the date the Gross-Up Payment was initially made to the date of repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code (the "Applicable Rate").  In the event that the Excise Tax is determined by the Internal Revenue Service or by such independent public accountants to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties, fines or additions to tax payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess if finally determined.
(v)
                                
 
Any payment to be made under this paragraph shall be payable within fifteen (15) days of the determination of the accountants that such a payment is required hereunder and, if applicable, within fifteen (15) days of such determination that the Excise Tax is greater or less than initially calculated but, in no event, later than thirty (30) days after the Executive's receipt of the Payments resulting in such Excise Tax.
(vi)

The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all material proprietary information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).  After termination of the Executive's employment with the Company, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.  In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 8 constitute a basis for denying, deferring or withholding any amounts or benefits payable to the Executive under this Agreement.
(a)
                                 
 
The Executive shall enter into the Confidentiality and Noncompete Agreement with the Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.
(b)
                                
 
.  In the event of any dispute between the Company and the Executive, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or otherwise, the Executive and the Company hereby agree that such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")

Arbitration of Disputes and Reimbursement of Legal Costs
in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Company and the Executive, unless the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, in which case, the arbitrator will be selected under the procedures of the AAA.  The arbitrator shall be experienced in the resolution of disputes under employment agreements or plans or programs similar to this Agreement maintained by major corporations and shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction, and the parties hereby agree to the emergency procedures of the AAA.  However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved.  Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Executive.  The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, or if applicable, the metropolitan area in which the Executive's primary office is located or was located immediately prior to Executive's Date of Termination.  In the event of any such proceeding, the losing party shall reimburse the prevailing party upon entry of a final award resolving the subject of the dispute for all reasonable legal expenses incurred, unless the arbitrator determines that to do so would be unjust; provided, however, that after a change in control (as defined in the Company's Executive Continuity and Protection Program) has occurred, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the Company and, unless the arbitrator determines that the Executive did not have a reasonable basis for his position with respect to the dispute in question, the Company shall also reimburse the Executive for his reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred with respect to such claim.  Otherwise, each party shall be responsible for its own expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and shall share the fees of the AAA equally.
