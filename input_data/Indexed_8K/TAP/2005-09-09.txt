Financial Statements
        Adolph Coors Company (Coors) and Molson Inc. (Molson) merged on February 9, 2005 (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, Coors changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company (the Company or MCBC). The purpose of this Current Report on Form 8-K is to present the following financial information: (a) Molson's historical financial statements (unaudited) for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003; (b) Molson's audited historical financial statements for the three fiscal years ended March 31, 2004; (c) our unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 and the year ended December 26, 2004 that gave effect to the Merger; (d) updates to the operating segment and debt guarantor financial statement footnote disclosures as well as corresponding updates to Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2004, which are due to the changes in segment reporting beginning with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the thirteen weeks ended March 27, 2005; and (e) updates to the debt guarantor financial statement footnote disclosures in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005. There was no effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented as a result of the changes in reporting.

Exhibit 99.1
        Adolph Coors Company (Coors) and Molson Inc. (Molson) merged on February 9, 2005 (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, Coors changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company (the Company or MCBC).
        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and notes are presented to give effect to the Merger and represent the combined company's unaudited pro forma statements of operations for the year ended December 26, 2004 and the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005. A pro forma balance sheet is not presented as the Merger is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 26, 2005 filed in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for that quarter.
        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give effect to the Merger as if it occurred on December 29, 2003, the first day of Coors' fiscal year ended December 26, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations include adjustments directly attributable to the Merger. The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that are factually supportable. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the transaction actually taken place at the date indicated and do not purport to be indicative of future operating results.
        Molson's historical consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars and were prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which differs in certain respects from U.S. GAAP. Coors' consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are presented in U.S. dollars. As described in Note 3 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, Molson's historical consolidated income statements were reconciled to U.S. GAAP and were translated from Cdn.$ to U.S.$. As presented in Note 3 to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, pro forma adjustments have been made to the income statements of Molson to conform with Coors' presentation under U.S. GAAP. Molson's historical consolidated results for the thirty-nine days ended February 8, 2005 include the results of the Brazil operations for December 2004 through February 8, 2005 as the operations are reported one month in arrears.
        The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 26, 2004 is based on historical financial statements. Molson's fiscal year ends on March 31, while Coors' fiscal year ended on the last Sunday of December. As described in Note 1 to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations, the period covered by Molson's historical financial information has been adjusted to more closely correspond to Coors' fiscal year-end in the accompanying pro forma condensed combined statements of operations. Molson's historical financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 included in Note 3 below represent Molson's historical fiscal year ends. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not purport to represent the combined company's results of operations had the merger transaction between Molson and Coors actually occurred as of these dates or the results that the combined company would have achieved after the merger transaction. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements (and notes) of Molson and Coors.
        Unless otherwise stated, all amounts shown in this Exhibit 99.1 are in U.S.$ and in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was prepared using the purchase method of accounting, with Coors treated as the "acquiror" for accounting purposes. Although the Molson shareholders received more shares in the combined company than Coors shareholders, a voting trust provides equal contractual voting control of MCBC by the Coors and Molson families. Coors was determined to be the "acquiror" for accounting purposes since it was the entity issuing shares in the combination, effectively paid a premium through the special dividend, and based on an evaluation of other qualitative factors, including senior management positions and the relative sizes of the companies.
Preliminary Purchase Accounting
        The Merger's equity consideration was valued at U.S.$3.6 billion, including the exchange of 46.7 million equivalent shares of stock at a market price of U.S.$75.25 per share, the exchange of stock options valued at $4.0 million, and merger-related costs of approximately $35 million incurred by Coors. Since Coors was considered the accounting acquiror in the Merger, the purchase consideration is required to be allocated to Molson's net assets, with the residual to goodwill. The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations for many assets and liabilities. The most significant items for which valuations, and the purchase price allocation, have not been finalized are the Brazilian business, the guarantees related to the Montreal Canadiens, pre-existing contractual relationships between Coors and Molson, the fixed assets of Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI), a joint venture consolidated under FIN 46R, certain environmental liabilities related to discontinued operations, intangibles and income taxes. In addition, management is currently evaluating potential restructuring activities that could impact our purchase accounting. The significant outstanding items include evaluation of our organizational structure and decisions on outsourcing and other vendor arrangements. The value of the Brazil business presents a significant amount of uncertainty. Preliminary projections of future cash flows for this business indicate a book value of less than U.S.$200.0 million. However, increased perspective gained with regard to certain pre-acquisition contingencies, specifically certain Brazilian tax liabilities, could have a further negative impact on the value of this business.
        The final purchase price allocation, which will be determined in subsequent reporting periods, and its effect on results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts included in this section, although these amounts represent management's best estimates as of the date of this document.
1.    Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncement
        Adolph Coors Company (Coors) and Molson Inc. (Molson) merged on February 9, 2005 (the Merger). In connection with the Merger, Coors changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company (the Company or MCBC).
        These unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared based upon historical financial information of Molson and Coors giving effect to the Merger and other related adjustments described in these footnotes. Certain footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted as permitted by SEC rules and regulations. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the Merger actually taken place at the dates indicated and do not purport to be indicative of future financial position or operating results. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements.
        The Merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, with Coors treated as the "acquiror" and Molson as the acquired company.
        Molson's most recent fiscal year ended on March 31, 2004 and Coors' most recent fiscal year ended on December 26, 2004. Because these fiscal year ends differ by more than 93 days, SEC rules require that the reporting periods be more closely aligned for the purposes of pro forma financial information. For these purposes the consolidated results of Molson have been more closely aligned with Coors, as follows:
        The pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and the year ended December 26, 2004, have been prepared by combining the MCBC consolidated statements of operations for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and the year ended December 26, 2004, with Molson's corresponding financial information for the thirty-nine days ended February 8, 2005, and year ended December 31, 2004, respectively, assuming the Merger had occurred on December 29, 2003, the first day of Coors' fiscal year ended December 26, 2004. In addition, the Company is reporting the results of the Brazil operations one month in arrears. Therefore, the MCBC historical results for the twenty-six week period ended June 26, 2005 includes Brazil results for December 2004 through May 31, 2005. The thirty-nine day period results for Molson in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations includes Brazil results for December 2004 through February 8, 2005. And, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2004 includes Brazil results from December 2003 through November 2004.
        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect significant operational and administrative cost savings ("synergies") that management of the combined company estimates may be achieved as a result of the merger transaction or other one-time charges. Significant examples of omitted, one-time adjustments include:
 - 
Synergies associated with the announced closure of the Memphis plant, which are estimated to be between $32 million to $35 million annually when the closure is complete.
 - 
Expenses to be recognized in future periods associated with retention benefits to employees covered under change in control agreements, in exchange for forfeiting their rights under those agreements, totaling approximately $7.2 million.
New Accounting Pronouncement
        Molson and Coors were partners in two joint ventures, Coors Canada and Molson USA, prior to the Merger. EITF 04-1,
Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination,
requires management to determine whether the preexisting contractual relationships were at fair value at the Merger date. To the extent that these relationships are determined not to be at fair value, any difference would result in a gain or loss to be recorded in the Company's Statement of Operations. We are evaluating any potential impact of this guidance as part of our purchase price accounting process, which is ongoing.
2.    The Merger Transaction
        The Merger was approved at a special meeting of the shareholders of Molson on January 28, 2005, and a separate meeting of Molson option holders on January 27, 2005, and amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, special Class A voting stock and special Class B voting stock (and any shares convertible into or exchangeable for shares of that stock) were approved by the Coors shareholders on February 1, 2005. The Merger was effected through an exchange of stock, in which Molson shareholders received stock in the MCBC according to an exchange ratio, depending upon the type of stock held. Also, Molson shareholders were permitted to receive a combination of common stock of MCBC and exchangeable shares in a subsidiary of MCBC, Molson Coors Exchangeco. Canadian resident holders who received exchangeable shares in the Merger could defer paying income taxes on the transaction until such time as they exchange the shares for common stock or otherwise dispose of them.
        In the Merger, Molson shareholders received the following:
        Molson Class A Shareholders.
    A holder of Molson Class A non-voting shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.360 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Exchangeco (and ancillary rights), or
 - 
through a series of exchanges, 0.360 of a share of Class B common stock of MCBC, or
 - 
a combination of Class B exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of Class B common stock.
        Molson Class B Shareholders.
    A holder of Molson Class B common shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.126 of a Class A exchangeable share and 0.234 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Exchangeco (and ancillary rights), or
 - 
through a series of exchanges, an aggregate of 0.360 of a share of MCBC common stock, comprised of 0.126 of a share of Class A common stock and 0.234 of a share of Class B common stock, or
 - 
a combination of exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of MCBC common stock.
        Molson Stock Option Holders.
    A holder of Molson stock options was permitted to exchange each such Molson option for a 0.36 Molson Coors option to purchase Class B common stock. Approximately 1.3 million options were issued by MCBC in the Merger.
        Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders, excluding Pentland Securities (1981) Inc. (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party), also received a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") of Cdn. $5.44 per share, or a total of approximately Cdn. $652 million (US $523 million at then current exchange rates) paid by Molson in connection with the Merger to Molson shareholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2005. Included in the number of outstanding shares of Molson's common stock were approximately 1.4 million shares issued upon the exercise of options to purchase Molson Class A common stock by Molson's directors and senior management between January 28, 2005, and February 8, 2005. This resulted in an increase in the Special Dividend of Cdn. $12 million (US $10 million) and an increase in Molson's outstanding Class A common stock.
        At its January 28, 2005, meeting, in light of the amount of work involved in completing the Merger transaction, the Board of Directors of Molson authorized payments of: Cdn. $50,000 (US $39,800) to each of the then outside directors of Molson; Cdn. $50,000 (US $39,800) to the chairs of the Independent Committee and Human Resources Committee; and Cdn. $845,000 (US $672,630) in aggregate payments to executive officers and certain other employees of Molson. These expenses incurred by Molson were expensed as incurred prior to the Merger.
3.    Income statement information relating to Molson
(a)
The results of Molson have been translated into U.S. dollars at the average daily closing exchange rate of Cdn.$1.22 to U.S.$1.00 for the thirty-nine days ended February 8, 2005.

4.    Pro Forma balance sheet
        The combined Company's balance sheet as of June 26, 2005 is incorporated by reference to MCBC's Quarterly Form 10-Q for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005.
5.    MolsonU.S. GAAP Adjustments by Caption Heading
        The U.S. GAAP adjustments made to the Molson income statements, which are described in Note 6, are summarized, by caption, as follows:
6.    Descriptions for Molson U.S. GAAP Adjustments
        For details of the adjustments and the balances affected, refer to Note 5.
(a)
Stock options
        Under Canadian GAAP, Molson accounted for stock options using the fair value method whereby it recorded as compensation expense the fair value of all stock options granted. Under U.S. GAAP, Molson would follow Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Statement No. 25, which does not require the recognition of compensation expense when the option price at the date of grant is equal to the market price of Molson's shares. This adjustment reverses Molson's compensation expense related to stock options in 2004.
(b)
Capitalized interest
        Molson did not capitalize interest as part of the historical cost of constructing fixed assets. This is a requirement under U.S. GAAP. The capitalized interest adjustment capitalizes interest on qualifying project costs and records the incremental depreciation expense related to the capitalized interest.
(c)
Research tax credits
        Molson recorded its research tax credits as an offset to the expenses which gave rise to the credit. Under U.S. GAAP, research tax credits must be recorded as an offset to tax expense. This adjustment reclassifies the research tax credits into the tax expense line item.
(d)
Coors Canada
        Coors Canada was a partnership owned 50.1% by Coors and 49.9% by Molson. Molson recorded its investment in Coors Canada using a proportional consolidation method. Under U.S. GAAP, Molson would have been required to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"), beginning the three-month period ended June 30, 2004 and would have fully consolidated Coors Canada under this guidance as Molson would be considered the primary beneficiary. This adjustment consolidates Coors Canada's income statement for the nine months ending December 31, 2004. No U.S. GAAP adjustment to sales is required as Coors Canada receives an amount from Molson generally equal to net sales revenue generated from the sales of Coors brands by Molson, less production, distribution, sales and overhead costs related to these sales. Gross revenues generated from those sales are recorded by, and reflected in the historical income statements of Molson. In connection with the Merger, Coors Canada was dissolved.
(e)
Molson USA
        Molson USA is a joint venture owned 50.1% by Molson and 49.9% by Coors. Molson recorded its investment in Molson USA using a proportional consolidation method. Under U.S. GAAP, Molson would have been required to adopt FIN 46 beginning the three-month period ended June 30, 2004 and would have fully consolidated Molson USA under this guidance as Molson would be considered the primary beneficiary. This adjustment reverses Molson's proportional consolidation in the income statement for the three months ended March 31, 2004, and records the results using the equity method. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, this adjustment fully consolidates Molson USA's income statement.
(f)
Brewers Retail Inc.
        Molson records its investment in Brewers Retail Inc. (Brewers Retail) as an equity investment. Under U.S. GAAP, Molson would have been required to adopt FIN 46 beginning the three months
ended June 30, 2004, and would have fully consolidated Brewers Retail under this guidance, as Molson would be considered the primary beneficiary. This adjustment fully consolidates Brewers Retail's income statement.
(g)
Promotional discounts
        Molson records certain incentives as selling and marketing expense. Under U.S. GAAP, these amounts must be recorded as a reduction of revenues. This adjustment reclassifies Molson's promotional discounts to conform with U.S. GAAP.
(h)
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
        Under U.S. GAAP, Molson must follow Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 149. Under this guidance, the change in fair value of derivative contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting is reported in net income. This adjustment recognizes the related gains and losses as a charge to earnings in 2004. Adjustments for 2005 are insignificant and are omitted from the U.S. GAAP adjustments.
(i)
Pensions
        While U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP for post retirement benefits are essentially the same, the implementation dates of this guidance differed. As a result, differences arise related to the amortization of past service costs and net actuarial gains and losses. In addition, there is no requirement to record a minimum pension liability and no concept of other comprehensive income under Canadian GAAP. These adjustments record Molson's post retirement obligations in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
(j)
Stock appreciation rights
        U.S. GAAP requires that the change in fair value of stock appreciation rights attached to stock options outstanding be expensed over the vesting period. There were no stock appreciation rights attached to the stock options subsequent to April 1, 2002. On June 30, 2002, Molson cancelled the stock appreciation rights attached to stock options outstanding at this date, resulting in a new measurement date under U.S. GAAP, with the remaining value of the stock appreciation rights at that date to be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options. This adjustment records the additional compensation expense related to the stock appreciation rights.
(k)
Tax effect of U.S. GAAP adjustments
        The tax effect of all taxable U.S. GAAP adjustments was calculated using the Canadian tax rate of 33%. U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Brazil were tax effected at a 0% rate due to significant tax loss carryforwards. U.S. GAAP adjustments to Molson's historical income statement that are permanent in nature (e.g., reversing stock option expense) are not tax effected.
(l)
Deferred costs
        Under Canadian GAAP, certain expenses can be deferred and amortized if they meet certain criteria. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs are expensed as incurred.
7.    Pro Forma Adjustments
        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the merger transaction described in Note 2, as if it had occurred on December 29, 2003, the first day of Coors'
fiscal year ended December 26, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include any non-recurring charges that will arise as a result of the Merger described in Note 2. Adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are as follows (in U.S.$ millions):
        
A
     To adjust for retirement plan amortization expense that will be eliminated as a result of purchase accounting, which requires recording the excess of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets as a liability, thus eliminating amortization of previously unamortized liability balances. Expense reduction has been allocated 65% to cost of goods sold and 35% to marketing, general and administrative expenses.
        
B
     As described in Note 6 "d" and "e," Coors owned two joint ventures with Molson  Coors Canada and Molson USA  that were accounted for using the equity method of accounting by Coors. Coors was required to adopt FIN 46 beginning the year ended December 26, 2004 and determined that consolidation of its investments in Coors Canada and Molson USA was not required. Adjustment B reflects the consolidation of the Molson USA and Coors Canada joint ventures for all periods, as these would be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Molson Coors as a result of the merger transaction.
        
C
     The pro forma income tax adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements are composed of the following amounts:
         Items not tax effected include losses in the Brazilian operations as there is not sufficient certainty as to the future use and the income from consolidating the Coors Canada and Molson USA ventures under FIN 46 which is offset in the minority interests line item of the income statement.
         Pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations are tax effected at the combined U.S. federal and state statutory rate of 39%.
        
D
     The amortization of Molson's identifiable intangible assets (brand assets and distribution agreements) having finite lives is reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements. The combined company expects to amortize the estimated fair value of the identified intangibles with finite lives of approximately $489 million over estimated, useful lives ranging between 7 to 12 years for brand assets and Canadian distribution arrangements and approximately $32 million over an estimated 12 to 35 years for the Brazilian brand assets and distribution arrangements. In addition, Molson Coors expects to amortize the estimated $1,123 million fair value of Molson's tangible assets over an estimated, average useful life of 25 years for real property and 11 years for machinery and equipment. Upon finalization of all asset valuations, specific useful lives will be assigned to the acquired assets, and depreciation and amortization will be adjusted accordingly. The net effect of this increased amortization and
depreciation of $8.5 million and $70.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and the year ended December 26, 2004, respectively, is reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements as follows (in millions):
        For every $10 million of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles that could be reclassified to amortizable assets, as a result of the final valuations and completion of the purchase price allocations, the annual effect on amortization would be approximately $0.9 million based on a weighted average amortization period of 11 years.
        
E
     Represents amortization of debt premium of approximately $32 million resulting from recording assumed Molson debt at its estimated fair value based on public market quotes on the date the debt redemption was declared.
        
F
      Molson amortizes a deferred gain to revenues related to a previous merger's purchase accounting. This adjustment reverses the amortization benefit recognized in Molson's historical financial statements for pro forma purposes, as the amortization would no longer be recognized after the Merger.
        
G
     On February 8, in order to establish the fair value of its debt instruments for purchase accounting purposes, Molson announced its intention to redeem its $200 floating rate medium term notes, which were ultimately redeemed on March 2, 2005 for Cdn.$200.5 million. Molson also announced its intention to redeem its debentures, which were ultimately redeemed on March 18 for Cdn.$680.0 million. The redemptions of the floating rate notes and debentures were financed through a bridge financing facility provided by MCBC. Molson's reported results for the thirty-nine days ended February 8, 2005 include the expenses incurred to redeem Molson's debt securities. This adjustment reverses these expenses, for pro forma purposes, as they are non-recurring charges directly related to the Merger.
        
H
     Immediately prior to the Merger, Molson paid to its shareholders a special dividend of Cdn.$5.44 per share totaled approximately Cdn.$652 million (U.S. $523 million at then current exchange rates). The dividend was funded through debt, which has an average, floating interest rate of 3% currently. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements have been adjusted to reflect interest on this debt at this average borrowing rate. If the interest rate were 0.125% higher, or 3.125%, annual interest expense for the year ended December 26, 2004 would be $15.0 million, instead of $14.3 million. If the interest rate were 0.125% lower, or 2.875%, annual interest expense for the year ended December 26, 2004 would be $13.6 million, instead of $14.3 million.
        
I
      Results for the first half of 2005 for MCBC, as reported, include additional expense to record inventory at fair value totaling $26.5 million by the Company in purchase accounting. Because this is a non-recurring charge, we have reversed the expense for pro forma purposes.
        
J
      Molson's U.S. GAAP income statement includes expense related to the amortization of stock appreciation rights. (See Note 6j) This adjustment reverses the amortization for pro forma purposes, as all remaining amortization would be accelerated upon a merger and will not have an impact on the combined company.
        
K
     Brazil is subject to monetary variation interest expense related to certain tax contingencies in Brazil that existed at the time of the Merger. This adjustment reflects the interest expense that would have been recognized in 2004 under the Coors policy adopted in respect to monetary variation.
8.    Unaudited Pro Forma Income Per Share
        The following table sets forth the computation of unaudited pro forma basic and diluted income per share (in millions, except per share information):
        Other potentially dilutive securities, predominantly stock options, totaling 2.0 million and 1.2 million in the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and the year ended December 27, 2004, were excluded from the per share calculations above, because of their anti-dilutive effect.

EXHIBIT 99.2
Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies
        These interim consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, using the same accounting policies as outlined in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004, except as noted below. They do not conform in all respects with disclosures required for annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004 of Molson Inc.'s 2004 Annual Report. These financial statements differ in certain respects from those prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and do not provide all disclosures required in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These differences are described in Note 12.
Note 2. Change in Accounting Policies
        Effective April 1, 2004, the Corporation adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") Accounting Guideline 13 "Hedging Relationships", which establishes certain conditions regarding when hedge accounting may be applied. The relevant hedging relationships will be subject to an effectiveness test on a regular basis for reasonable assurance that it is and will continue to be effective. Under these rules, any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting will be reported on a mark-to-market basis in earnings.
        Effective April 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted, on a prospective basis, the CICA Handbook section 3870 "Stock-Based Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments". Effective April 1, 2003, the Corporation began to expense the cost of stock option grants, with a restatement of the prior period. The Corporation determines the cost of all stock options granted since April 1, 2002 using a fair value method. This method of accounting uses an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted and the amount is amortized over the period in which the related employee services are rendered. Opening retained earnings for fiscal 2004 was reduced by $3.7 reflecting the full year effect of fiscal 2003 stock option expense.
Note 3. Impairment Charge
        In the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the Corporation determined that the fair value of the Brazil intangible assets had decreased below book value. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $210.0 ($168.0 after minority interest) which reduced the goodwill by $130.0 ($104.0 after minority interest) and brand names by $80.0 ($64.0 after minority interest).
Note 4. Merger Related Costs and Provisions for Rationalization
        On July 21, 2004, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Adolph Coors Company ("Coors") to combine the two companies. As a result of the proposed merger, $8.0 in costs were incurred in the current quarter, $24.0 for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 and consist mainly of investment banking, legal and accounting fees. In addition, the Corporation recorded a charge for provisions for rationalization of $36.1, relating to the closure of the Queimados brewery and organization right-sizing including sales centres. The rationalization provision includes $24.1 to write-down fixed assets and $12.0 for severance, other closure costs related to the brewery closure and
the sales centre right-sizing program as well as an accrual for additional labour contingencies relating to previously closed breweries in Brazil.
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation recorded a charge of $43.3 relating to the closure of the Ribeiro Preto plant in Brazil represented by a $37.5 write-down of fixed assets to net recoverable amount and employee severance and other closure costs of $5.8. There is no remaining accrual.
        Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation completed a sale of a residual property adjacent to the Barrie brewery. A pre-tax gain of $7.0 was recorded in the provision for rationalization line in the statement of earnings which is consistent with the original Barrie plant closure provision.
Note 5. Earnings per Share
        The following is a reconciliation of the weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share computations for net earnings (loss):
        The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is based on the application of the treasury stock method. Under this method, the proceeds from the potential exercise of such stock options are assumed to be used to purchase Class A non-voting shares. During the current quarter of fiscal 2005, options to purchase 636,349 (fiscal 2004620,575) Class A non-voting shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise price exceeded the average market price of the shares in the three-month period. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004, no dilution impact was calculated due to the net loss incurred. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, 620,575 Class A non-voting shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Note 6. Long-term Debt
        The floating rate note program is an agreement under which the Corporation and the placement agent may agree to issue debt under terms and conditions that are only determined at the time of placement of the debt. As such, the Corporation's term loan and the $200.0 floating rate notes are classified as current liabilities. It is the Corporation's intention to refinance this debt with either a new term loan or through the medium-term note program or other facility. On October 19, 2004, the one year $50.0 floating rate note matured and was refinanced using the term loan credit facility.
        The Corporation had a $50.0 364-day revolving credit facility that expired on September 14, 2004 which the Corporation did not renew. There were no amounts drawn on this facility.
        On September 16, 2004, a third party bank exercised its right to cancel the interest rate swap which converted $100.0 of the Corporation's floating rate note maturing September 16, 2005 to a fixed
rate. The Corporation also has an interest rate swap for $100.0 which converted the Molson Canada debenture due June 2, 2008 with a fixed rate of 6.0% to a variable rate.
Note 7. Capital Stock
        The total number of Class A non-voting and Class B common shares outstanding at December 31, 2004 were 127,834,299 (127,282,671 at December 31, 2003) consisting of 107,977,477 (104,839,395 at December 31, 2003) Class A non-voting shares and 19,856,822 (22,443,276 at December 31, 2003) Class B common shares.
        For the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2004, and the three-month period ended December 31, 2003, the Corporation did not repurchase any Class A non-voting or Class B common shares. In the nine-month period ended December 31, 2003, the Corporation repurchased 751,000 Class A non-voting shares at prices ranging between $32.15 and $34.99 and no Class B common shares. In fiscal 2004, of the total amount of $24.6 repurchased, $4.2 was charged to capital stock based on the weighted-average stated capital with the excess of $20.4 being charged to retained earnings.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
        The Corporation has a stock option plan for eligible employees and non-employee directors of the Corporation, under which Class A non-voting shares of the Corporation may be purchased at a price equal to the market price of the common shares at the date of granting of the option. The options vest over a period of two, three, four or five years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant. At December 31, 2004, there were 5,716,380 (20035,090,750) stock options outstanding and 929,101 (20032,028,013) stock options available for future grants. During the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the Corporation granted, less forfeitures, 977,900 (2004855,725) stock options at exercise prices of $31.44 and $33.21 (2004ranging between $32.31 and $36.96).
        The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants during the nine-month period: dividend yield of 1.4% (20031.6%); expected volatility of 24.7% (200325.5%), risk-free interest rate of 4.2% (20034.4%); and an expected life of 6 years (20036 years). The weighted average fair value of options granted in the nine-month period is $8.84 (2003$9.29) per share.
        The Corporation has recorded $5.0 (2003$4.0) related to stock option expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2004.
        The Corporation's contributions to the employee share ownership plan ("MESOP") of $1.3 (2003$1.3) were charged to earnings during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004.
        As at December 31, 2004, 136,449 (2003161,371) Deferred Share Units ("DSU's") were outstanding. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2004, $0.8 (2003$0.4) was charged to earnings representing the accrual for services provided in the period which were paid with the issuance of DSU's.
Note 8. Segment Disclosures
        The Corporation's business is producing and marketing beer and other malt-based beverages. Its business units are located in three main geographic regions: Canada, Brazil and the United States.
        These segments are managed separately since they all require specific market strategies. The Corporation assesses the performance of each segment based on operating income or EBIT. Accounting policies relating to each segment are identical to those used for the purposes of the consolidated
financial statements. Management of interest expense and income tax expense are centralized and, consequently, these expenses are not allocated among operating groups. Inter-segment revenues reflect transactions made on an arms-length basis.
(i)
Includes the $8.0 merger related costs.
(ii)
Includes the charge for rationalization costs of $36.1.
(iii)
Includes $24.0 merger related costs and $2.2 charge for rationalization costs.
(iv)
Includes the $7.0 gain on sale of a property.
(v)
Includes an impairment charge of $210.0 and the charge for rationalization costs of $37.3.
(vi)
Includes a provision for rationalization of $43.3.
Note 9. Discontinued Operations
        Cash provided from discontinued operations of $0.6 ($7.2 use of cash in fiscal 2004) in the three-month period and cash used of $1.8 ($6.4 in fiscal 2004) in the nine-month period were used for operating activities.
Note 10. Subsequent Events
        In a special shareholder meeting held on January 28, 2005, Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders approved the merger with Coors. The merger was approved by the Coors stockholders at a special stockholders meeting on February 1, 2005. The effective date of the merger was February 9, 2005.
        Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common registered shareholders, excluding Pentland (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party), received a special dividend of $5.44 per share, or a total of approximately $652, in connection with the merger to Molson shareholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2005. The special dividend total included payment on 1.4 million Molson Class A non-voting, shares issued between January 28, 2005 and February 8, 2005, upon the exercise of options by certain Molson directors and senior management.
        In January 2005, the Corporation entered into a bridge facility in the amount of $250.0 for the purpose of paying the special dividend The bridge facility was refinanced with a credit facility of Molson Coors Brewing Company.
        On February 8, 2005, the Corporation announced its intention to redeem the floating rate medium term notes, which were ultimately redeemed on March 2, 2005 for $200.5. The Corporation also announced its intention to redeem the Molson debentures, which were ultimately redeemed on March 18, 2005 for $680. The redemption of the floating rate notes and debentures were financed through a bridge financing facility provided by Molson Coors Brewing Company.
        On January 28, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized payments totaling $1.3 to certain officers and directors and employees of the Corporation for services provided in connection with completing the merger.
Note 11. Comparative Figures
        Certain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current period's basis of presentation.
Note 12. U.S. GAAP Reconciliation
        The Corporation's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. The tables that follow are a reconciliation of the significant differences relating to the statement of earnings and total shareholders' equity reported between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP.
(i)    Employee future benefits
        The Corporation adopted the CICA Handbook Section 3461, "Employee Future Benefits" effective April 1, 2000 on a retroactive basis without restatement of prior year's financial statements. For the purposes of U.S. GAAP, the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" require essentially the same accounting treatment as Section 3461, except for the implementation dates of the standards, with the U.S. standards effective 1987. Based on these different transition dates, differences arise related to the amortization of prior service costs and net actuarial gains and losses.
        In addition, under U.S. GAAP, if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the market value of the plan assets, a minimum pension liability for the excess is recognized to the extent that the liability recorded in the balance sheet is less than the minimum liability. Any portion of this additional liability that relates to unrecognized prior service cost is recognized as an intangible asset while the remainder is charged to other comprehensive income. Canadian GAAP has no such requirement and does not have the concept of comprehensive income.
(ii)    Capitalized interest on property, plant and equipment
        Under U.S. GAAP, interest expense allocable to long-term capital projects during construction is considered part of the project cost and as a result is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. There is no such requirement under Canadian GAAP. For the nine months ended December 31, 2004 the adjustment for capitalized interest is expressed net of depreciation expense of $2.2 (2003$1.8)
(iii)    Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities (SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No.149)
        U.S. GAAP requires a company to recognize all derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, on the balance sheet at fair value whereas Canadian GAAP does not require derivatives qualifying as hedges to be presented in the balance sheet at fair values. For the purposes of U.S. GAAP, the Corporation has not applied hedge accounting for any of its derivative financial instruments. The change in fair value of derivative contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP is reported in net earnings.
        The fair value of the Corporation's derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 were $(5.1) (2003$(2.9))
(iv)    Stock option and stock appreciation rights
        Under Canadian GAAP, the Corporation accounts for stock options using the fair value method whereby it records as compensation expense the fair value of all stock options granted. Under U.S. GAAP, the Corporation follows APB No. 25 which does not require recognition of compensation expense when the option price at the date of grant is equal to the market price of the Corporation's shares.
        U.S. GAAP requires that the change in fair value of stock appreciation rights attached to stock options outstanding be expensed over the vesting period. There were no stock appreciation rights attached to options granted subsequent to April 1, 2002. On June 30, 2002, the Corporation cancelled the stock appreciation rights attached to the stock options resulting in a new measurement date under U.S. GAAP, with the remaining value of the stock appreciation rights at that date to be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options.
(v)    Deferred costs
        Under Canadian GAAP, certain expenses can be deferred and amortized if they meet certain criteria. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs are expensed as incurred.
(vi)    Variable interest entities
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board finalized FASB interpretation No.46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesAn Interpretation of ARB51 (FIN 46R) in December 2003 effective for the Corporation for periods beginning April 1, 2004. FIN 46R expands the scope of ARB51 and can require consolidation of legal structures, called "variable interest entities (VIE's)." Once an entity is determined to be a VIE, the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. The Corporation has investments in VIE's where management has determined that Molson is the primary beneficiary for purposes of FIN 46R.
        Accordingly, Molson was required to consolidate three entities, Brewers Retail Inc., Coors Canada Partnership and Molson USA, effective April 1, 2004. Results of operations and financial position from prior year periods are not being restated as a result of the adoption of FIN46R. Both Coors Canada and Molson USA are proportionately consolidated under Canadian GAAP. As a result of applying consolidation accounting, the following balance sheet items would increase as follows: Cash $56, accounts receivable $19, property, plant and equipment $223, accounts payable $40, long-term debt $200 and deferred liabilities $39.
(vii)    Joint ventures
        Under Canadian GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, while under U.S. GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. Pursuant to an accommodation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accounting for joint ventures need not be reconciled from Canadian to U.S. GAAP.
(viii)    Minority interest
        The minority interest adjustment represents the applicable impact of the U.S. GAAP adjustments on minority interest.
(ix)    Consolidated statements of cash flows
        U.S. GAAP requires inclusion of the financing activities associated with the securitization of accounts receivable as an operating activity.
        U.S. GAAP requires cash flows from discontinued operations to be reported in their respective activities as disclosed in note 9.
(x)    Deferred Gain
        U.S. GAAP requires the deferred gain amounting to $28.0 (2003$34.1) that is classified with deferred liabilities, to be presented as a reduction to the related property, plant and equipment.

Exhibit 99.3
To the Directors of Molson Inc.
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Molson Inc. as at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the years in the three years ended March 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
        We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
        In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the corporation as at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three years ended March 31, 2004 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

        In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph following the opinion paragraph when there is a change in accounting principle that has a material effect in the comparability of the corporation's financial statements, such as the changes described in note 2 to the Molson Inc. financial statements as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and for each of the years in the three years ended March 31, 2004. Our report to the directors dated May 5, 2004, except as to note 25, which is at July 21, 2004, is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards, which do not require a reference to such changes in accounting principles in the auditors' report when the change is properly accounted for and adequately disclosed in the financial statements.

1. Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
        The Consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (Canadian GAAP). These financial statements differ in certain respects from those prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and do not provide all disclosures required in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These differences are described in Note 24.
Consolidation
        The accounts of the Molson Canada partnership and all subsidiaries controlled by the Corporation are consolidated including its 80% interest in the operations in Brazil, which includes Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. ("Kaiser") and Bavaria S.A. ("Bavaria"). The minority interest accounts reflect the non-controlling shareholder's interest in the Corporation's operations in Brazil.
Joint Ventures and Other Investments
        The Corporation's 49.9% investment in the Coors Canada partnership and its 50.1% investment in Molson USA are proportionately consolidated.
        Investments in entities over which the Corporation exercises significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Other investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value provided any decline in value is other than temporary.
Use of Estimates
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Corporation may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from the estimates.
Inventories
        Inventories of raw materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value. Work in process and finished goods are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value and include the cost of raw materials, labour and overhead expenses. The cost of returnable containers in Canada is amortized over their estimated useful lives of four years and in Brazil the cost of returnable containers is charged to customers at the time of shipment.
Capital Assets
        Property, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of original cost less accumulated amortization and fair value, if the net recoverable amount is less than net book value. Ordinary repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Only those expenditures for improvements that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of a capital asset are capitalized. The cost incurred
for developing or obtaining internal-use software is capitalized. Training and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Amortization is provided from the date property, plant and equipment are placed into service on a straight-line method, principally at annual rates of 1.5% to 5% for buildings and from 2% to 33% for equipment.
        Intangible assets, which include goodwill, brand names and the distribution network access in Brazil are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. The carrying values of all indefinite life intangible assets are tested at least annually for any impairment, taking into account the ability to recover the book value from expected future operating cash flows on a discounted basis. The Corporation also considers projected future operating results, trends and other circumstances in making such evaluations. The only intangible asset with a definite life, namely the distribution network access in Brazil, is amortized over its contractual life of 40 years.
Revenue Recognition
        Revenue is stated net of incentives, discounts and returns. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer or distributor, which is either at the time of shipment to distributors or upon delivery of product to retail customers.
Foreign Currency Translation
        Earnings of self-sustaining foreign operations are translated to Canadian dollars at average rates of exchange during the year. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates. The differences between translating assets and liabilities at period-end rates and the exchange rates on the date of acquisition of those assets and liabilities have been included in shareholders' equity as unrealized translation adjustments.
Hedging Relationships
        The Corporation uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk exposures. The gains or losses on the derivative instruments used to hedge the Corporation's risk exposures are recorded in the financial statements when the contract is settled or the transactions are recognized. These gains or losses are included in cost of sales or net interest expense.
        The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") issued Accounting Guideline 13 "Hedging Relationships", which establishes certain conditions regarding when hedge accounting may be applied. The Guideline is effective for the Corporation's annual and interim periods beginning on April 1, 2004. The Corporation has prepared for the implementation of the hedging provisions. The relevant hedging relationships will be subject to an effectiveness assessment at least quarterly to determine that they are and will continue to be effective. Under these rules, any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting will be reported on a mark-to-market basis in earnings.
Income Taxes
        Future income tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the differences between the accounting carrying values of balance sheet assets and liabilities and the tax cost bases of these assets and liabilities based on substantively enacted tax laws and rates.
        The Corporation reviews the valuation of its future income tax assets and liabilities quarterly and records adjustments, as necessary, to reflect the realizable amount of its future income tax assets and liabilities.
Employee Future Benefits
        The cost of pension benefits earned by employees covered under defined benefit plans is determined using the projected benefit method prorated on service and is charged to expense as services are rendered. Adjustments arising from plan amendments, changes in assumptions, and experience gains and losses on the net pension asset are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average remaining service lives of the employee groups using the corridor approach. Defined benefit pension plan assets are reported at market values. The determination of pension expense is based on a five-year weighted average of pension plan asset market values. The cost of postemployment benefits other than pension benefits is recognized on an accrual basis over the working lives of employees.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
        The Corporation has a stock option plan and may grant options to acquire Class "A" non-voting shares. The fair value of the stock options is determined using a fair value pricing model and is amortized over the period in which the related employee services are rendered, being the vesting period. Consideration paid by employees on the exercise of stock options is credited to shareholders' equity as capital stock when the options are exercised (see note 2).
        The Corporation also has an employee share ownership plan ("MESOP") primarily for all full-time employees in Canada. Under this plan, employees are entitled to have a portion of their base earnings withheld to purchase the Corporation's Class "A" non-voting shares, with the Corporation providing funds to purchase additional Class "A" non-voting shares, to a maximum of 1.33% of base earnings. The Corporation's contributions are charged to earnings.
        The Corporation has a deferred share unit plan for the members of the Board of Directors. Under the terms of this plan, a portion of the directors' fees are paid to them in the form of deferred share units ("DSU"). Each DSU is equivalent in value to a Class "A" non-voting share of the Corporation and is notionally credited with dividends when shareholders receive dividends from the Corporation. A DSU is paid to a Board member after termination of service or retirement and is payable in cash. The cost of the DSU's is charged to earnings in the period earned and marked to market on a quarterly basis.
2. Change in Accounting Policies
        Effective April 1, 2002, the Corporation adopted, on a prospective basis, the CICA Handbook section 3870 "Stock-Based Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments". Effective April 1, 2003, the Corporation began to expense the cost of stock option grants, with a restatement of the prior period. The Corporation determines the cost of all stock options granted since April 1, 2002 using a fair value method. This method of accounting uses an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted and the amount is amortized over the period in which the related employee services are rendered. Previously, the Corporation accounted for stock options granted, including the related stock appreciation rights whereby the difference between the exercise price of the option and the market price of the stock was charged to earnings over the vesting period. Further details of the stock options outstanding are contained in note 17.
        The effect of expensing the fair value of stock option grants, with a restatement of the prior period, was to reduce net earnings for the years ended March 31 by $5.2 in fiscal 2004 and by $3.7 in fiscal 2003. Opening retained earnings for fiscal 2004 was reduced by $3.7 reflecting the full year effect of fiscal 2003 stock option expense.
        In fiscal 2003, the Corporation adopted, on a prospective basis, the CICA Accounting Guideline 14 "Disclosure of Guarantees". Under the guideline, the Corporation is required to disclose the nature, the maximum potential amount of future payments, the carrying amount of any liability, and the nature of any recourse provisions of all significant guarantees. Further details are contained in note 18.
3. Business Acquisitions
        On March 18, 2002, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kaiser, whose assets include the Kaiser brands and eight breweries in Brazil for $1,136.3 including transaction costs. The transaction was financed with a combination of cash, long-term debt and the issuance of US$150.0 (CAD$238.2) Molson Inc. Class "A" non-voting shares at a price per share of CAD$30.59, or 7,785,878 Class "A" non-voting shares. These shares must be held by the vendors for a minimum of two years. The operating results of Kaiser for the period March 19, 2002 to March 31, 2002 have been included in the fiscal 2002 consolidated results of the Corporation.
        In a separate transaction, which closed on April 17, 2002, Molson sold 20% of its operations in Brazil to Heineken N.V. for total proceeds of US$218.3, and a gain of CAD$64.2 was recorded in fiscal 2003. The minority interest recorded represents Heineken's 20% share of earnings from April 18, 2002 thereafter.
        The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method which includes the use of estimates in determining the purchase price allocation disclosed at March 31, 2002. The Corporation completed the Kaiser valuation analysis and purchase price allocation in fiscal 2003. Of the $1,247.8 intangible asset value, $325.0 was assigned to brand names, $35.0 to the distribution network access and the residual of $887.8 to goodwill. Only the distribution network access is considered to have a definite life and is amortized over its contractual life of 40 years. The amount of these intangible assets that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes as goodwill in Brazil is R$1,321 (CAD$896 as at March 18, 2002).
        The details of the Corporation's acquisition of Kaiser are as follows:
(i)
Working capital consists primarily of inventory of $55.0, accounts receivable of $67.5 and accounts payable of $109.5.
        As part of the acquisition, the Corporation integrated and reorganized its operations in Brazil including the closure of the Divinpolis brewery and the relocation of certain sales, marketing and administrative departments. The Corporation recorded provisions for employee severance, relocation, and other integration costs of $12.2 and these amounts were reflected in the purchase price allocation.
        The closure of the Divinpolis brewery was completed in fiscal 2003. The remaining relocation and integration costs at March 31, 2003 of $1.6 were incurred in fiscal 2004.
        Molson is currently engaged in a full strategic review of its Brazilian operations. The completion of this review will result in a new valuation based on past performance and future expectations of management of the Brazilian operations over the next few years. Molson intends to complete this review in conjunction with the release of its second quarter financial statements and reflect any changes, to the extent necessary, in those financial statements.
4. Investments in Joint Ventures
        The following information includes the Corporation's proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows of the Corporation's joint venture investments in Coors Canada and Molson USA, which are included in the consolidated financial statements.
        As at March 31, 2004, Molson USA had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts of which the Corporation's proportionate share is $5.8 (2003$20.7), which approximates fair value.
5. Provisions for Rationalization
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation recorded a charge of $43.3 relating to the closure of the Ribeiro Preto plant in Brazil represented by a $37.5 write-down of substantially all of the related fixed assets to a nominal amount and employee severance and other closure costs of $5.8. There is no remaining accrual at March 31, 2004.
        Also, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Corporation completed a sale of a residual property adjacent to the Barrie brewery with a nominal book value. A pre-tax gain of $7.0 was recorded in the provisions for rationalization line in the statement of earnings which is consistent with the original Barrie plant closure provision.
        During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Corporation recorded a pre-tax charge of $63.5 relating to two plant closures of the Bavaria business as well as the termination costs relating to the former Bavaria distribution network. The charge represents primarily the write-down of substantially all of the related fixed assets to a nominal amount and employee severance costs as well as the distribution
agreement termination costs. The balance of the provision at March 31, 2004 is nil and all closure activities and costs have been completed and paid.
6. Net Interest Expense
        Interest paid in fiscal 2004 was $78.2 (2003$88.4, 2002$75.8).
7. Income Taxes
        The following table reconciles income taxes calculated at the combined Canadian federal and provincial corporate rates with the income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements:
        Income taxes paid in fiscal 2004 were $120.9 (2003$44.6, 2002$19.7).
        Future income tax assets and liabilities are recognized on temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities as follows:
        There are approximately R$444 (2003R$325) of tax loss carry-forwards arising from the operations in Brazil which can be carried forward indefinitely, subject to certain limitations on use. Of these losses, approximately R$111 relates to the pre-acquisition tax loss carry-forwards from the Kaiser acquisition and any future utilization of these losses will be recorded as a reduction to the goodwill recorded on acquisition. In addition, subsidiaries of the Corporation in the United States have approximately US$226 (2003US$225) of tax loss carry-forwards arising primarily from the discontinued Diversey business. Certain of these losses expire commencing in 2008. The potential benefit of these tax losses, including the post-acquisition Brazil losses, has not been recognized in the accounts of the Corporation.
8. Discontinued Operations
        Cash used for discontinued operations consisted of $8.2 (2003$6.2, 2002provided from discontinued operations$12.6) for operating activities. Fiscal 2002 also included $188.6 from cash provided from investing activities relating to the sale of the Sports and Entertainment business.
        The balance sheet includes assets and liabilities relating to discontinued operations as follows: current assets of $2.0 (2003$0.5), long-term assets of $17.5 (2003$20.8), current liabilities of $14.3 (2003$16.2), and long-term liabilities of $76.0 (2003$84.1).
        On July 25, 2001, the Corporation completed the sale of its Sports and Entertainment business consisting of the Montral Canadiens and the Bell Centre (formerly known as the Molson Centre). The Corporation received $190.0 in cash, less closing adjustments, with the balance of payment in the form of preferred shares of an entity owning both the team and the entertainment business. The preferred shares are redeemable on December 31, 2008 for $86.5, subject to certain terms and conditions. The Corporation also retained a 19.9% interest in the entity that owns the team and the entertainment business. The net gain on disposal includes the net losses from discontinued operations of the Sports and Entertainment group between January 31, 2001, the measurement date, and the date of disposal together with tax recoveries of $30.8 and transaction costs.
        As a result of the Corporation's disposals of its Retail, Chemical Specialties, and Sports and Entertainment businesses, the Corporation recorded certain losses and provisions for retained assets as well as other ongoing expenses related to site restoration, contingent liabilities, lease commitments and other possible claims. The estimated losses were based on management's best estimate assumptions with respect to a variety of items. There remains a risk that the assumptions and resulting estimates on which the remaining provisions are based may change with the passage of time and the availability of additional information. Any further change to the provisions will be recognized as a gain or loss from discontinued operations in the period in which such a change occurs.
        The remaining balance of the provision for losses relating to discontinued operations is included in deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet (note 15).
9. Earnings per Share
        The following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share computations for earnings from continuing operations:
        The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is based on the application of the treasury stock method. Under this method, the proceeds from the potential exercise of such stock options are assumed to be used to purchase Class "A" non-voting shares. During the year, 656,075 (2003768,200, 2002427,000) stock options to purchase Class "A" non-voting shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise price exceeded the average market price of the shares during the year.
10. Inventories
11. Investments and Other Assets
(i)
Includes the Corporation's interest in Brewers Retail Inc. ("BRI").
(ii)
Includes the Corporation's preferred shares in the Sports and Entertainment business consisting of the Montreal Canadiens and the entertainment business.
12. Property, Plant and Equipment
13. Intangible Assets, excluding Goodwill
(i)
The balance is being amortized over the contractual term of the distribution agreement of 40 years (note 3). The original cost amounted to $35.0. The accumulated amortization at March 31, 2004 amounted to $1.2 (2003$0.6).
(ii)
The change in the book value of the brand names and of the distribution network access reflecting the fluctuation of the Brazilian real in relation to the Canadian dollar was $6.6 (2003($125.1)) and $0.2 (2003($12.2)) respectively.
14. Long-Term Debt
(i)
Represents borrowings under a $1,125.0 Senior Credit Facility arranged with a syndicate of banks. The facility was used to finance the acquisition of Kaiser on March 18, 2002 and was originally comprised of a $500.0 non-revolving 18-month bridge loan which can be extended by the
Corporation for an additional six months and a $625.0 three-year revolving tranche. The bridge loan was permanently reduced by $200.0 to $300.0 on June 21, 2002, using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of 20% of the Corporation's Brazilian operations (note 3), while the terms of the three-year revolving tranche remained unchanged. The bridge loan expired on September 17, 2003 and was not extended. The interest rate on the term loans is floating based on either prime or banker's acceptance. The average interest rate in fiscal 2004 was 3.9% (20033.7%, 20024.3%). The facility is a direct, unsecured obligation of the Corporation. Also, the Corporation has a $50.0, 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for general corporate purposes. The Corporation can extend the facility, subject to the approval of the lenders. Effective September 16, 2003, the facility was extended for an additional period of 364 days.
(ii)
This debenture is redeemable at the option of the Corporation and was repaid on maturity with drawings from the term loan. The debenture is a direct, unsecured obligation of the Corporation.
(iii)
On September 16, 2003, the Corporation issued $200.0 in two-year floating rate notes as part of a $500.0 medium-term note program. On October 17, 2003, the Corporation issued an additional $50.0 in one-year floating rate notes. The $50.0 notes are redeemable, at the option of the Corporation, and retractable, at the option of the noteholder, on any interest payment date commencing April 19, 2004. Neither party exercised their redemption/retraction provisions on April 19, 2004. The notes bore interest at average rates of 3.0% in fiscal 2004. On September 30, 2003, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap for $100.0 which converted the Corporation's floating rate note due September 16, 2005 to a fixed rate. This swap is cancellable on a quarterly basis at the option of a third party. At March 31, 2004, the interest rate swap had an unrealized loss of $0.6.
(iv)
Represents a $100.0 credit facility with a syndicate of banks, which matured on August 31, 2003 and was fully repaid. Loans under this facility bore interest at rates averaging 3.7% in fiscal 2004 (20034.2%).
(v)
Represents direct, unsecured debentures which are redeemable at the option of Molson Canada. During fiscal 2002, the Corporation entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a nominal value of $100.0 each, which converted the $200.0 debenture due in June 2008 with a fixed rate of 6.0% to a variable rate. In December 2002, a third party bank exercised its right to cancel a $100.0 swap agreement, after which interest expense was recorded at the debentures' fixed rate. The average variable interest rate on the swap in fiscal 2004 was 2.7% (20033.2%, 20023.4%). At March 31, 2004, the variable interest rate swap had a fair value of $11.0 (2003$6.8).
(vi)
Represents the adjustment required to arrive at the fair market value of the Molson Canada debentures as of June 23, 1998, being the date of the acquisition of the additional 50% interest in Molson Canada. This amount is being amortized over the remaining terms of the debentures on a weighted-average basis, which at the acquisition date, was approximately 15 years.
(vii)
Represents various facilities denominated in Brazilian reais bearing interest at rates averaging 20.2% during the year (200318.5%). Of the amounts drawn, $87.1 (2003$40.6) is due within
the next year and is classified as current. Certain loans are secured by liens on the machinery and equipment and by real estate mortgaged.
(viii)
The aggregate maturities of long-term debt during the next five years are estimated to be $347.0, $202.8, $3.1, $2.6 and $202.4. Long-term debt of $259.9 has been included in the current liabilities, however the Corporation intends to refinance this debt with either the term loan or the floating rate notes. Since the terms and conditions of the floating rate notes are only determinable at the time of the placement of the debt, it does not allow for classification as non-current portion of long-term debt.
15. Deferred Liabilities
(i)
Relates to provisions in Brazil primarily for excise (IPI), social security (COFINS), and value-added state (ICMS) taxes.
(ii)
Remaining provisions for loss and deferred liabilities relating to the discontinued operations of the Retail, Chemical Specialties, and Sports and Entertainment businesses (see note 8).
(iii)
The deferred gain arose from the non-cash consideration received on the exchange of brewing assets at the time of the formation of the Molson Canada partnership. Amortization of the balance of the deferred gain will be brought into earnings in equal installments over the next five years or earlier if the non-cash assets are realized.
(iv)
Relates to long-term sales tax payable in certain regions in Brazil and is interest bearing.
(v)
Includes the long-term portion of employee bonuses payable and the DSU liability.
16. Financial Instruments
        Commodity swaps are used to fix the cost of commodities such as aluminum, paper and natural gas. Futures contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations of corn prices. The following table summarizes the notional amount of derivative financial instruments at March 31:
        At March 31, 2004, the aggregate unrealized gain of the cash flow hedges was $0.4 (2003unrealized loss of $6.0).
        The Corporation has entered into interest rate swaps (see note 14(iii) and 14(v) for details).
        The fair value of all debentures, based on rates currently available for long-term debt with similar terms and maturity dates, is estimated to be $792 (2003$752).
        The Corporation's estimate of the fair value of other financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximates their carrying value.
        In March 2003, the Corporation extended for an additional two years its revolving agreement to sell an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable of Molson Canada, with limited recourse, to a third party up to a maximum of $125.0. As at March 31, 2004, net cash proceeds received under this agreement were $87.0 (2003$54.0, 2002$55.0). As the fair value of the assets transferred is equal to book value, there is no gain or loss reported on the sale of the receivables. The Corporation has retained responsibility for servicing the accounts receivable sold. In August 2003, the agreement was amended to increase the maximum amount to $150.0.
17. Capital Stock
AUTHORIZED
        The Corporation is authorized to issue:
(a)
an unlimited number of Class "A" non-voting shares;
(b)
an unlimited number of Class "B" common shares; and
(c)
an unlimited number of preference shares, which shall rank in priority to the Class "A" non-voting and Class "B" common shares and may be issued from time to time in series with the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to each series as and in the manner set out in its Articles.
        The holders of Class "A" non-voting shares are entitled, voting separately as a class on the basis of one vote per share, to elect annually three members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Subject to applicable law, the holders of the Class "A" non-voting shares do not otherwise have a right to vote at meetings of shareholders but are entitled to notice of and to attend all shareholders' meetings except class meetings of the holders of another class of shares. The holders of the Class "B" common shares are entitled to one vote per share at all meetings of shareholders except class meetings of the holders of another class of shares.
        In each fiscal year, the holders of the Class "A" non-voting shares are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends aggregating $0.033 per share before any dividends may be paid on the Class "B" common shares. No further dividends can be paid to the holders of the Class "A" non-voting shares until dividends aggregating $0.033 per share have been declared or paid on the Class "B" common shares, and thereafter the Class "A" non-voting shares and the Class "B" common shares participate equally as to all dividends declared.
        In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Corporation, the holders of the Class "A" non-voting shares and the holders of the Class "B" common shares would be entitled to share equally, share for share, in all distributions of the assets of the Corporation.
        A holder of Class "B" common shares shall be entitled at any time and from time to time to have all or any portion of such Class "B" common shares converted into Class "A" non-voting shares on the basis of one Class "A" non-voting share for each Class "B" common share in respect of which the conversion right is exercised.
        If a general takeover bid offer is made to purchase Class "B" common shares, then the holders of Class "A" non-voting shares may convert all or any of their Class "A" non-voting shares into an equal number of Class "B" common shares for the purpose of tendering such shares into the offer unless (i) a takeover bid offer is made to purchase Class "A" non-voting shares on identical terms as the offer for the Class "B" common shares; or (ii) holders of more than 50% of the then outstanding Class "B" common shares certify within a prescribed period of time that they do not intend to tender any Class "B" common shares in acceptance of the offer.
        On November 7, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a normal course issuer bid allowing Molson to purchase for cancellation 4,500,000 Class "A" non-voting shares and 900,000 Class "B" common shares. Purchases may be made at certain times over a 12-month period through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange when the Corporation believes circumstances and trading price warrant a share purchase as an appropriate use of corporate funds and for the potential benefit of Molson shareholders. The normal course issuer bid became effective December 14, 2001 and expired on December 13, 2002. On March 14, 2003, the Corporation extended the normal course issuer bid, which expired on March 12, 2004 to purchase for cancellation 3,141,000 Class "A" non-voting shares and
674,760 Class "B" common shares. On March 15, 2004, the Corporation again extended the normal course issuer bid to purchase for cancellation 3,145,000 Class "A" non-voting shares and 673,000 Class "B" common shares which will expire on March 14, 2005.
        During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Corporation repurchased 751,000 Class "A" non-voting (20031,281,275) shares and no Class "B" common shares (2003100,000) at prices ranging between $32.15 and $34.99 per share (2003$31.62 and $38.16) as part of the above-mentioned normal course issuer bid. The total number of Class "A" non-voting and Class "B" common shares outstanding at March 31, 2004 was 127,472,932 (2003127,223,581). Of the total amount of $24.6 (2003$50.2) repurchased, $4.2 (2003$7.8) was charged to capital stock based on the weighted-average stated capital with the excess of $20.4 (2003$42.4) being charged to retained earnings.
ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING
        At March 31, the following shares were issued and outstanding:
        During the year the net change in Class "A" non-voting shares was as follows:
(i)
Including the exercise of options under the stock appreciation rights plan until June 30, 2002.
        During the year ended March 31, 2004, 38,342 Class "B" common shares (2003430,416) were converted into Class "A" non-voting shares and no Class "B" common shares (2003100,000) were repurchased as part of the normal course issuer bid.
STOCK OPTIONS
        The Corporation has a stock option plan for eligible employees and non-employee directors of the Corporation, under which Class "A" non-voting shares of the Corporation may be purchased at a price equal to the market price of the Class "A" non-voting shares at the date of the granting of the option. Effective June 30, 2002, the plan was amended to terminate the stock appreciation rights ("SAR")
associated with the plan so that each outstanding award consists solely of stock options. Previously, the employee had the option of either exercising the option to purchase the shares or the SAR. The SAR entitled the employee to receive shares with a value equal to the difference between the exercise and market price. The options vest over a period of two, three, four or five years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant. At March 31, 2004, there were 5,340,069 stock options outstanding (20035,400,093) and 1,621,313 stock options available (20032,469,345) for future grants. During the year, the Corporation granted 1,369,800 stock options (2003953,200) at exercise prices ranging between $30.63 and $36.96 (2003$29.43 and $36.79).
        The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants during the year: dividend yield of 1.6% (20032.0%); expected volatility of 25.5% (200324.3%); risk-free interest rate of 4.4% (20035.0%); and an expected life of 6 years (20036 years). The weighted average fair value of options granted in the year is $9.09 per share (2003$9.50).
        A summary of the status of the Corporation's stock option plan as at March 31, 2004 and 2003 and of changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:
        The following table summarizes information on stock options outstanding at March 31, 2004:
        The following table summarizes information on stock options outstanding at March 31, 2003:
        At March 31, 2004, 1,621,313 Class "A" non-voting shares (20032,469,345) were available for granting further options and 802,741 Class "A" non-voting shares (2003895,036) were available for optional stock dividends and the share purchase plan.
OTHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
        The Corporation's MESOP contributions of $1.7 (2003$1.6) were charged to earnings during the year.
        As of March 31, 2004, 167,451 DSU's (2003151,115) are outstanding. For the year ended March 31, 2004, $0.4 (2003$0.7) was charged to earnings representing the accrual for services provided in the period which were paid with the issuance of DSU's.
18. Commitments and Contingencies
        The following table represents minimum lease payments for operating lease obligations:
        At March 31, 2004, the Corporation had outstanding letters of credit totalling $73.9 (2003$84.5). Kaiser is party to a number of claims from the Brazilian tax authorities. The Corporation records liabilities for known tax contingencies when, in the judgement of the Corporation, based on review from both internal and external counsel, it is probable that a liability has been incurred. It is reasonably
possible that actual amounts payable resulting from assessments by tax authorities could be materially different from the liabilities the Corporation has recorded due to the complex nature of tax legislation (note 15).
        The Corporation has given certain undertakings to the lenders of the purchaser of the Montral Canadiens and the Bell Centre, such that, in the event that the purchaser is unable to meet its obligations, Molson would exercise control over the entity that owns the entertainment business and the Montral Canadiens at predetermined conditions, subject to National Hockey League approval. The obligations of the purchaser to such lenders at March 31, 2004 were $92.0 (2003$92.0).
        The Corporation and another shareholder of BRI could be required to accelerate the terms of certain payment arrangements sufficient to satisfy their proportionate share of any default on the $200.0 (2003$200.0) debentures of BRI.
        The Corporation is a guarantor of a 99-year lease arrangement related to the land on which the Bell Centre has been constructed. Annual lease payments in fiscal 2004 amounted to $3.2 (2003$2.2) and are based on prevailing interest rates and changes in the Consumer Price Index.
        The Corporation is also subject to certain legal claims arising in the normal course of business, none of which is expected to materially affect the financial results of the Corporation.
19. Employee Future Benefits
        The Corporation has a number of pension plans, of both a contributory and non-contributory nature, which cover certain employees. The majority of pension plans provide defined benefits. The Corporation also has postemployment benefit obligations for certain retired employees.
        The components of the Corporation's benefit expense include the following:
        The actuarial determinations were based on the following assumptions in each year:
        The health care cost trend rates used in 2004 were 6.5% (20037.0%, 20027.5%) for medical, which is reduced 0.5% (2003 and 20020.5%) per year until 2007, and 5.0% (2003 and 20025.0%) thereafter.
        The following information pertains to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans and other benefit plans:
(i)
During fiscal 2004, the Corporation negotiated collective bargaining agreements at the Toronto, Montral and Edmonton breweries which resulted in enhanced pension benefits and represents the Corporation's future obligation.
        As at March 31, 2004, eight (2003eight) of the Corporation's pension plans, included in the above table, had an unfunded obligation of $280.7 (2003$215.0) with an accrued benefit obligation of $949.7 (2003$824.1) and plan assets with a fair value of $669.0 (2003$609.1).
        As at March 31, 2004, approximately 71% (200366%) of all pension plan assets were invested in equities and 27% (200334%) in fixed income securities and 2% (2003nil) in cash.
20. Related Party Transactions
        In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into transactions with related parties. All related party transactions are recorded at their exchange amounts. In Ontario and the western provinces, Molson Canada distributes its products and incurs distribution costs through sales to its equity-accounted provincial distribution companies. Included in cost of sales, selling and administrative costs in the consolidated statements of earnings are distribution and other costs of $158.9 (2003$166.5, 2002$160.1) charged by the equity-accounted provincial distribution companies.
        Included in accounts receivable as at March 31, 2004 were amounts of $9.5 receivable (2003$8.2 payable) from the equity-accounted provincial distribution companies.
21. Unrealized Translation Adjustments
        Unrealized translation adjustments, which arise on the translation to Canadian dollars of assets and liabilities of foreign, self-sustaining operations at period-end exchange rates, resulted in a cumulative loss of $340.3 (2003$363.2) at March 31, 2004. The change in the current year reflects the relative strengthening during fiscal 2004 of the Brazilian real against the Canadian dollar.
22. Segment Disclosures
        The Corporation's business is producing and marketing beer and other malt-based beverages. Its business units are located in three main geographic regions: Canada, Brazil and the United States.
        These segments are managed separately since they all require specific market strategies. The Corporation assesses the performance of each segment based on operating income or earnings before interest and income taxes ("EBIT"). Accounting policies relating to each segment are identical to those used for purposes of the consolidated financial statements. Management of net interest expense and
income tax expense are centralized and, consequently, these expenses are not allocated among operating groups. Inter-segment revenues reflect transactions made on an arms-length basis.
(i)
Includes a $7.0 gain on sale of a property in Canada and a provision for rationalization of $43.3 in Brazil.
(ii)
Restated by $3.7 to reflect previously disclosed stock option expense.
(iii)
Includes the gain on sale of 20% of Molson's operations in Brazil of $64.2 and a provision for rationalization of $63.5
(iv)
Includes a provision for rationalization of $50.0.
(v)
The change in the book value of goodwill reflecting the fluctuation of the Brazilian real in relation to the Canadian dollar was $19.2 (2003($210.9)).
23. Comparative Figures
        Certain comparative figures have been restated to conform to the current year's basis of presentation.
24. U.S. GAAP Reconciliation
        The Corporation's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP. The tables that follow are a reconciliation of the significant differences relating to the
statement of earnings and total shareholders' equity reported between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP for the last two years as permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
(i)
      Employee future benefits
        The Corporation adopted the CICA Handbook Section 3461, "Employee Future Benefits" effective April 1, 2000 on a retroactive basis without restatement of prior year's financial statements. For the purposes of U.S. GAAP, the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" require essentially the same accounting treatment as Section 3461, except for the implementation dates of the standards, with the U.S. standards effective 1987. Based on these different transition dates, differences arise related to the amortization of prior service costs and net actuarial gains and losses.
        In addition, under U.S. GAAP, if the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the market value of the plan assets, a minimum pension liability for the excess is recognized to the extent that the liability recorded in the balance sheet is less than the minimum liability. Any portion of this additional liability that relates to unrecognized prior service cost is recognized as an intangible asset while the remainder is charged to other comprehensive income. Canadian GAAP has no such requirement and does not have the concept of comprehensive income.
(ii)
     Capitalized interest on property, plant and equipment
        Under U.S. GAAP, interest expense allocable to long-term capital projects during construction is considered part of the project cost and as a result is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. There is no such requirement under Canadian GAAP. For the year ended March 31, 2004 the adjustment for capitalized interest is expressed net of depreciation expense of $0.2 (2003$0.1).
(iii)
    Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities (SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No.149)
        U.S. GAAP requires a company to recognize all derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, on the balance sheet at fair value whereas Canadian GAAP does not require derivatives qualifying as hedges to be presented in the balance sheet at fair values. Due to certain documentation and effectiveness testing criteria, none of the Corporation's derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. The change in fair value of derivative contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP is reported in net earnings.
        The fair value of the Corporation's derivative instruments at March 31, 2004 was $4.7 (2003$(12.6)).
(iv)
    Stock options and stock appreciation rights
        Under Canadian GAAP, the Corporation accounts for stock options using the fair value method whereby it records as compensation expense the fair value of all stock options granted. Under U.S. GAAP, the Corporation follows APB No. 25 which does not require recognition of compensation expense when the option price at the date of grant is equal to the market price of the Corporation's shares.
        U.S. GAAP requires that the change in fair value of stock appreciation rights attached to stock options outstanding be expensed over the vesting period. There were no stock appreciation rights attached to options granted subsequent to April 1, 2002. On June 30, 2002, the Corporation cancelled the stock appreciation rights attached to the stock options resulting in a new measurement date under U.S. GAAP, with the total remaining value of the stock appreciation rights at that date to be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options.
(v)
     Deferred costs
        Under Canadian GAAP, certain expenses can be deferred and amortized if they meet certain criteria. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs are expensed as incurred.
(vi)
    Joint ventures
        Under Canadian GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, while under U.S. GAAP, joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. Pursuant to an accommodation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accounting for joint ventures need not be reconciled from Canadian to U.S. GAAP if the required information is included in the Corporation's financial statements. The different accounting treatment affects only the display and classification of financial statement items and not net income or shareholders' equity. See note 4Joint Ventures for summarized financial information about joint ventures.
(vii)
   Minority interest
        The minority interest adjustment represents the applicable impact of the U.S. GAAP adjustments on minority interest.
(viii)
   Consolidated statements of cash flows
        U.S. GAAP requires inclusion of the financing activities associated with the securitization of accounts receivable as an operating activity.
        U.S GAAP requires cash flows from discontinued operations to be reported in their respective activities as disclosed in note 8.
(ix)
    Deferred Gain
        U.S. GAAP requires the deferred gain amounting to $32.5 (2003$38.7), as described in note 15, to be presented as a reduction to the related property, plant and equipment.
(x)
     Recent changes to accounting standards
        In 2003, the FASB amended Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R requires that a variable interest entity ("VIE") be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE's activities and/or is entitled to
receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns. For Molson Inc., the requirements of FIN 46R apply in the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2004.
        The Corporation adopted FIN46R effective April 1, 2004 and was required to consolidate Brewers Retail Inc., Coors Canada Partnership and Molson USA. This resulted in an increase in the following balance sheet items at June 30, 2004: cash $57, accounts receivable $46, property, plant and equipment $222, accounts payable $50, long-term debt $200 and deferred liabilities $42. The Corporation estimates no material increase or decrease to these amounts if we applied FIN 46R at March 31, 2004.
        A similar standard with a consistent financial statement impact will be required to be implemented in Canada with an effective date of November 1, 2004.
        As indicated in note 1, the Corporation will be adopting the Accounting Guideline 13 effective April 1, 2004.
25. Subsequent Event
        On July 21, 2004, the Corporation entered into an agreement with Adolph Coors Company ("Coors") to combine the two companies. The transaction is structured as a merger of equals by a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporation Act whereby all of Molson's shares will be exchanged for shares of Coors common stock and/or exchangeable shares of Molson Coors Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Coors will change its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company and its shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

Exhibit 99.4
ITEM 1. Business
        On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. ("Molson"). In connection with the merger (the "Merger"), Adolph Coors Company became the parent of the merged company and changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of us includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC) (formerly Adolph Coors Company), principally a holding company, its operating subsidiaries, Coors Brewing Company (CBC), operating in the United States (U.S.); Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.); and our other corporate entities.
        Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report excludes Molson operating in Canada and Brazil, and is presented in U.S. Dollars (USD).
(a)   General Development of Business
Global Expansion
        Since our founding in 1873, we have been committed to producing the highest-quality beers. Our portfolio of brands is designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes, styles and price preferences. Until our acquisition of CBL in February 2002, we operated and sold our beverages predominately in North America and in select international markets. The CBL acquisition expanded our international presence to include significant operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of the Merger, and the addition of significant operations in Canada and Brazil, we are now the fifth-largest brewer by volume in the world.
Molson Inc.
        Molson is Canada's largest brewer and one of the world's leading brewers of quality beer, ranking fourteenth in the world as measured by volume, before the Merger. Molson sells its beer in Canada, Brazil and the United States. Molson has five breweries in Canada and eight breweries in Brazil and distributes over 75 owned or licensed brands of beer.
        The Merger was effected by the exchange of Coors stock for Molson stock in a transaction that is valued at approximately $3.6 billion. Coors is considered the accounting acquirer, although the transaction is viewed as a merger of equals by the two companies. The transaction is discussed in Notes 2 and 20 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Molson's business and historical results are discussed at length in the definitive proxy, dated December 9, 2004 and supplemented on January 19, 2005, that are on file with the SEC and available on its EDGAR database.
Joint Ventures and Other Arrangements
        To focus on our core competencies in manufacturing, marketing and selling malt beverage products, we have entered into joint venture type arrangements with third parties over the past decade to leverage their strengths in areas like can and bottle manufacturing, transportation, packaging, engineering, energy production and information technology. Prior to the Merger, we participated in joint ventures with Molson to market Coors products in Canada (Coors Canada), and Molson products in the United States (Molson USA).
Our Products
        We own or license all of our trademarks for all of our brands. Brands sold primarily in the United States, its territories and Canada include: Coors Light, Coors, Coors Non-Alcoholic, Extra Gold, Zima XXX, Aspen Edge, George Killian's Irish Red Lager, Keystone, Keystone Light, Keystone Ice, Blue Moon Belgian White Ale and Mexicali. We also sell the Molson family of brands in the United States through a joint venture. Brands sold primarily through CBL include:
Carling, Coors Fine Light Beer, Worthingtons, Caffrey's, Reef, Screamers and Stones. We also sell Grolsch in the United Kingdom through a joint venture. With the Merger, we will add the Molson family of brands and key brands in Canada, including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Molson Export, Rickard's Red Ale, and others in Brazil, including A Marca Bavaria, Kaiser and Bavaria to our portfolio.
        In the United Kingdom, in addition to supplying our own brands, we sell other beverage companies' products to our on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. These factored brand sales are included in our financial results, increasing our net sales and cost of goods sold, but the related volume is not included in our reported sales volumes.
(b)   Financial Information About Segments
        Our reporting segments have been realigned as a result of the Merger and are categorized into four operating segments: United States, Europe, Canada and Brazil. These segments are managed by separate operating teams, and each segment consists of manufacturing, marketing and sale of beer and other beverage products.
        See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data (Exhibit 99.7 of this Form 8-K), for financial information relating to our segments and operations, including geographic information.
(c)   Narrative Description of Business
        
Some of the following statements may describe our expectations of future products and business plans, financial results, performance and events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please see Item 7, Management's Discussion and AnalysisCautionary Statement Pursuant to Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, for factors that may negatively impact our performance. The following statements are expressly made, subject to those and other risk factors.
        We sold approximately 67.5% of our 2004 reported volume in the United States segment and 32.5% in the Europe segment. In 2004, Coors Light accounted for about 51% of reported volume and Carling for approximately 22%.
        Our sales volume totaled 32.7 million barrels in 2004 and 2003 and 31.8 million barrels in 2002. The barrel sales figures for each year do not include barrel sales of our products sold in Canada or the United States through our joint ventures with Molson. An additional 1.6 million, 1.5 million and 1.4 million barrels of beer were sold by Molson Coors Canada in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our Molson USA venture sold 0.8, 0.9 and 0.9 million barrels in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These volumes will be included in barrel sales for reporting periods following the Merger on February 9, 2005. Our sales volumes also do not include the CBL factored brands business. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of volume changes.
        No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated or segmented sales in 2004, 2003 or 2002.
        The United States (U.S.) business produces, markets, and sells the Coors portfolio of brands in the U.S. and its territories, including the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Corporation (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Corporation (RMBC) joint ventures consolidated in 2004 under FIN 46R, and the sale of Molson products in the United States. The U.S. segment also includes a small amount of Coors brand volume that is sold outside of the United States and its territories, including primarily Mexico, and the Caribbean.
Sales and Distribution
United States
        In the U.S., beer is generally distributed through a three-tier system consisting of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. A national network of 529 independent distributors purchases our products and distributes them to retail accounts. We also own three distributorships that handled less than 2% of our total domestic volume in 2004.
Puerto Rico and the Caribbean
        In Puerto Rico, we market and sell Coors Light through an independent distributor. A team of our employees manages the marketing and promotional efforts in this market, where Coors Light is the number-one brand. We also sell our products in a number of other Caribbean markets.
Mexico
        During the second quarter of 2004, Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of FEMSA Cerveza, became the sole and exclusive importer, marketer, seller and distributor of Coors Light in Mexico.
Manufacturing, Production and Packaging in the United States
Brewing Raw Materials
        We use the highest-quality water, barley and hops to brew our products. We have acquired water rights to provide for long-term strategic growth and to sustain brewing operations in case of a prolonged drought. We buy barley under long-term contracts from a network of independent farmers located in five regions in the western United States.
Brewing and Packaging Facilities
        We have three domestic production facilities and one small brewery located in Mexico. We own and operate the world's largest single-site brewery located in Golden, Colorado. In addition, we have a packaging and brewing facility in Memphis, Tennessee, and a packaging facility located in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. We brew Coors Light, Coors, Extra Gold, Killian's and the Keystone brands in Golden, and package about 60% of the beer brewed in Golden. The remainder is shipped in bulk from the Golden brewery to either our Memphis or Shenandoah facility for packaging. We recently announced plans to add brewing capability to our Virginia facility and to close our Memphis facility by the end of 2006. We also plan to sell our small brewery located in Mexico.
Packaging Materials
Aluminum Cans
        Approximately 60% of our domestic products were packaged in aluminum cans in 2004. A substantial portion of those cans were purchased from RMMC, our joint venture with Ball Corporation (Ball). In addition to our supply agreement with RMMC, we also have commercial supply agreements with Ball and other third-party can manufacturers to purchase cans and ends in excess of what is supplied through RMMC.
Glass Bottles
        We used glass bottles for approximately 29% of our products in 2004. RMBC, our joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens), produces glass bottles at our glass manufacturing
facility. On July 29, 2003, we extended our joint venture with Owens for 12 years, as well as a supply agreement with Owens for the glass bottles we require in excess of joint venture production.
Other Packaging
        Most of the remaining 11% of volume we sold in 2004 was packaged in quarter and half-barrel stainless steel kegs.
        We purchase most of our paperboard and label packaging from a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. These products include paperboard, multi-can pack wrappers, bottle labels and other secondary packaging supplies.
Seasonality of the Business
        Our U.S. sales volumes are normally lowest in the first and fourth quarters and highest in the second and third quarters.
Competitive Conditions
Known Trends and Competitive Conditions
        Industry and competitive information in this section and elsewhere in this report was compiled from various industry sources, including beverage analyst reports (
Beer Marketer's Insights, Impact Databank and The Beer Institute)
. While management believes that these sources are reliable, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of these numbers and estimates.
2004 United States Beer Industry Overview
        The beer industry in the U.S. is extremely competitive, with three major brewers controlling about 79% of the market. Growing or even maintaining market share has required increasing investments in marketing and sales efforts. U.S. beer industry shipments had an annual growth rate during the past 10 years of less than 1%. The industry's pricing environment continued to be positive in 2004, with price increases on specific brands and packages in select markets.
        The beer market in Puerto Rico had extraordinary growth in the "70s and "80s. Since then, the market has experienced periodic growth and decline cycles. This market has traditionally been split between local brewers, U.S. imports, and other imports. Coors Light is the market leader in Puerto Rico with approximately half the market.
Our Competitive Position
        Our malt beverages compete with numerous above-premium, premium, low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, popular-priced, non-alcoholic and imported brands. These competing brands are produced by national, regional, local and international brewers. We compete most directly with Anheuser-Busch and SABMiller, the dominant beer companies in the U.S. industry. According to
Beer Marketer's Insights
estimates, we are the nation's third-largest brewer, selling approximately 10.3% of the total 2004 U.S. brewing industry shipments (including exports and U.S. shipments of imports). This compares to Anheuser-Busch's 50.2% share and SAB's 18.3% share.
        The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement for the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (consolidated under FIN46R in 2004) and factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but sold and delivered to retail by us), and our joint
venture arrangement with Exel Logistics for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam).
        CBL has headquarters in Burton-on-Trent, England, and is the United Kingdom's second-largest beer company with unit volume sales of approximately 10.5 million U.S. barrels in 2004. CBL has an approximate 20.9% share of the U.K. beer market, Western Europe's second-largest market. Sales are primarily in England and Wales, with the Carling brand (a mainstream lager) representing approximately three quarters of CBL's total beer volume.
Sales and Distribution
United Kingdom
        Over the past three decades, volumes have shifted from the on-trade channel, where products are consumed "on-premise," to the off-trade channel, also referred to as the "take-home" market. Unlike the United States, where manufacturers are generally not permitted to distribute beer directly to retail, the large majority of our beer in the United Kingdom is sold directly to retailers.
        Distribution activities for CBL are conducted by Tradeteam, which operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet. Tradeteam also manages the transportation of certain raw materials, such as malt, to the CBL breweries.
Asia
        We have small developing markets in Japan, China and Taiwan, which are managed by the Europe segment's management team. The Japanese business is currently focused on the Zima and Coors brands and we sell Coors Light in Taiwan. We sell Coors Light and Coors in China.
On-trade
        The on-trade channel accounted for approximately 63% of our U.K. sales volumes in 2004. The installation and maintenance of draught beer dispense equipment in the on-trade channel is generally the responsibility of the brewer in the United Kingdom. CBL owns equipment used to dispense beer from kegs to consumers. This includes beer lines, line cooling, taps and countermounts.
        Similar to other U.K. brewers, CBL has traditionally used loans to secure supply relationships with customers in the on-trade market. Loans have been granted at below-market rates of interest, with the outlet purchasing beer at lower-than-average discount levels to compensate. We reclassify a portion of sales revenue to interest income to reflect the economic substance of these loans.
Off-trade
        The off-trade channel accounted for approximately 37% of our U.K. sales volume in 2004, up 1.3 percentage points from 2003. The off-trade market includes sales to supermarket chains, convenience stores, liquor store chains, distributors and wholesalers.
Manufacturing, Production and Packaging
Brewing Raw Materials
        We use the highest-quality water, barley and hops to brew our products. For agricultural crops such as barley and hops, we place forward contracts to ensure we have availability of the volume and varieties we require. Because we are a global brewer, we have access to many suppliers and sources of raw materials. Due to our global status, we believe we have sufficient access to raw materials to meet our quality and production requirements.
Brewing and Packaging Facilities
        We operate three breweries in the United Kingdom. The Burton-on-Trent brewery, located in the Midlands, is the largest brewery in the United Kingdom. Other smaller breweries are located in Tadcaster and Alton.
Packaging Materials
Kegs
        We used kegs and casks for approximately 57% of our U.K. product in 2004. The high volume packaged in kegs and casks contrasts with the United States business, and reflects a higher percentage of product sold on-premise.
Cans
        Approximately 34% of our products were packaged in cans in 2004. Virtually all of our cans were purchased through supply contracts with Ball.
Other Packaging
        The remaining 9% of our product is primarily packaged in glass bottles purchased through supply contracts with third-party suppliers.
Seasonality of Business
        In Great Britain, the beer industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation primarily influenced by holiday periods, weather and by certain major televised sporting events. There is a peak during the summer and during the Christmas and New Year period. The holiday peak is most pronounced in the off-trade channel. Consequently, our largest quarters are the third and fourth quarters, and the smallest are the first and second.
Competitive Conditions
2004 U.K. Beer Industry Overview
        Beer consumption in the United Kingdom has been in long-term decline since 1980, falling by an average of 0.6% per annum. However, volume has been more stable since 2001. The longer-term decline has been mainly attributable to the on-trade channel, where volumes are now approximately 40% lower than in 1980. Over the same period, off-trade volume has increased by approximately 200%.
        This trend is expected to continue and has been influenced by a number of factors, including the increasing price difference between beer in the on-and off-trade channels and changes in consumers' lifestyles. These trends continued in 2004 with off-trade market growth of 3.5% and a decline in the on-trade market of 2.5%.
        There has also been a steady trend toward lager at the expense of ales, driven predominantly by the leading mainstream and premium lager brands. In 1980, lagers accounted for 31% of beer sales, and in 2004 lagers accounted for over 71%, up from 70% in 2003. While lager volume has been growing, ales, including stouts, have declined during this period, and this trend has accelerated in the last few years. The leading beer brands are generally growing at a faster rate than the market. The top 10 brands now represent approximately 64% of the total market, compared to only 32% in 1994.
Our Competitive Position
        Our beers and flavored alcohol beverages compete not only with similar products from competitors, but also with other alcohol beverages, including wines and spirits. With the exception of stout, where we do not have our own brand, our brand portfolio gives us strong representation in all major beer categories. Our strength in the growing lager sector with Carling, Grolsch and Coors Fine Light Beer positions us well to take advantage of the continuing trend to lagers.
        Our principal competitors are Scottish Courage Ltd., Interbrew U.K. Ltd. and Carlsberg U.K. Ltd. We are the United Kingdom's second-largest brewer, with an approximate 21% market share (excluding factored brands sales), based on AC Nielsen information. This compares to Scottish Courage Ltd.'s share of 25%, Interbrew U.K. Ltd.'s 19% share and Carlsberg U.K. Ltd.'s 14% share. Our core brandsCarling, Grolsch and Coors Fine Light Beerall increased their product sector share in 2004.
        Prior to the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of our 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada partnership through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. The partnership contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and sale of our products. Coors Canada managed all marketing activities for our products in Canada. In connection with the Merger, Coors Canada was dissolved into the Canadian business. Coors Light currently has a 9% market share, and is the largest-selling light beer and the third-best selling beer brand overall in Canada.
        Following the Merger, our Canada segment consists primarily of Molson's beer business including the production and sale of the Molson brands, principally in Canada, our joint venture arrangements related to the distribution of beer in Ontario and the Western provinces, Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under FIN46R), and Brewers Distribution Limited (BDL); and the Coors Light business in Canada.
        Over the past several years, the Canadian beer industry volume has been effectively flat with growth of less than 1% again in 2004. The industry's pricing environment continued to be positive in 2004, but lower priced discount beers gained both volume and share in 2004.
        Following the Merger, the Brazil segment consists of our production and sale of the Kaiser and Bavaria brands in Brazil.
Global Intellectual Property
        We own trademarks on the majority of the brands we produce and have licenses for the remainder. We also hold several patents on innovative processes related to product formula, can making, can decorating and certain other technical operations. These patents have expiration dates ranging through 2021. These expirations are not expected to have a significant impact on our business.
Regulation
United States
        Our business in the United States and its territories is highly regulated by federal, state and local governments. These regulations govern many parts of our operations, including brewing, marketing and advertising, transportation, distributor relationships, sales and environmental issues. To operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from various governmental agencies, including the U.S. Treasury Department; Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau; the U.S. Department of Agriculture; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; state alcohol regulatory agencies as well as state and federal environmental agencies.
        Governmental entities also levy taxes and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. U.S. federal excise taxes on malt beverages are currently $18.00 per barrel. State excise taxes also are levied at rates that ranged in 2004 from a high of $28.52 per barrel in Hawaii to a low of $0.62 per barrel in Wyoming.
Europe
        In the United Kingdom, regulations apply to many parts of our operations and products, including brewing, food safety, labeling and packaging, marketing and advertising, environmental, health and safety, employment, and data protection regulations. To operate our breweries and carry on business in the United Kingdom, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits and licenses from local Licensing Justices and governmental bodies, including HM Customs & Excise; the Office of Fair Trading; the Data Protection Commissioner and the Environment Agency.
        The U.K. government levies excise taxes on all alcohol beverages at varying rates depending on the type of product and its alcohol content by volume. In 2004, we incurred approximately $1.11 billion in excise taxes on gross revenues of approximately $2.9 billion, or approximately $106 per barrel.
Canada
        In Canada, provincial governments regulate the production, marketing, distribution, sale and pricing of beer and impose commodity taxes and license fees in relation to the production and sale of beer. In addition, the federal government regulates the advertising, labeling, quality control, and international trade of beer, and also imposes commodity taxes, consumption taxes, excise taxes and in certain instances, custom duties on imported beer. As well, certain bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into by the federal government, provincial governments and certain foreign governments, especially with the government of the United States, affect the Canadian beer industry. While the beer industry in many countries, including the United States, is subject to government regulation, Canadian brewers have historically been subject to comparatively more regulation.
Brazil
        Brazil does not heavily regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages. There are no significant regulations, other than compliance with standards imposed by food and health regulatory agencies. In addition, there are no licensing requirements for points of sale to offer beer. The federal government imposes excise taxes and custom duties on imported beer and state governments regulate taxes on the distribution of goods and services.
Environmental Matters
United States
        We are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Lowry Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver (Denver), and is managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste Management). In 1990, we recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, a portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with Denver and Waste Management regarding the then outstanding litigation. Our settlement was based on an assumed cost of $120 million (in 1992 adjusted dollars). It requires us to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount.
        Considering uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies, and what costs are included in the determination of when the
$120 million threshold is reached, the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. We cannot predict the amount of any such change, but additional accruals could be required in the future.
        We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware.
        From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. While we cannot predict our eventual aggregate cost for the environmental and related matters in which we may be or are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable.
Europe
        We are subject to the requirements of government and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations did not materially affect our 2004 capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that they will do so in 2005.
Canada
        Our Canadian brewing operations are subject to provincial environmental regulations and local permit requirements. Each of our Canadian breweries other than the St. John's brewery has water treatment facilities. We have comprehensive environmental programs in Canada including organization, monitoring and verification, regulatory compliance, reporting, education and training, and corrective action.
        Molson Coors remains responsible for sites relating to discontinued operations of its chemical specialties business sold in 1996, which require environmental remediation programs and these programs are either under way or are planned. Most of these sites relate to properties associated with previously owned business of chemicals and we have established provisions for the costs of these remediation programs.
Brazil
        Our Brazilian brewing operations are subject to federal, state and municipal environmental regulations regarding, among other things, air emissions, water discharges and waste handling and disposal. Each of our Brazilian breweries has water treatment facilities. We have comprehensive environmental programs in Brazil including organization, monitoring and verification, regulatory compliance, reporting, education and training, and corrective action.
Employees and Employee Relations
United States
        We have approximately 5,400 employees in our United States business. Memphis hourly employees, who constitute about 5% of our United States work force, are represented by the Teamsters union; and a small number of other employees are represented by other unions. The Memphis union contract expires in 2005. We are currently negotiating the terms of the new contract, which will include provisions impacted by our recently announced plans to close the Memphis facility. We believe that relations with our United States employees are good.
Europe
        We have approximately 3,000 employees in our Europe business. Approximately 27% of this total workforce is represented by trade unions, primarily at our Burton-on-Trent and Tadcaster breweries. Separate negotiated agreements are in place with the Transport and General Workers Union at the Tadcaster Brewery and the Burton-on-Trent Brewery. The agreements do not have expiration dates, and negotiations are conducted annually. We believe that relations with our Europe employees are good.
Canada
        Molson has approximately 3,100 full-time employees in Canada. Workplace change initiatives are continuing and as a result, joint union and management steering committees established in most breweries are focusing on customer service, quality, continuous improvement, employee training and a growing degree of employee involvement in all areas of brewery operations.
Brazil
        Kaiser has approximately 3,200 employees in Brazil. A collective bargaining agreement is signed between Kaiser and the employees' trade union for one-year periods in each of the plants. Collective agreements in place exceed the requirements established by law.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
        The following update to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as of March 11, 2005, and has only been revised to reflect the business segments as we now view our business following the Merger on February 9, 2005. We have not updated Outlook or other sections of this Exhibit 99.6 for any events subsequent to March 11, 2005.
Executive Summary
        Our 2004 results reflect good financial performance for the Coors business, despite challenging competitive dynamics in all of our major markets. Net sales were up 7.6%, net income grew 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 8.8%. These positive results were driven by solid beer pricing and continued progress on cost-reduction initiatives. Our full-year profit growth also benefited from gains on asset sales and favorable foreign exchange rates.
        Pretax income for the United States (U.S.) segment was $202.2 million, up 12.9% from a year ago, driven primarily by solid U.S. beer pricing, sales of non-operating assets, and the lapping of lower sales and higher costs in the fourth quarter last year due to U.S. supply chain challenges. These positive factors more than offset sales volume decreases and higher costs in the United States.
        Pretax income for the Europe segment was $156.3 million, up 16.0% from a year ago. Europe financial results in 2004 benefited from a 12% year-over-year appreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar, following an appreciation in 2003 of 8.4%. This boosted Europe income by $16.4 million in 2004 and $9.8 million in 2003, although part of this benefit was offset by higher interest expense on our pound-denominated debt. Besides favorable exchange rates, higher Europe income was driven by off-trade volume growth, better pricing and, subsequently, higher margins in both the on-trade and the off-trade. We also realized a $7.5 million pretax gain on the sale of our Cape Hill brewery property.
        Pretax income for the Canadian segment was $61.7 million, up 29.4% from a year ago.
        We repaid debt obligations totaling $382.0 million in 2004. While the business continued to generate strong operating cash flow, sales of non-operating assets and controlled capital spending contributed heavily to the de-leveraging effort.
        With the completion of our Merger, we are now the fifth-largest brewer in the world. As a newly combined company, our first order of business is to focus on our core markets, investing for growth in our leading brands. Our near-term goals are:
 - 
to rejuvenate growth for Coors Light in the United States;
 - 
to drive profitable growth for Molson Canadian and Coors Light in Canada;
 - 
to keep the growth momentum and share gains building in the United Kingdom;
 - 
to capture cost synergies and other benefits of the Merger to build shareholder value; and
 - 
to determine the near- and long-term potential for our Kaiser business in Brazil.
Results of Operations
        The United States segment is focused on the production, marketing, and sale of the Coors portfolio of brands in the United States and its territories, including the results of RMMC and RMBC, and the sale of Molson products in the United States that, prior to the Merger, was conducted through a joint venture with Molson, Molson USA. The United States segment also includes a small amount of
Coors brand volume that is sold outside of the United States and its territories, primarily in Mexico and the Caribbean.

Net sales and volume
        United States net sales improved $52.2 million or 2.2% in 2004, although sales volumes were lower year-over-year. Net sales per barrel also improved 3.1%, benefiting from a favorable industry pricing environment. Improved U.S. base pricing and lower price promotion levels contributed $46.7 million to sales and profitability. Our United States sales benefited from the introduction of Aspen Edge in early 2004 and strong growth from our Blue Moon and Zima XXX brands in the fourth quarter 2004 (a $10.7 million product mix impact). Collection of fuel price surcharges from customers added $4.6 million.
        Net sales for the United States segment decreased $2.7 million from 2002 to 2003. On a per barrel basis, net sales increased 1.3% while volume decreased 1.4% year-over-year. Net sales were impacted positively by favorable pricing in the United States ($37.4 million).
        The challenges over the past two years to our sales have included volume impacted negatively by growth of consumer interest in low-carbohydrate diets and flavored alcohol beverages, competition to the beer business from wine and spirits, and a mix shift toward lower revenue-per-barrel brands such as Keystone Light, which has experienced volume growth of 12% since 2002, offset in 2004 by higher sales of Aspen Edge, Zima XXX, and Blue Moon.
Cost of goods sold and gross profit
        U.S. segment cost of goods sold increased $2.4 million or 0.2% in 2004, compared to 2003. On a per barrel basis, the increase was approximately 1.0%. The increase is the net effect of inflation
(primarily higher fuel and packaging costs) ($15.1 million); as well as increased labor-related expenses ($12.1 million) and a mix shift to higher-cost brands and packages, such as Aspen Edge in 2004 ($10.9 million); offset by the lapping of extra expense related to our supply chain challenges in 2003 ($6.5 million); and the implementation of FIN 46R which had the effect of reducing our cost of sales by re-allocating certain joint venture expenses in our income statement out of cost of sales ($13.0 million).
        Overall, gross profit increased from 37.3% in 2003 to 38.6% in 2004, with pricing and other factors positively impacting revenue per barrel being the primary drivers.
        U.S. segment cost of goods sold decreased by $8.3 million or (0.6)% in 2003 versus 2002, but increased on a per barrel basis by 0.8%. The overall net increase in cost of goods per barrel was due to higher pension and other labor-related costs ($11.2 million) and additional costs due to information technology upgrades ($8.6 million); offset by lower volume, packaging rebates and cost savings from reorganizations in 2002. Our higher pension costs were the result of lower returns on pension assets in recent years and lower discount rates. In addition, we incurred approximately $6.5 million of increased costs in the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily related to extra freight, direct labor and finished goods loss associated with our new supply chain processes and systems implementation.
        Overall, gross profit increased from 37.0% to 37.3%, with pricing slightly outweighing the negative impacts to cost of goods per barrel.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses
        Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $40.3 million in 2004, compared to 2003, or 5.8%. This represents an additional $2.10 per barrel increase. The increase is due to higher investments in sales and marketing efforts ($29.6 million), in addition to modestly higher labor-related costs ($5.1 million).
        Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $16.0 million or 2.4% in 2003, compared to 2002. On a per barrel basis, marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 3.8% in 2003 compared to 2002. This increase was driven primarily by higher pension and benefit costs ($5.6 million) and higher spending levels related to information technology ($6.0 million).
Other income, net
        Other income increased by $13.6 million comparing 2004 to 2003. This is largely due to one-time gains from the sales of non-operating real estate in the fourth quarter of 2004 totaling nearly $12.0 million, and the receipt of a lump-sum royalty payment of $4.8 million in 2004 related to a court settlement.
        The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands, principally in the United Kingdom, our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies, but sold and delivered to retail by us), and our joint venture arrangement with Tradeteam for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain. It also includes the sale of Coors
Fine Light Beer in the United Kingdom and Coors Light in the Republic of Ireland, as well as a small amount of Coors brand volume sold in Asia, primarily in Japan and China.

Foreign currency impact on results
        Our Europe segment benefited from a 12.0% and 8.4% year-over-year increase in the value of the British pound sterling (GBP) against the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, respectively. As a result of this exchange rate fluctuation, results from our Europe segment in 2004 are significantly higher than in the prior year; however, the increases are tempered by increased interest costs in the Corporate segment as a result of our hedging activities related to GBP-denominated debt. For example, Corporate unallocated expense was adversely affected by foreign currency increases on GBP denominated hedges
by approximately $7.6 million in 2004. The following table summarizes the approximate effect the changes in the GBP exchange rate had on the Europe results as presented above in 2004 and 2003:
(1)
For 2004, assuming the same rates as 2003; for 2003, assuming the same rates as 2002.
Net sales and volume
        Net sales for the Europe segment increased 14.8% in 2004, while volume increased 1.5% from the previous year. Approximately 12.0% of the net sales increase represents the effect of GBP currency exchange rates. The volume growth was driven by the Carling and Grolsch brands, which grew volume for the year by approximately 7% and 6%, respectively. Volume growth for the year was restricted by the cooler and wetter summer weather in the United Kingdom compared to a record breaking summer in 2003 and the comparison to a period of high off-trade discounting in the first half of 2003.
        Our on-trade business, which represents approximately two-thirds of our Europe volume and an even greater portion of margin, saw volume decline marginally by (0.5%) compared to 2003. This compared to an overall on-trade market decline of 2.5% in the year, yielding a market share gain of approximately 0.7%. Our off-trade volume for 2004 increased approximately 6% over 2003, led by Carling and Grolsch. Our off-trade market share growth for the year was approximately 0.6 percentage points.
        In addition to the volume movements documented above, we had positive pricing in both the on-trade and the off-trade, and an increase in the sales value of factored brands. These gains were partially offset by negative channel and brand mix. Owned brand net sales per barrel increased approximately 2.6% for the year.
        Net sales for the Europe segment increased 15.3% in 2003, while volume increased 13.0% from the previous year. The significant increase in net sales and volume was partly due to our owning the CBL business for the full year in 2003 versus forty-seven weeks in 2002. GBP currency exchange rates accounted for 8.4% of the net sales increase. On a full year comparative basis, our sales volumes increased 6.7%. This growth was driven by the Carling and Grolsch brands, both of which grew volume by more than 10% during the year.
        Our on-trade business grew volume by approximately 5.0% compared to the full year 2002 as a result of strong sales execution, particularly with Carling and Carling Extra Cold, and unusually hot weather in the United Kingdom during the summer in 2003. In a declining on-trade market, this yielded a market share gain of approximately 1.5%.
        Our off-trade volume for 2003 increased approximately 13.0% over the comparable period in 2002, led by Carling and Grolsch.
        Contributing factors to this volume growth were the favorable summer weather and aggressive discounting, primarily in the first half of 2003. Our off-trade market share growth for 2003 was approximately one percentage point.
        Our positive volume in both the on- and off-trade and positive pricing in the on-trade were partially offset by a decline in our on-trade factored brand sales and, in the off-trade, heavy price discounting and mix shift toward lower revenue-per-barrel sales. The decline in sales of factored brands in the on-trade was driven by some of our large on-trade chain customers purchasing products from other suppliers.
Cost of goods sold and gross profit
        Cost of goods sold increased 13.5% in 2004 versus 2003, with approximately 12.0% of the increase being due to the effect of GBP currency exchange rates.
        The increase in local currency cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher labor costs, together with a mix shift to the off-trade where products have higher packaging costs, and an increase in the value of factored brand purchases where the cost is included in our cost of goods sold.
        These increases were offset by the benefit to costs of goods sold of implementing FIN46R, and a reduction in contract packaging costs from 2003, where we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off-trade volume while we were commissioning the new and upgraded packaging lines in our Burton brewery.
        On a per-barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 11.9%; excluding the impact of GBP currency exchange rates cost of goods sold per barrel was broadly flat compared to 2003.
        Gross profit in the Europe segment increased 17.6%; and excluding the impact of GBP foreign exchange, gross profit increased 4.8%. Gross profit per barrel increased 15.9%, and by 3.3% excluding the impact of GBP foreign exchange. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 0.8% during 2004.
        Cost of goods sold increased 19.1% in 2003 versus 2002. On a per-barrel basis, cost of goods sold increased 5.4%. The aggregate increase in cost of goods sold was driven by increased volume and higher GBP foreign exchange rates, coupled with owning the CBL business for the full year versus only a partial period in 2002. Also driving this increase, and the increase in the per barrel cost, was the reclassification of Tradeteam earnings from cost of goods sold to other income beginning in 2003 and the loss of income from contract brewing arrangements that substantially ceased near the end of 2002. Additionally, during the first three quarters of 2003, we incurred higher production costs as we contracted with regional brewers to package some of our off-trade volume while we were commissioning new packaging lines in our Burton brewery.
        We realized some benefit from right-sizing and improving our U.K. production infrastructure towards the latter half of 2003, which partially offset the increases noted above. The increases in cost of goods sold were also reduced by the decrease in factored brand volume where the purchase cost is included in our cost of goods sold, but the related volume is not included in reported volumes.
        Gross profit in the Europe segment increased 7.7% in 2003, compared to 2002; however, excluding the impact of GBP foreign exchange, gross profit was essentially flat despite the inclusion of a full year of sales in 2003. Gross profit per barrel decreased 4.7% and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 2.2% during 2003 as a result of the reclassification of Tradeteam earnings to other income in 2003, and our contract packaging costs incurred as we commissioned the packaging lines in Burton.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses
        Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 16.4% during 2004; and 14.7% on a per barrel basis. GBP foreign exchange accounted for the great majority of this increase.
        Various factors increased marketing, general and administrative expenses during 2004: (a) we had higher labor-related and information technology costs; (b) in 2003, costs were reduced by a one-time gain of $3.5 million before tax on the sale of the rights to our Hooper's Hooch FAB brand in Russia; and (c) implementation of FIN46R transferred costs from cost of goods sold into marketing, general and administrative costs. These increases were partly offset by decreased marketing costs. Spend on marketing core brands increased nearly 20% (including investment relating to the launch of Coors Fine Light Beer), however this was more than offset by a decrease in spending on non-core brands as the business has focused on its key growth brands for the future.
        Europe marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 8.7% during 2003 almost entirely due to exchange rates and the impact of the full year of ownership of CBL. On a per-barrel basis, marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 3.8% year-over-year. Various factors impacted marketing, general and administrative expenses during 2003, which effectively off-set each other: (a) we had higher investments in sales staff and increased depreciation charges from investments in information systems and dispense equipment, the latter supporting the sales growth in the on-trade; (b) we were impacted by the loss of reimbursements from the transitional services arrangements with Interbrew S.A. that were set up following the CBL acquisition in February 2002 and largely concluded by the end of that year. These reimbursements were recorded as a reduction to marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2002; (c) we realized savings in employee bonus costs and directors' costs; and (d) the one-time gain of $3.5 million on the sale of the rights to our Hooper's Hooch FAB brand in Russia during the third quarter.
Other (expense) income, net
        The adverse movement in other (expense) income, net in 2004 was a result of a decline in Tradeteam operating performance, GBP currency exchange rate movements, and increased non-operating leasehold expenses.
        In 2003, other income increased as a result of the inclusion of Tradeteam income (included in cost of goods sold in 2002) and GBP currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by an increase in non-operating leasehold expenses.
Interest income
        Interest income is earned on trade loans to U.K. on-trade customers. Interest income decreased 6.6% in 2004 despite favorable GBP foreign exchange rates, as a result of lower loan balances in 2004. Interest income increased 4.7% in 2003 as a result of favorable GBP foreign exchange rates, the inclusion of an additional five weeks of results in 2003, netted against lower loan balances in 2003.
        Prior to the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of our 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada partnership through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. The partnership contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and sale of our products. Coors Canada managed all marketing activities for our products in Canada. In connection with the Merger, Coors Canada was dissolved into the Canadian business. Coors Light currently has a 9% market share, and is the largest-selling light beer and the 4-best selling beer brand overall in Canada.

        Following the Merger, our Canada segment consists primarily of Molson's beer business including the production and sale of the Molson brands, principally in Canada, our joint venture arrangements
related to the distribution of beer in Ontario and the Western provinces, Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under FIN46R), and Brewers Distribution Limited (BDL); and the Coors Light business in Canada.
N/M = Not meaningful
(1)
Net sales represent royalties to the Company from Coors Canada.
        Income from the Coors Canada partnership was higher in 2004 versus 2003 primarily as a result of improved product pricing for Coors Light ($9 million). A stronger Canadian dollar ($3 million) and higher beer volume ($1 million) also contributed to improved Canada results.
        Income from the Coors Canada partnership was higher in 2003 versus 2002 due to a stronger Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar ($5.3 million), higher Coors Light sales volume ($2.6 million), and improved pricing ($2.6 million).
        Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to the other operating segments. Corporate contains no sales or cost of goods sold, although certain royalty income and intangible administrative costs are absorbed by Corporate. The majority of
these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.

(1)
Relate primarily to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees not eligible for capitalization. Molson merger costs will primarily be capitalized in purchase accounting. Approximately $1.8 million were expensed in marketing, general and administrative expenses during 2004.

Consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), bank fees and gains on sales of investments.
(3)
Loss before income taxes in 2004 includes $1,595 of the minority owner's share of interest expense attributable to debt obligations of the RMMC joint venture.
Marketing, general and administrative expenses
        Marketing, general and administrative expenses were approximately $14.7 million higher in 2004, than 2003, due to increased incentive compensation costs ($7.5 million), other labor-related costs ($2.5 million), and Merger and regulatory-compliance costs ($1.5 million). Marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased significantly from 2002 for similar reasons, except for the cost of the Merger with Molson. Regulatory compliance costs have increased of necessity, due to implementation of procedures to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 over the past two years.
Interest expense, net
        Interest expense decreased 12.5% in 2004, compared to 2003 due to our pay down of debt and from swapping some of our debt from fixed to floating rates. Full-year 2004 debt repayments at $382 million were about 40% above 2003. Our cash flow and debt pay down benefited from asset monetization and capital spending discipline in 2004. In the three years since we bought the U.K. business, we have repaid $862 million of debt principal as of year-end 2004.
        Interest expense increased $13.0 million or 19.6% in 2003. This increase was driven by having our fixed-rate debt structure in place for the full year in 2003 versus only eight months in 2002 and the currency appreciation on our GBP-denominated term debt prior to its payoff in August 2003. The increase is also due to our cross-currency swap structure and our GBP-denominated interest expense. Partially offsetting these factors was the implementation of our lower interest rate commercial paper program in June 2003, the initial proceeds of which we used to pay down approximately $300 million of higher-rate GBP-denominated term debt.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
        Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities, external borrowings and asset monetization. As of December 26, 2004, including cash and short-term borrowings, we had positive working capital of $91.3 million compared to negative working capital of $54.9 million at December 28, 2003. At December 28, 2003, cash and cash equivalents totaled $19.4 million, compared to $123.0 million at December 26, 2004. The improvement in our working capital is due to the consolidation of RMMC, RMBC and Grolsch ($28 million) and cash management. The increase in cash is mainly due to cash acquired when our joint ventures were consolidated in the first quarter of 2004 ($20.8 million), cash received from Interbrew ($25.8 million) related to the settlement of a pension liability dispute and reduced capital spending (approximately $28.9 million).
        We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. However, our liquidity could be impacted significantly by a decrease in demand for our products, which could arise from competitive circumstances, a decline in the acceptability of alcohol beverages, any shift away from light beers and any of the other factors we describe in the section titled "Risk Factors." We also have credit facilities that contain financial and operating covenants, and provide for scheduled repayments, that could impact our liquidity on an ongoing basis.
        We continue to evaluate opportunities to supplement our operating cash flow through potential monetization of assets. During the second quarter of 2004, CBL outsourced the ownership, procurement and tracking of its approximately 1.2 million kegs and casks with TrenStar, Inc. As a result, we received a cash payment of approximately 28 million ($50 million at second quarter rates). In the fourth quarter of 2004, we sold certain land holdings in Golden, Colorado and received cash related to the sale of our Cape Hill facility in the U.K. In total, our proceeds from asset monetization in 2004 were $72.1 million.
Operating Activities
        Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $28.9 million, compared to 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash taxes in 2004 versus 2003 when favorable finalization of tax audits resulted in refunds, offset by the reporting of additional cash flows as a result of consolidating certain joint ventures in 2004. Also, improved sales at the end of 2004, compared to 2003 resulted in higher receivable and inventory balances, which served to lower cash flows from operations in 2004.
        Net cash provided by operating activities increased $283.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease was attributable primarily to cash provided by trade receivables and payables in 2003the result of continued emphasis on working capital management by improving receivable collection in the United Kingdom, the favorable impact of tax audits in 2003 and managing the purchasing cycle throughout the company in 2003.
Investing Activities
        Cash used in investing activities decreased $147.2 million during 2004, compared to 2003. This improvement is attributable to reduced capital spending in 2004, cash received from the sale of kegs in the U.K., and the pension settlement received in 2004 from Interbrew. Also, we presented as an investing activity the inclusion of the opening cash balances of the joint ventures we began consolidating during the first quarter of 2004 as result of implementing FIN 46R (see Note 3 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in Exhibit 99.7).
        During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2003, we used net cash of $214.6 million in investing activities compared to $1.6 billion used in 2002. The decrease in net cash used is due to the $1.6 billion payment, net of cash acquired, made to purchase CBL in 2002. However, excluding our 2002 $1.6 billion payment to acquire CBL, total cash used in investing activities increased approximately $231.2 million compared to the same period in 2002, mainly due to the absence of sales and maturities of investments in 2003 versus 2002. A significant amount of investments was sold in 2002 to help fund the acquisition of CBL.
Financing Activities
        Net cash used in financing activities was $335.6 million in 2004, compared to $357.4 million in 2003. The change is mainly the result of increased repayments of debt in 2004, offset by cash received from increased stock option exercises during the year. We have also included a new item, "Dividends paid to minority interest holders," in the Financing activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This item represents distributions from our joint ventures consolidated as result of FIN 46R to the minority interest holders in those joint ventures. There is no significant net impact to cash flows as a result of the adoption of FIN 46R. However, from a year-over-year comparison standpoint, cash flows from operating activities have been increased and cash flows from financing activities have been decreased as a result of classifying dividends paid to minority interest holder in financing activities.
        Net cash used in financing activities was $357.4 million in 2003, representing a $1.6 billion decrease from cash provided by financing activities in 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to the $2.4 billion proceeds from issuance of debt in 2002, partially offset by larger payments on debt and capital lease obligations in 2002. Debt-related activity in 2003 reflected net payments of long- and short-term debt totaling $297.1 million whereas in 2002, debt-related activity reflected a net increase in long- and short-term debt of $1.3 billion, due primarily to borrowings related to our acquisition of CBL.
        Our total borrowings as of December 26, 2004, were composed of the following:
        The aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings for the next five fiscal years are as follows:
        We incurred significant debt in 2002 to finance the purchase of CBL. Since the acquisition, we have used cash from operating activities and from asset monetization, net of capital expenditures and other cash used in investing activities, to make payments on our debt obligations.
        Some of our debt instruments require us to meet certain covenant restrictions, including financial tests and other limitations. As of December 26, 2004, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.
        A special dividend equal to Cdn. $652 million ($523 million) was paid to the holders of record of Molson stock on February 8, 2005, as a condition for completing the Merger. As a result, the newly combined company has increased its debt obligations to pay the dividend.
        A new bank facility was negotiated in connection with the Merger, which has financed the cash requirements of the special dividend. We intend to refinance these obligations during 2005, with permanent financing.
        Standard & Poors downgraded our credit rating from BBB+ to BBB subsequent to the Merger. Concerns regarding the health of the Brazilian and Canadian businesses influenced this decision, in addition to the debt burden as a result of the special dividend. Our Moody's credit rating is Baa2.
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
Contractual Cash Obligations as of December 26, 2004
(1)
We have had several significant changes to our debt obligations in 2004: (a) Due to the implementation of FIN46R in the first quarter, we consolidated the RMMC accounts, including approximately $45 million of notes payable. The debt proceeds have been used by RMMC to finance capital improvements, and totaled $40.9 million at December 26, 2004. ACC and CBC have guaranteed payment of the debt. (b) At December 28, 2003, we had $86.0 million outstanding in an unsecured senior credit facility consisting of a U.S. dollar-denominated amortizing term loan. We paid the outstanding balance off in full during the first quarter of 2004. (c) In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million in commercial paper. At December 26, 2004, we had no balance outstanding. Subsequent to December 26, 2004, and coincident with the Merger, we, as a combined company, added approximately Cdn. $652 million ($523 million) of debt related to the payment of a special dividend to the Molson shareholders. Merger-related debt is not reflected in this table.
(2)
The "interest payments" line includes interest on our bonds and other borrowings outstanding at December 26, 2004, excluding the positive cash flow impacts of any interest rate or cross currency swaps. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. The "derivative payments" line includes the interest rate swap and cross currency swap payment obligations only, which are paid to counterparties under our interest rate and cross currency swap agreements. Current floating interest rates and currency exchange rates are assumed to be constant throughout the periods presented. We will be receiving a total of $462.4 million in fixed rate payments from our counterparties under the swap arrangements, which offset the payments included in the table. As interest rates increase, payments to our counterparties will also increase. Net interest payments, including swap receipts and payments, over the periods presented are as follows. This table excludes interest payments or derivative activity contemplated as a result of the Merger.
(3)
Represents expected contributions under our defined benefit pension plans in the next twelve months and our benefits payments under retiree medical plans for all periods presented.
(4)
Includes a U.K. sale-leaseback included in a global information services agreement signed with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) late in 2003, effective January 2004, and totaling $6.4 million at December 26, 2004. The new EDS contract includes services to our United States and Europe operations and our corporate offices and, unless extended, will expire in 2010.
(5)
Approximately $1.9 billion of the total other long-term obligations relate to long-term supply contracts to purchase raw material and energy used in production, including our contract with Graphic Packaging Corporation, a related party, dated March 25, 2003. Approximately $1.1 billion relates to commitments associated with Tradeteam in the United Kingdom. The remaining amounts relate to sales and marketing, information technology services, open purchase orders and other commitments, and exclude any purchasing synergies related to the Merger.
Other Commercial Commitments as of December 26, 2004
Advertising and Promotions
        As of December 26, 2004, our aggregate commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events, total approximately $170.0 million over the next five years.
Capital Expenditures
        In 2004, we spent approximately $211.5 million on capital improvement projects worldwide. Of this, approximately half was in support of the Europe business and half was for the U.S. business. We currently plan capital expenditures to be significantly higher as a result of the merger. Base capital spending in the U.S. and U.K. is expected to be approximately $300 million, with the increase in 2005 due mainly to the build-out of the Shenandoah facility to a full brewery. Base capital spending in Canada and Brazil is expected to approximate $80 million, while capital spending in the U.S. and Canada to support synergies is estimated at $50-$60 million in 2005.
Pension Plans
        During 2004 the combination of investment returns and our contributions of approximately $95 million to our combined plans resulted in a slightly improved funded position at year end 2004 versus year end 2003, despite a continued decline in discount rates. At year-end 2004, the accumulated pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the plan assets on a consolidated U.S. dollar basis by approximately $409.1 million, compared to $410.8 million at the end of 2003. We experienced actuarial losses in 2004 due to higher than expected early retirements in the U.S. Plan and we have taken a charge to equity of $42.3 million, pre-tax in 2004 for additional minimum liabilities (See Item 8, Note 14, "Other Comprehensive Income"). At year-end 2004, our consolidated projected benefit obligations were $3.0 billion and the accumulated benefit obligations were $2.7 billion. The amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for accrued pension liability, accumulated other comprehensive loss and intangible asset in 2004 are $409.1 million, $401.7 million ($259.7 million, net of tax), and $34.7 million, respectively. In 2004, consolidated pension expense was $43.7 million, which represented approximately 1.1% of consolidated cost of goods sold and other operating expenses.
        It is our practice to fund amounts for pensions at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws and local tax laws. Pension contributions on a consolidated basis were $95.0 million during 2004. We anticipate making voluntary contributions of approximately $78.2 million in 2005 to pension plans (including supplemental executive plans) in the U.S. and U.K., and required contributions in Canada. However, management may increase these funding levels in evaluating 2005 spending priorities. For further information regarding pension plan assets, refer to Note 15, "Employee Retirement Plans" in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Exhibit 99.7.
        In 2004, our actuarially assumed long-term rates of return on plan asset investments were 9.0% for the U.S. Retirement Plan and 7.8% for the U.K. Plan. In selecting those assumptions, we considered investment returns by asset class and applied the relevant asset allocation percentages. The discount rates used to determine pension expense in 2004 of 6.25% and 5.625% were based on prevailing yields of high-quality corporate fixed income investments and relevant indices in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.
        On a consolidated basis, we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of $616.4 million and $598.0 million at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively. Actuarial losses are primarily comprised of cumulative investment returns that are lower than actuarially assumed investment returns and liability losses due to increased pension liabilities and falling interest rates. Pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial losses after they exceed certain thresholds. As a result of losses in excess of the thresholds, we recorded actuarial loss of $14.9 million in 2004 and $9.1 million in 2003. We anticipate pension expense for the U.S. and U.K. plans will decrease from the $43.7 million in 2004 to approximately $37.7 million in 2005. The expected decrease in consolidated pension cost is due to the impacts of higher actuarial loss amortization and GBP foreign exchange, net of changes in plan features announced subsequent to 2004 (see Note 20, "Subsequent Events" in Exhibit 99.7).
Special Items, net
Cape Hill Brewery Sale
        We sold our Cape Hill brewery property in May 2004 for 26 million (approximately $50 million at current exchange rates), with 6 million payable to us in 2004 and 20 million due in 2005, resulting in a one-time pretax gain of approximately 4 million ($7.5 million, which has been included in Special items on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income). We recorded an insignificant portion of the ultimate gain in the second quarter of 2004 under the installment method. We recorded the remaining gain on sale in the fourth quarter of 2004 after the remaining 2004 payment was received. The note receivable is included in other current receivables.
        In 2002, we recorded charges related to the closing of our Cape Hill brewery, which were included as part of our purchase accounting upon the acquisition of CBL. Closure of the Cape Hill brewery commenced in July 2002 with the shut down of the kegging line. All production ceased in December 2002, at which time the assets, which were included in properties, net, were reclassified as held-for-sale. No impairment was taken on the assets, as their market value exceeded their carrying value. The payment of severance and other termination benefits started in July 2002 and was completed in December 2004. We reduced goodwill for unpaid restructuring liabilities upon full gain recognition in December 2004. The closure of the Cape Hill brewery was possible as a result of the cessation of the production contract for Interbrew U.K. Ltd., which was in existence upon acquisition of CBL. We estimate the annual savings from the Cape Hill closure, net of the loss of income from the Interbrew U.K. Ltd production contract, approximate 11 million (approximately $20 million), reflected primarily in cost of goods sold.
2002 Special Items
        During 2002, we incurred net pretax special charges of $6.3 million. We recorded special charges of $2.7 million related to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.8 million related to cash payments received on a debt due to us from our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea. We also incurred net restructuring charges of $6.4 million primarily related to restructuring initiatives in our U.S. operations and Golden Brewery business in an effort to consolidate and lower our future overhead costs. The restructuring charges consisted primarily of employee severance costs, which were paid during 2003. We estimate annual savings from the U.S./Golden restructuring programs approximate $10 million, reflected primarily in cost of goods sold.

Outlook for 2005
        Our U.S. segment results will continue to be driven by volume and pricing in 2005. The low-carb diet trend began to decline during 2004, which we believe has eased some of the competitive pressure on Coors Light. Still, the beer category faces significant challenges, as evidenced by soft industry sales to retail in the fourth quarter. In this environment, we have strengthened our marketing and sales efforts, especially behind Coors Light. This is reflected in the new ad creative for Coors Light that we
rolled out in the fourth quarter, as well as in our refocused sales efforts, especially on chain and key accounts. We believe that these and other initiatives contributed to the fourth quarter improvement in Coors Light sales-to-retail trends, and we are working to carry that momentum into 2005. The U.S. beer-pricing environment remains generally positive, despite some recent increases in discounting in a few important markets.
        We have announced plans to close our Memphis brewery, as part of the expected synergies related to the Merger with Molson. We expect to begin transitioning Memphis production to other facilities late in 2005. Costs related to the Memphis closure are currently being determined, with estimated annual savings of approximately $32 to $35 million per year. We plan for U.S. marketing, general & administrative spending for 2005 to be up at a low-to-mid-single-digit percentage rate, in line with the trend over the last several years.
        The U.S. business recently announced certain retirement plan changes to be effective in the third quarter of 2005, enacted with the intent to better match employees' retirement needs and to curb the increased costs related to these plans. The U.S. business expects to incur approximately $52 million of combined retirement plan costs (including retiree medical), and to contribute approximately $52 million to the U.S. plans during 2005; however, larger contributions are being considered. Because these costs are allocated between cost of sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses according to headcount, the majority of the cost savings in future years from the plan amendments in 2005 will be realized in cost of sales.
        In Europe, we expect continued volume growth in 2005 with anticipated share gains in both our on-trade and our off-trade businesses. Volumes in the first half of 2005, however, will face particularly challenging comparisons due to market trends and the beneficial impact in 2004 of the Euro 2004 football (soccer) tournament. Our pricing trends are expected to continue to be positive within both the on-trade and the off-trade channels during 2005, but this will be at least partially offset by the adverse impact of the continued market shift to lower margin sales channels. We also anticipate that shifts in our factored brand sales (beverage brands owned by other companies but delivered to retail by us) will continue to have an adverse financial impact during 2005.
        We anticipate that a shift in our mix from on-trade to off-trade will increase our cost of goods sold due to the higher packaging costs on sales to the off-trade. We expect these and other inflationary cost increases to be partly offset by continued efficiencies in the supply chain.
        Marketing, general and administrative spending is likely to be modestly higher in 2005 as a result of front-end investments and higher overhead expenses, largely on the dispense equipment required to support our strong on-trade market position.
        Other income is expected to decrease in 2005 due to the continued pressures on Tradeteam operating performance.
Molson Coors Merger
        The Merger will have a significant impact on our 2005 results, due in part to the following items:
 - 
A number of management action plans to obtain synergies are being considered, and many of these could have a significant impact on financial results and cash flows.
 - 
The beer business in Canada is a mature market with aggressive competition from one large competitor, many importers, and regional and micro brewers. Price discounting in Canada significantly increased in 2004.
 - 
The beer business in Brazil has been very difficult, resulting in operating losses, asset write-offs, and other restructuring actions since Molson acquired the business in 2002. In addition, results will be impacted by the addition of an additional foreign currencythe Brazilian Real.
 - 
Debt increased as a result of the approximately Cdn. $652 million ($523 million) special dividend awarded to Molson shareholders before the Merger.
 - 
Cost synergies of $175 million, $50 million of which will be captured and used to boost profits in 2005.
 - 
Tax and interest benefits of the merger are estimated to exceed $25 million annually.
 - 
Molson assets will be revalued to fair market value, resulting in higher depreciation and amortization for the merged company.
 - 
Our effective tax rate will be more volatile due to the accrual of U.S. income taxes on Canada's earnings and profits, which will be hard to predict based on purchase price adjustments that are anticipated to occur throughout 2005.
 - 
Molson employees in Canada are covered by a number of defined benefit pension plans. We will value the company's net liability with respect to the Canadian pension plans as part of purchase price accounting. Employees in Brazil are not covered by company-sponsored defined pension plans. Our pension obligations will substantially increase, as we include Molson's pension and the pension in the Brewers Retail Inc., joint venture which we expect to consolidate under FIN 46R.
 - 
We will make significant cash outlays for Merger-related expenses.
Debt Structure
        A special dividend equal to Cdn. $652 million ($523 million) was paid to the holders of the Molson stock on February 8, 2005, as a condition for completing the Merger. As a result, the newly combined company has increased its debt obligations to pay the dividend.
        Subsequent to the Merger we established a $1.3 billion bridge facility which was used to finance the special dividend and will be used to refinance Molson's existing debt. We also established a $1.4 billion, five-year credit facility which was used to refinance the special dividend and will also be used for general corporate purposes and as a commercial paper back-stop. Subsequent to establishing both of these facilities, the existing bank financing at both Molson and Coors was terminated.
Molson's Canada Segment
        We will work to reverse negative volume trends for some of Molson's key brands, especially in the Western provinces of Canada. As a result, we expect selling and marketing costs in Canada to increase as volume growth becomes a priority.
Molson's Brazil Segment
        We will evaluate the near- and long-term potential of the Kaiser business in Brazil during the first half of 2005, which could include significant changes to the business.
Other
        In addition to Merger-related changes, our full-year 2005 consolidated results will also be lapping approximately $24.9 million in one-time pretax gains in 2004 (or 45 cents per share after tax), mostly from non-operating land sales. We will continue to pursue opportunities to prudently monetize non-core and non-operating assets in 2005.
Rights on Change of Control
        Coors has agreements with 12 executive officers, and certain other members of management relating to a change of control of Coors. The Merger constituted a change in control of Coors under these agreements as the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust no longer has voting control of Coors, and as the Board of Directors of the merged company no longer has a majority of directors who were directors of Coors prior to the Merger. Certain terms of these agreements were triggered by the Merger. These agreements generally provide for continued compensation and benefits for a period of two years following the change of control.
        In addition, these employees are entitled to severance benefits if triggering events specified in the agreement occur. These events include direct or constructive termination without cause, resignation for good reason or resignation by the employee during a 30-day period beginning one year after the change of control. Upon a triggering event, the officer will be paid a multiple of annual salary and bonus and will receive continued health, pension and life insurance benefits. For terminated executives and officers, stock option exercises are subject to a floor price equal to the price of Coors' stock on the date of the change of control.
        For each of Coors' then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the compensation includes a payment for the rest of the current year plus three times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, plus benefits for the equivalent of three years coverage, plus three years credit for additional service toward pension benefits. For all other executive officers with these agreements, the compensation includes a payment for the rest of the current year plus two times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, plus two years equivalent benefit coverage, plus vesting and credit for two years additional service toward pension benefits.
        The Company is currently in discussions with each employee covered by the change in control agreements. In return for forfeiting their rights under the agreements, some executives are being offered a retention plan. The impact on future financial results of employees leaving the company or staying under the retention plans has not been determined at this time.
Performance Based Options and Restricted Shares
        The Merger transaction with Molson resulted in the vesting of all outstanding stock options and restricted share units held by employees of both Molson and Coors with the exception of performance based options and restricted share units held by the CEO of Molson. There are 288,000 stock options subject to performance based criteria, and 18,000 restricted shares that can increase to 54,000 based on defined performance criteria. The company will account for both the performance-based stock options and restricted stock under variable accounting, which could have an impact on future financial results depending on the likelihood of meeting the performance targets.
        Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. We review our accounting policies on an on-going basis. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual
results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations:
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        In the United States segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the U.S. segment accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the U.S. segment, we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other letters of credit.
        Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and, because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer (total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage) at the point the account is considered uncollectible. We record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off.
        We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected, and we may be required to record additional allowances.
Pension and Postretirement Benefits
        We have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of our employees in the U.S. and the U.K. We also have postretirement welfare plans in the U.S. that provide medical benefits for retirees and eligible dependents and life insurance for certain retirees. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "
Employers' Accounting for Pensions
" (SFAS No. 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions
" (SFAS No. 106). Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses, salary increases, inflation, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on market conditions.
        We performed an analysis of high yield bonds at the end of 2004 and compared the results to appropriate indices and industry trends to support the discount rates used in determining our pension liabilities in the United States and in the United Kingdom for the year ended December 26, 2004. Discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets are selected at the end of a given fiscal year
and impact expense in the subsequent year. A fifty basis point change in certain assumptions made at the beginning of 2004 would have had the following effects on 2004 pension expense:
        Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the retiree health care plan. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
        Both U.S. and U.K. plan assets consist primarily of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. Equity assets are well diversified between domestic and other international investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large-cap, small-cap, and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of February 25, 2005 with actual asset allocations at December 26, 2004:
        In July 2004, we received 14 million (approximately $26 million at then-current exchange rates) from Interbrew, related to mistakes in pension participant data when CBL was purchased in 2002. The corrected data increased our pension liability at the time of the acquisition (approximately 21 million or $38 million at then current exchange rates). Goodwill associated with the purchase price of CBL was adjusted for the change in the pension liability and for the cash collected from Interbrew during the third quarter. The net effect of adjusting goodwill for the pension liability and the cash received was insignificant. The effect on equity was to increase other comprehensive income by $26.8 million, net of tax by reducing the minimum pension liability. The effect of the adjustment to pension expense will be to reduce amortization of actuarial losses by approximately 21 million (approximately $38 million at current exchange rates) over the remaining working lives of participants (estimated 10 years), and increase the interest component of annual service cost by approximately 1 million or $2 million.
Contingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves
        We estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending matter and revise our estimates. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company-owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. We also expense legal costs as incurred. The most significant estimates that could impact our financial statements relate to the Lowry Superfund site (See Exhibit 99.7, Item 8, Note 18).
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Valuation
        We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "
Business Combinations
" (SFAS No. 141) on July 1, 2001, and No. 142, "
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
" (SFAS No. 142) on December 31, 2001. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, and we evaluate our other intangible assets when there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment, most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets and the rate used to discount those cash flows. For our brewing business goodwill and intangibles we used a rate of 8.0% to discount our cash flows during our annual valuation in 2004, which is a rate we believe to be representative of the weighted average cost of capital for similar assets in 2004. Changes in these estimates could have an adverse impact on the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets.
Derivatives
        We use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation. All derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures. We account for our derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 138 and 149.
" (SFAS No. 133), which we early adopted on December 28, 1998. Such accounting is complex, as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard, which continues to evolve, as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values. These estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances; however, the use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
Income Taxes
        We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "
Accounting for Income Taxes
" (SFAS No. 109) Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities. We adjust our income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.
        We have not elected to permanently invest our foreign earnings in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 23. As a result, we have recorded a net deferred tax liability on the un-remitted earnings of our U.K. subsidiary that would be subject to U.S. tax if repatriated. In conjunction with this calculation, we estimate associated earnings and profit adjustments, potential foreign tax credits and cumulative translation adjustments relating to the GBP foreign exchange rates.
        We do not provide deferred taxes on certain outside basis differences in our acquired foreign subsidiary's stock, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL). This outside basis difference is permanent in duration under SFAS 109 because we do not intend to take any action that would result in recognizing the gain inherent in certain book-over-tax basis differences. As a result, differences between book and tax treatment of income statement items in our U.K. business are treated as permanent. This treatment increases the volatility of our effective tax rate.
        We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period a determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Reductions to the valuation allowance related to the acquisition of CBL that relate to deferred taxes arising from that acquisition would reduce goodwill, unless the reduction was caused by a change in law, in which case the adjustment would impact earnings.
        The recently passed "American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" provides, among other things, a deduction with respect to income of certain U.S. manufacturing activities and allows for favorable taxing on repatriation of offshore earnings. Although the provisions of the Act do not impact the fiscal year 2004 financial statements under current accounting rules, the Act will likely impact our financial statements in future periods. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this Act.
Equity Method Accounting
        We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20%-50% owned investments where we exercise significant influence, but for which consolidation is not required under FIN 46R. As described below, we have an equity ownership in, and conduct business with various joint ventures, which directly relate to our beer business. There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments (see further discussion in Exhibit 99.7, Item 8, Note 4).
        Coors Canada was a general partnership that was formed to market CBC products in Canada. We owned a 50.1% interest in this non-consolidated joint venture that we accounted for using the equity method of accounting due to the effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under the operating agreement. All manufacture, distribution and sale of CBC branded beers were contracted to Molson by the partnership. The partnership never took title to the beer. It was paid an amount equal to the sales proceeds Molson receives from third-party customers, less the amounts retained by Molson for its manufacture, distribution and sale of the CBC branded products. We reflect this amount in net sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Coors Canada was dissolved into our Canadian operations effective with the Merger. Coors Light sold in Canada is regarded as part of the Canada segment.
        In 2004 and 2003, we included our entire share of CBL's Tradeteam joint venture results in the other income, net line of our Consolidated Statements of Income, given the immateriality of its results. In 2002, we included our share of Tradeteam results in cost of goods sold. This change in presentation was attributable to Tradeteam no longer being a captive provider of distribution and logistics services to
CBL. In November 2002, Tradeteam entered into an agreement to provide distribution services to Interbrew U.K. Limited, another large brewer in the United Kingdom.
        The other income, net line includes the equity method losses for the Molson USA joint venture. This joint venture was formed to import, market, sell and distribute Molson products in the United States. We have recorded our share of the venture's results in the other income, net line in our Consolidated Statements of Income given the immateriality of its results.
        A qualitative analysis of our results would be impacted if the results of these joint ventures were included in different lines of our Consolidated Statements of Income, as will be the case for Coors Canada and Molson USA when we dissolve or consolidate these businesses into the merged company in 2005.
Consolidations under FIN 46R
        RMMC and RMBC are dedicated predominantly to our packaging and distribution activities and were formed with companies which have core competencies in the aluminum and glass container businesses. The CBL joint venture with Grolsch was formed to provide a long-term relationship with that brand's owner in a key segment of the U.K. beer market. In 2003 and 2002, our share of the pre-tax joint venture profits for each of these investments was offset against cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2004, as a result of implementing FIN 46R, these entities have been consolidated into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we have determined that they are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary.
        We have examined another potential business relationship during 2004 when implementing FIN 46R. This is the relationship we have with Trigen, the supplier of virtually all our energy needs at our Golden facility. Trigen purchased our power plant facilities in 1995 and signed a contract to provide our energy needs in Golden. We do not own any portion of the Trigen entity, but upon review of the supply contract, we believe that the relationship could be viewed as a variable interest, as defined by FIN 46R. However, despite exhaustive efforts to obtain financial information necessary to proceed with the analysis, we have been unable to obtain the information from Trigen, which cites privacy and competitive issues with releasing this financial information. As disclosed in Exhibit 99.7, Item 8, Note 18 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we purchase approximately $34.0 million of energy each year from Trigen.
        We have determined that any risk of a material loss is remote and that our total maximum loss cannot be reasonably estimated. We do not have another readily available option to obtain the steam energy required to run our plant. We could incur operational losses should we be unable to purchase steam from Trigen, and we are unable to estimate any such losses. In addition, we have a non-cancelable obligation to pay Trigen fixed costs through the remainder of the supply contract. The costs are adjusted annually for inflation and are expected to be $17.5 million in 2005. We currently purchase some of our electricity requirements from another supplier at rates that do not significantly differ from the rates we pay Trigen. Our risk of loss relating to the difference in price from having to buy electricity from another third party rather than from Trigen is not significant. In the event that Trigen would fail to perform its contractual obligations, Coors has the right to step in and operate the power plant facilities. This circumstance would involve Coors repurchasing the power plant assets, a cost that could be borne with Coors' current capital resources.
Performance Based Options and Restricted Shares
        The Merger transaction with Molson resulted in the vesting of all outstanding stock options and restricted share units held by employees of both Molson and Coors with the exception of performance based options and restricted share units held by the CEO of Molson. There are 288,000 stock options subject to performance based criteria, and 18,000 restricted shares that can increase to 54,000 based on
defined performance criteria. The company will account for both the performance-based stock options and restricted stock under variable accounting, which could have an impact on future financial results depending on the likelihood of meeting the performance targets.
        The Merger triggered immediate vesting of all stock options, including those held by Molson option holders (excluding certain options held by the former Molson CEO, as discussed in Exhibit 99.7, Item 8, Note 20). The vesting of Coors options will be reflected in the notes to the first quarter financial statements as pro forma expense and the vesting of the Molson options will be reflected in Molson's historical financial statements, pre-Merger. Therefore, compensation expense recognized beginning in the 2005 third quarter will only reflect new option grants after the Merger, and could be impacted by stock options held by the former Molson CEO that are yet unvested and provisions in change in control agreements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (Revised 2004)
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R) was revised in December 2004 and will be effective for us in the third quarter of 2005. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 when it became effective in 1996 but continue to account for stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25). Currently, under an exemption written into the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, SFAS No. 123 requires us to present pro forma share-based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We have chosen the modified prospective method of adoption, therefore, beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we will be required to record these costs in our income statement. While under current guidance we have used the Black Scholes method to calculate pro forma compensation expense, the new guidance will also allow a binomial method. We are evaluating the alternative methods to value stock options.
SFAS No. 128R "Earnings Per Share" (Revised)
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 128R (SFAS No. 128R) is expected to be revised. We adopted SFAS No. 128 when it became effective in 1997 and will adopt its revised provisions when those provisions become effective, currently anticipated during our first quarter of 2005. For our year-to-date diluted calculations, we currently use a quarterly average stock price. Under SFAS No. 128R, we will be required to use a year-to-date average stock price. When stock prices are increasing year-to-date, as was the case for our company stock in 2004, the effect of the new revision to the standard will be to increase dilution of earnings per share. For example, if we had implemented the new revision in 2004, our year-to-date diluted earnings per share would have been $0.03 per share lower. The new standard will require retrospective presentation of diluted earnings per share upon implementation, meaning that prior periods' earnings per share will have to be adjusted to conform to the same method of calculation.
SFAS No. 151 "Inventory Costs"
        SFAS No. 151 is an amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that will be effective for us in fiscal 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage to require that those costs be expensed currently, as opposed to being included in overhead costs. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 151 will have on our financial results when implemented.
SFAS No. 153 "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets"
        SFAS No. 153 is an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29 that will be effective for us in the third quarter of 2005. The standard tightens the general exception for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our financial results when implemented.
Related Party Transactions
Transactions with Management and Others
        We employ members of the Coors family, which collectively owned 100% of the voting common stock of the company during 2004. Hiring and placement decisions are made based upon merit, and compensation packages offered are commensurate with policies in place for all employees of the company.
Certain Business Relationships
        We purchase a large portion of our paperboard packaging requirements from Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party. As of December 26, 2004, various Coors family trusts collectively owned all of our Class A voting common stock, approximately 30% of our Class B common stock, and approximately 30% of GPC's common stock.
        Our purchases under the GPC packaging agreement in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $104.5 million, $106.4 million and $111.0 million, respectively. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $3.4 million and $5.0 million at December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, respectively.
        We are also a limited partner in a real estate development partnership in which a subsidiary of GPC is the general partner. The partnership owns, develops, operates and sells certain real estate previously owned directly by us. We received no distributions from this partnership in 2004 or 2003.
Risk Factors
        The reader should carefully consider the following factors (which include risks specific to our merged business with Molson) and the other information contained within this document. The most important factors that could influence the achievement of our goals, and cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following:
        Because we will continue to face intense competition, operating results may be negatively impacted.
    The brewing industry is highly competitive and requires substantial human and capital resources. Competition in our various markets could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital and other expenditures or lose market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, in some of our markets, our primary competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, production and distribution resources than Molson Coors will have. In all of the markets where Molson Coors will operate, aggressive marketing strategies by our main competitors could adversely affect our financial results.
        Changes in tax, environmental or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
    Our business is regulated by federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in various countries regarding such matters as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, relationships with distributors, environmental matters and other matters. Failure to comply
with these laws and regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals. In addition, changes in tax, environmental or any other laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
        We have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our stockholders' equity.
    As of December 26, 2004, we had $932.2 million in debt primarily related to our acquisition of CBL, with substantially higher debt subsequent to our Merger with Molson. As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt. If our financial and operating performance is insufficient to generate sufficient cash flow for all of our activities, our operations could be negatively impacted.
        We are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, most significantly the British pound and the Canadian dollar.
    We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in different currencies, most significantly from sales of Coors Light in Canada, and in the GBP subsequent to the acquisition in 2002. Subsequent to the Merger with Molson, we will have significantly more foreign currency exposure to the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. Since our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, income and expenses into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar will affect, perhaps negatively, the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
        Our operations face significant commodity price change and foreign exchange rate exposure which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
    Molson Coors will use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce its products, including malt, hops and water. The supply and price of these raw materials can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, plant diseases and theft. To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, in Brazil agricultural and other raw materials are priced based on the U.S. dollar and, since Molson's sales in Brazil are made in local currency, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real may negatively impact our earnings in Brazil. Both companies have active hedging programs to address commodity price and foreign exchange rate changes. However, to the extent we fail to adequately manage the foregoing risks, including if our hedging arrangements do not effectively or completely hedge changes in foreign currency rates or commodity price risks, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.
        We rely on a small number of suppliers to obtain the packaging and raw materials we need to operate our business.
    For our U.S. business, we purchase most of our paperboard and container supplies from a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. This packaging is unique to us and is not produced by any other supplier. Additionally, we are contractually obligated to purchase substantially all our can and bottle needs in the United States from our container joint ventures or from our partners in those ventures, Ball Corporation (RMMC) and Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (RMBC). Consolidation of the glass bottle industry in North America has reduced local supply alternatives and increased risks of glass bottle supply disruptions. CBL has only a single source for its can supply (Ball). The inability of any of these suppliers to meet our production requirements without sufficient time to develop an alternative source could have a material adverse effect on our business. The supply and price of raw materials, used to produce our products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including frosts, droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, various plant diseases and pests. To the extent that any of the foregoing affects the ingredients used to produce our products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
        Our success depends largely on the success of three primary products, one each in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom; the failure or weakening of one or more could materially adversely affect our financial results.
    Although we currently have 14 products in our U.S. portfolio, Coors Light represented more than 51% of our United States sales volume for 2004. In the United Kingdom, Carling lager is the best-selling brand in the United Kingdom and represented approximately 74% of CBL sales volume in 2004. The Molson Canadian brand represents 25% of Molson's sales volume for the nine-months ended December 2004. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from these brands would have a disproportionately large negative impact on our business.
        If the contract we have with our current information technology service provider fails, we could experience significant disruption in our business.
    We rely exclusively on one information technology services provider for our network, help desk, hardware, and software configuration, both at CBC and CBL. If the service provider fails and we are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could be unable to properly administer our information technology systems.
        We are and will continue to be subject to various contingent tax, environmental and other liabilities and cannot predict with certainty that our reserves for those liabilities will be sufficient. If actual costs for these contingent liabilities are higher than expected, we could be required to accrue for additional costs.
    In the course of our respective businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and other contingent liabilities. These include, among others, (i) claims asserted against Molson's subsidiary, Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A., by Brazilian tax authorities, including claims for income taxes, federal excise taxes, value-added tax, revenue taxes (PIS/federal unemployment insurance contribution) and federal social security tax, (ii) claims by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that Coors is a potentially responsible party at the Lowry Superfund Site and (iii) various other legal claims arising in the ordinary course of our businesses. While we have estimated and accrued for costs expected to be incurred in connection with our contingent liabilities, if actual costs are higher than expected, we could be required to accrue for additional costs and make additional cash payments.
Risks specific to the United States Segment
        Litigation directed at the alcohol beverage industry may adversely affect our sales volumes and our business.
    Molson Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. The suits allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to "children and other underage consumers." In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will vigorously defend these lawsuits and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in these lawsuits.
        We are highly dependent on independent distributors in the United States to sell our products, with no assurance that these distributors will effectively sell our products.
    We sell all of our products in the United States to distributors for resale to retail outlets. Some of our distributors are at a competitive disadvantage because they are smaller than the largest distributors in their markets. Our distributors also sell products that compete with our products. These distributors may give our competitors' products higher priority, thereby reducing sales of our products. In addition, the regulatory environment of many states makes it very difficult to change distributors. Consequently, if we are not allowed or are unable to replace unproductive or inefficient distributors, our business, financial position, and results of operation may be adversely affected.
Risks specific to the Europe Segment
        Consolidation of pubs and growth in the size of pub chains in the United Kingdom could result in less ability to achieve pricing.
    The trend toward consolidation of pubs, away from independent pub and club operations, is continuing in the United Kingdom. These larger entities have stronger price
negotiating power, which could impact CBL's ability to obtain favorable pricing in on-trade (due to spillover effect of reduced negotiating leverage) and could reduce our revenues and profit margins. In addition, these larger customers are beginning to purchase directly more of the products that, in the past, we have provided as part of our factored business. This consolidation could impact us negatively.
        Due to a high concentration of unionized workers in the United Kingdom, we could be significantly affected by labor strikes, work stoppages or other employee-related issues.
    Approximately 27% of CBL's total workforce is represented by trade unions. Although we believe relations with our employees are good, more stringent labor laws in the United Kingdom expose us to a greater risk of loss should we experience labor disruptions.
        Our primary production facilities in Europe are each located at a single site, so we could be more vulnerable than our competitors to transportation disruptions, fuel increases and natural disasters.
    Our primary production facility in Europe is located in Burton-on-Trent, England, where we brew and package approximately two-thirds of our products sold in the Europe business. While our Europe business operations remain centralized, our competitors have multiple geographically dispersed breweries and packaging facilities. As a result, we must ship our products greater distances than some of our competitors, making us more vulnerable to fluctuations in costs such as fuel or packaging costs.
        We depend exclusively on one logistics provider in England, Wales and Scotland for distribution of our CBL products.
    We are involved in a joint venture with Exel Logistics called Tradeteam. Tradeteam handles all of the physical distribution for CBL in England, Wales and Scotland, except where a different distribution system is requested by a customer. If Tradeteam were unable to continue distribution of our product and we were unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we could experience significant disruptions in our business that could have a negative impact on our operations.
Risks specific to the Molson Merger
        We may not realize the cost savings and other benefits we currently anticipate due to challenges associated with integrating the operations, technologies, sales and other aspects of the businesses of Molson and Coors.
    Our success will be dependent in large part on the success of our management in integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of Molson and Coors. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of Molson and Coors or otherwise fail to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger transaction, including the estimated cost savings of approximately $50 million, $40 million and $85 million in the first, second and third years, respectively, following the Merger, and, thereafter, approximately $175 million annually, our results of operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of the two companies may result in unanticipated operations problems, expenses and liabilities, and diversion of management's attention.
        Loss of key members of management could negatively affect our ability to successfully integrate or successfully operate our business.
    We have agreements with twelve executive officers and certain other members of management of the former Coors and other members of management relating to a change of control of Coors. The terms of these agreements were triggered by the Merger transaction with Molson on February 9, 2005. We are evaluating the employment status with each of these employees. However, a loss of any of these members of management, or of key members of the former Molson management could have an adverse impact on our ability to successfully combine, integrate or operate the businesses of Molson and Coors.
        If Pentland and the Coors Trust do not agree on a matter submitted to stockholders, generally the matter will not be approved, even if beneficial to the Company or favored by other stockholders.
    Pentland and the Coors Trust, which together control more than two-thirds of the Company's Class A Common and Exchangeable stock, are parties to voting trust agreements through which they have combined their
voting power over the shares of our Class A common stock and the Class A exchangeable shares that they own. However, in the event that these two stockholders do not agree to vote in favor of a matter submitted to a stockholder vote (other than the election of directors), the voting trustees will be required to vote all of the Class A common stock and Class A exchangeable shares deposited in the voting trusts against the matter. There is no other mechanism in the voting trust agreements to resolve a potential deadlock between these stockholders. Therefore, if either Pentland or the Coors Trust is unwilling to vote in favor of a transaction that is subject to a stockholder vote, we may be unable to complete the transaction even if our board, management or other stockholders believe the transaction is beneficial for Molson Coors.
        Molson has recently incurred losses in its Brazilian operations, recorded restructuring and impairment charges, and could suffer further charges as a result of the Brazilian operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our combined results of operations.
    Molson's Brazilian operations incurred losses in the calendar year ended December 31, 2004. These losses were a function of the current period costs associated with plans to significantly grow volumes and regain market share associated with the sales centers put in place during the last nine months in Brazil. In light of the continuing challenges presented by the Brazilian beer market, Molson recorded restructuring and impairment charges in this business prior to the Merger. Molson's Brazilian operations may continue to incur losses and further impairment charges could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our combined results of operations.
        We may be required to exercise control over the entity that owns the entertainment business and the Montral Canadiens pursuant to the undertakings given to its lenders.
    On July 25, 2001, Molson sold the entertainment business operated in the Bell Centre in Montral and the Montral Canadiens hockey team, which may be financially adversely affected as a result of the National Hockey League work stoppage. As part of the sale transaction, Molson agreed to, among other things, give a guarantee to the team's lenders for loans which as of March 31, 2004 were in the amount of Cdn.$92 million.
        In addition, Molson is the guarantor of the 99-year lease arrangements on the Bell Centre related to the land on which the Bell Centre is located. The amount of lease payments varies based on prevailing interest rates and changes in the Consumer Price Index. In Molson's fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, the payments under the lease made by the purchaser totaled Cdn. $3.2 million.
        If the purchaser is unable to meet its obligations, Molson will exercise control over the entities that own the entertainment business and the Montral Canadiens and make required payments and fund cash flow deficiencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position and our combined results of operations.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Index to Financial Statements
Consolidated Financial Statements:
        The preparation, integrity and objectivity of the financial statements and all other financial information included in this annual report are the responsibility of the management of Molson Coors Brewing Company. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, applying estimates based on management's best judgment where necessary. Management believes that all material uncertainties have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed.
        The established system of accounting procedures and related internal controls provide reasonable assurance that the assets are safeguarded against loss and that the policies and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel.
        PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, provide an objective, independent audit of the consolidated financial statements. Their accompanying report is based upon an examination conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, including tests of accounting procedures and records.
        The Board of Directors, operating through its Audit Committee composed of independent, outside directors, monitors the Company's accounting control systems and reviews the results of the Company's auditing activities. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly, either separately or jointly, with representatives of management, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and internal auditors. To ensure complete independence, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the Company's internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and may meet with or without the presence of management.
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Adolph Coors Company:
        We have completed an integrated audit of Adolph Coors Company's 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
        In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Adolph Coors Company and its subsidiaries at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule (not presented herein) listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2004 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
        Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (not presented herein) appearing under Item 9A
Controls and Procedures
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2004, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
        A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
Denver, Colorado March 10, 2005, except for Note 5, Note 20, and Note 21 which are as of September 9, 2005
1.     Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
        On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. ("Molson"). In connection with the Merger (the "Merger"), Adolph Coors Company became the parent of the merged company and changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of us includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC), principally a holding company, its operating subsidiaries, Coors Brewing Company (CBC), operating in the United States (U.S.); Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating in the United Kingdom (U.K.); and our other corporate entities.
        Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report excludes Molson (with the exception of our interests in joint ventures entered into previously with Molson, discussed in Note 4), operating in Canada and Brazil, and is presented in U.S. Dollars (USD).
Fiscal Year
        Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Sunday in December. Fiscal years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002, were all 52-week periods.
Principles of Consolidation
        Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be affected.
Reclassifications
        Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2003 and 2002 financial statements to conform to the 2004 presentation.
Revenue Recognition
        Revenue is recognized in the United States segment when product is shipped and the risk of loss transfers to our customers, which are principally independent distributors or wholesalers in the United States. Revenue is recognized in the Europe segment when product is received by our customers, who are principally independent retailers in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, excise taxes are included in the purchase price we pay the vendor on beverages for the factored brands business purchased from third parties for resale and are included in our cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupon programs are treated as a reduction of sales. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms.
        Outside of unusual circumstances, if product is returned, it is generally for failure to meet our quality standards, not caused by customer actions. Products that do not meet our high quality standards
are returned and destroyed. We do not have standard terms that permit return of product. We estimate the costs for product returns and record those costs in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income each period. We reduce revenue at the value of the original sales price in the period that the product is returned.
Cost of Goods Sold
        Our cost of goods sold includes beer raw materials, packaging materials (including promotional packaging), manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound and outbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing, and internal transfer costs.
Equity Method Accounting
        We generally apply the equity method of accounting to 20% to 50% owned investments where we exercise significant influence, except for certain joint ventures that must be consolidated as variable interest entities under FIN46R. These investments primarily involve equity ownership in transportation services in Europe; and investments in ventures that manufacture, distribute and sell Coors Light in Canada and Molson branded beers in the United States. Refer to Note 4 to these consolidated financial statements for descriptions of these investments.
        Effective with the Merger, the non-consolidated joint venture that distributed and sold Coors Light in Canada was dissolved and its activities were assumed by the Molson Canadian beer business.
        There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments as of December 26, 2004.
Cost Method Investment
        In 1991, we became a limited partner in the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club, Ltd. (Baseball Partnership) formerly known as the Colorado Baseball Partnership 1993, Ltd. for an investment of $10.0 million, which gave us a 17.1% interest in the partnership. Our use of the cost method for this investment is permitted under the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46 (EITF D-46) "
Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments
" as we entered into the limited partnership agreement in 1991. As a limited partner, we take no part in control, management, direction or operation of the affairs of the Baseball Partnership and have no power to bind the Baseball Partnership. Profit and loss from operations of the Baseball Partnership are allocated among the partners in accordance with their ownership ratios. We did not receive any cash distributions or income in 2004, 2003 or 2002. We believe that the carrying amount of our investment in the Baseball Partnership is not in excess of fair value.
        In July 2003, the Baseball Partnership signed a $2.1 million promissory note with Coors. Each partner's loan amount was based on their ownership percentage. Ownership percentages in the partnership did not change. The note is due in 20 years and interest will be paid at 5% annually. The principal amount is recorded in other non-current assets.
        In September 2004, an additional investor purchased a limited partnership interest in the Baseball Partnership. The purchase did not change the terms of our limited partnership agreement. However, it did reduce our sharing ratio to 14.60% as of December 26, 2004.
Marketing, General and Administrative
        Our marketing, general and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising, sales staff costs, and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. The creative portion of our advertising
activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs are generally expensed when the advertising is first run. Cooperative advertising expenses are included in marketing, general and administrative costs. Advertising expense was $627.4 million, $588.2 million, and $586.2 million for years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Prepaid advertising costs of $27.9 million ($17.7 million in current and $10.2 million in long-term) and $30.6 million ($13.0 million in current and $17.6 million in long-term) were included in other current and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, respectively.
Trade Loans
        CBL extends loans to retail outlets that sell our brands. Some of these loans provide for no interest to be payable, and others provide for payment of a below market interest rate. In return, the retail outlets receive smaller discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased from us, with the net result being CBL attaining a market return on the outstanding loan balance. Trade loan receivables are classified as either other receivables or non-current notes receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, total loans outstanding, net of allowances, were $128.6 million and $148.3 million, respectively.
        We have reclassified a portion of beer revenue into interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these loans. In 2004 and 2003, this amount was $16.0 million and $17.2 million, respectively. We have included this interest income in the Europe segment since it is related solely to the Europe business.
        We have reclassified cash flows from trade loans of $28.1 million, $15.3 million, and $13.6 million from operating to investing in the cash flow statements for the years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002, respectively.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        In the United States segment, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the U.S. accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom collection occurs through electronic funds transfer. Also, in the U.S., we secure substantially all of our product sale credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds, personal guarantees and other letters of credit.
        Because the majority of CBL sales are directly to retail customers and because of the industry practice of making trade loans to customers, our ability to manage credit risk in this business is critical. At CBL, we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers. Generally, provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer at the point the account is considered uncollectible. At this time, we record the provision as a bad debt in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off.
        We are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and, if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate, our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables and trade loans could be materially affected.
Inventories
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all inventories in the United States and on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method in the United Kingdom. Current cost in the United States, determined on the FIFO method, exceeded LIFO cost by $40.1 million and $38.6 million at December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, respectively.
        We regularly assess the shelf-life of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications.
Dispense Assets
        CBL owns and maintains the dispense equipment in on-trade retail outlets. Dispense equipment, which moves the beer from the keg in the cellar to the glass, is capitalized at cost upon installation and depreciated on a straight-line basis over an average life of 7 years. Labor and materials used to install dispense equipment are capitalized and depreciated over 2 years. Dispense equipment awaiting installation is held in inventory and valued at the lower of cost or market. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
        The carrying amounts of our current financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value of long-term obligations for derivatives was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using market interest rates and does not differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Assuming current market rates for similar instruments, the fair value of long-term debt exceeds the carrying value by approximately $110.4 million.
Foreign Currency Translation
        Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
Stock-Based Compensation
        We use the intrinsic value method when accounting for options issued to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
(APB No. 25), and related interpretations. Accordingly, we do not recognize compensation expense related to employee stock options, since options are always granted at a price equal to the market price on the day of grant. Compensation expense recorded in the financial statements relates to grants of restricted stock, and beginning in the second quarter of 2004, contingently issuable shares of stock granted to key executives, which were issued on December 31, 2004. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation"
(SFAS No. 123) to stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model:
        As a result of shifts in exercise patterns, we adjusted the expected term for stock options issued in 2004 to 7.0 years for options granted to Section 16b officers and to 3.5 years for other option grantees, from 5.4 years for all option holders in 2003 and 2002. We amortize pro forma expense on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of three years.
Statement of Cash Flows Data
        Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. The following presents our supplemental cash flow information:
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (Revised 2004)
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R) was revised in December 2004 and will be effective for us in the third quarter of 2005. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123R when it became effective in 1996 but, as discussed above, continue to account for stock options under APB No. 25. Currently, under an exemption written into the guidance for
qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, SFAS No. 123 requires us to present pro forma share-based compensation expense for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We expect to choose the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, therefore, beginning in the third quarter of 2005, we will be required to record these costs in our income statement. While under current guidance we have used the Black Scholes method to calculate pro forma compensation expense, the new guidance will also allow a binomial method. We are evaluating the alternative methods to value stock options.
        The Merger triggered immediate vesting of all stock options, including those to acquire Molson stock held by Molson option holders (excluding certain options held by the former Molson CEO, as discussed in Note 20). The vesting of Coors options will be reflected in the notes to the first quarter financial statements as pro forma expense in the notes and the vesting of the Molson options will be reflected in Molson's historical financial statements, pre-Merger. Therefore, compensation expense recognized beginning in the 2005 third quarter will only reflect new option grants after the Merger, and could be impacted by unvested stock options held by the former Molson CEO that are yet unvested, and provisions of change in control agreements.
SFAS No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" (Revised)
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 128 (SFAS No. 128) is expected to be revised. We adopted SFAS No. 128 when it became effective in 1997 and will adopt its revised provisions when those provisions become effective, currently anticipated during our first quarter of 2005. For our year-to-date diluted calculations, we currently use a quarterly average stock price. Under the new revisions to SFAS No. 128, we will be required to use a year-to-date average stock price. When stock prices are increasing year-to-date, as has been the case for our company stock in 2004, the effect of the revision to the standard will be to increase dilution. For example, if we had implemented the revision in 2004, our year-to-date diluted earnings per share would have been $0.03 per share lower. The new standard will require retrospective presentation of diluted earnings per share upon implementation, meaning that prior periods' earnings per share will be adjusted to conform to the same method of calculation.
SFAS No. 151 "Inventory Costs"
        SFAS No. 151 is an amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that will be effective for us in fiscal 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage to require that those costs be expensed currently, as opposed to being included in overhead costs. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 151 will have on our financial results when implemented.
SFAS No. 153 "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets"
        SFAS No. 153 is an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29 that will be effective for us in the third quarter of 2005. The standard tightens the general exception for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our financial results when implemented.
2.     Mergers and Acquisitions
Merger with Molson Inc.
        The Merger transaction and subsequent debt financing are discussed in Note 20, Subsequent Events. Preliminary accounting for the acquisition is underway.
Acquisition of CBL
        On February 2, 2002, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Bass Holdings Ltd. and certain other intangible assets from Interbrew, for a total purchase price of 1.2 billion (approximately $1.7 billion at then prevailing exchange rates), plus associated fees and expenses. The acquisition supported one of our key strategic goals of growing our beer business internationally to broaden our geographic platform; diversify revenues, profits and cash flows and increase our brand portfolio, which we believe will significantly enhance our competitive position in a consolidating worldwide beer industry.
        One of the factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill was the existence of financial and operating synergies. In addition to these synergies, there were a number of other factorsincluding the existence of a strong management team, a proven track record of introducing and marketing successful brands, an efficient sales and distribution system, complementary products and a good sales force.
        The business, renamed CBL, included the majority of the assets that previously made up Bass Brewers, including the Carling, Worthington's and Caffrey's beer brands; the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland distribution rights to Grolsch (via and subject to the continuation of a joint venture arrangement, in which CBL has a 49% interest, with Royal Grolsch N.V.); several other beer and flavored-alcohol beverage brands; related brewing and malting facilities in the United Kingdom; and a 49.9% interest in the distribution logistics provider, Tradeteam. CBL is the second-largest brewer in the United Kingdom based on total beer volume, and Carling lager is the best-selling beer brand in the United Kingdom. The brand rights for Carling, which is the largest acquired brand by volume, are mainly for territories in Europe. The addition of CBL creates a stronger, broader, more diversified company in a highly competitive and consolidating global beer market.
        The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
        We finalized the purchase price accounting relative to the CBL acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002. Of the $415 million of acquired intangible assets, approximately $390 million was assigned to brand names and distribution rights. The remaining $25 million was assigned to patents and technology and distribution channels. Approximately $286 million of the $390 million brand name and distribution rights value has been determined to have an indefinite life and accordingly is not being amortized. The remaining $104 million brand names and distribution rights value are amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately 12 years. The $25 million value for patents and technology and distribution channels are amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately 8 years.
        The fair value of the acquired intangible brand assets was determined primarily from the discounted value of projected cash flows. A weighted average cost of capital of 8.75% was used to discount projected cash flows. Cash flows were projected using management's best estimates of sales growth or declines for each brand over its expected life. The lives of the assets were determined by an evaluation of significant factors that could impact the life of the brand.
        The cost approach was used to determine the value of the customer base using the estimated cost to recruit a customer. Technology, unfavorable leaseholds, contracts and other less significant intangible assets were valued using a present value approach of the returns or costs of the underlying assets. Goodwill was valued using the residual method.
        Goodwill of $637 million was assigned to the Europe and United States segments in the amounts of approximately $522 million and $115 million, respectively (See Note 11, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for further discussion of allocation). None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in the U.K., but all intangible assets are being amortized in the calculation of U.S. earnings and profits. A valuation allowance of approximately $40 million was recorded against deferred tax assets arising from the acquisition.
        We funded the acquisition with approximately $150 million of cash on hand and approximately $1.55 billion of debt as described below at the prevailing exchange rate as of the date of acquisition:
        In conjunction with the term loan and bridge facility, we incurred financing fees of approximately $9.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. These fees were amortized over the respective terms of the borrowings using the effective interest method. On May 7, 2002, we repaid our nine-month bridge facility through the issuance of long-term financing. We also repaid the balance of our GBP-denominated amortizing term loan during 2003. See Note 12, Debt, for further information about debt-related activity.
3.     Variable Interest Entities
        The FASB finalized
FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesAn Interpretation of ARB51 (FIN46R)
in December 2003, making the new guidance applicable to us in the first quarter of 2004. FIN46R expands the scope of ARB51 and can require consolidation of "variable interest entities (VIEs)." Once an entity is determined to be a VIE, the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. We have investments in VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we have consolidated three joint ventures in 2004, effective December 29, 2003, the first day of our 2004 fiscal year. These include Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC) and Grolsch (U.K.) Limited (Grolsch). The impacts to our balance sheet include the addition of net fixed assets of RMMC and RMBC totaling approximately $65 million, RMMC debt of approximately $40 million, and Grolsch net intangibles of approximately $20 million (at current exchange rates). The most significant impact to our cash flow statement for the year ended December 26, 2004, was to increase depreciation expense by approximately $13.2 million and cash recognized on initial consolidation of the entities of $20.8 million. The impact to our income statement was to reduce U.S. segment cost of goods sold, reclassify Europe
segment costs out of cost of goods sold into marketing, general and administrative expense and to increase corporate interest expense. Our partners' share of the operating results of the ventures is eliminated in the minority interests line of the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Results of operations and financial position from prior periods have not been restated as a result of the adoption of FIN46R.
Rocky Mountain Bottle Company
        RMBC is a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens) in which we hold a 50% interest. RMBC produces glass bottles at our glass manufacturing facility for use at our Golden brewery. Under this agreement, RMBC supplies our bottle requirements, and Owens has a contract to supply the majority of our bottle requirements not met by RMBC. In 2003 and 2002, our share of pre-tax joint venture profits for this venture, totaling $7.8 million and $13.2 million, respectively, was included in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. RMBC is a non-taxable entity. Accordingly, income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income only includes taxes related to our share of the joint venture income.
Rocky Mountain Metal Container
        RMMC, a Colorado limited liability company, is a joint venture with Ball Corporation (Ball) in which we hold a 50% interest. We have a can and end supply agreement with RMMC. Under this agreement, RMMC supplies us with substantially all the can and end requirements for our Golden brewery. RMMC manufactures these cans and ends at our manufacturing facilities, which RMMC is operating under a use and license agreement. In 2003 and 2002, our share of pre-tax joint venture profits (losses), totaling $0.1 million and ($0.6) million, respectively, was included in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. RMMC is a non-taxable entity. Accordingly, income tax expense on the accompanying statements of income only includes taxes related to our share of the joint venture income. Upon consolidation of RMMC, debt of approximately $40 million was added to our balance sheet. As of December 26, 2004, Coors is the guarantor of this debt.
Grolsch
        Grolsch is a joint venture between CBL and Royal Grolsch N.V. in which we hold a 49% interest. The Grolsch joint venture markets Grolsch branded beer in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The majority of the Grolsch branded beer is produced by CBL under a contract brewing arrangement with the joint venture. CBL and Royal Grolsch N.V. sell beer to the joint venture, which sells the beer back to CBL (for onward sale to customers) for a price equal to what it paid, plus a marketing and overhead charge and a profit margin. In 2003 and 2002, our share of pre-tax profits for this venture, totaling $3.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, was included in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Grolsch is a taxable entity in the United Kingdom. Accordingly, income tax expense on the accompanying statements of income includes taxes related to the entire income of the venture. Upon consolidation, net fixed assets of approximately $4 million and net intangibles of approximately $20 million were added to our balance sheet.
        The following summarizes the relative size of our consolidated joint ventures (including minority interests):
(1)
Substantially all such sales are made to the Company, and as such, are eliminated in consolidation.
(2)
Excludes receivables from the Company.
Trigen
        In 1995, we sold a power plant located at the Golden brewery to Trigen-Nations Colorado LLLP, including nearly all the fixed assets necessary to produce energy for the brewery operations. All output from the power plant is sold to Coors at rates consisting of fixed and variable components. We have no investment in Trigen but, due to the nature of our relationship with Trigen, we believe we may have a variable interest as defined by FIN 46R. We have no legal right or ability to receive or review financial information for the activity that occurs at the power plant. As a result, after exhaustive efforts, we were unable to conclude as to whether the activity which occurs at the power plant is a variable interest entity, and if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary as defined by FIN 46R (see Note 18).
4.     Equity Investments and Other Income, net
        The following summarizes information regarding our other equity investments that we have determined are not required to be consolidated under FIN46R:
Non-Majority-Owned Equity Investments:
Molson USA, LLC (MUSA)
        In January 2001, we entered into a joint venture partnership agreement with Molson Inc. (Molson), and paid $65.0 million for a 49.9% interest in the joint venture. The joint venture, Molson USA, LLC, was formed to import, market, sell and distribute Molson's brands of beer in the United States. We account for this joint venture by using the equity method of accounting. We recognize our share of the joint venture results in the other income, net, line in our Consolidated Statements of Income, given the immateriality of its results. We believe our maximum exposure to loss over the required ownership period to be $42 million. We have determined that, while Molson USA is a variable
interest entity as defined by FIN46R, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity. As a result of the Merger, we will be consolidating Molson USA, LLC in 2005.
Tradeteam
        Tradeteam was formed in 1995 by CBL (then Bass Brewers Limited) and Exel Logistics. CBL has a 49.9% interest in this joint venture. The joint venture operates a system of satellite warehouses and a transportation fleet for deliveries between CBL breweries and customers. Tradeteam also delivers products for other U.K. brewers. Our share of pre-tax joint venture results has been included in the other income, net, line of our Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in 2003, given the commencement of significant third party trade and immateriality of its results. Prior to 2003, our share of pre-tax joint venture results was included in cost of goods sold. We do not believe there is a significant exposure to loss in our current relationship over our expected ownership period. We have determined that Tradeteam is not a variable interest entity as defined in FIN46R.
Majority-Owned, Non-Consolidated Equity Investment:
        Molson Coors Canada Inc. (MCC), formerly Coors Canada, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, formed a partnership, Coors Canada, with Molson to market and sell our products in Canada beginning in 1998. MCC and Molson had a 50.1% and 49.9% interest, respectively, in Coors Canada. Under the partnership agreement, Coors Canada was responsible for marketing our products in Canada, and contracted with Molson for brewing, distribution and sales of these brands. In December 2000, the partnership and licensing agreements between Molson and Coors were extended for an indefinite period and included the addition of Molson performance standards for the Coors brand. Coors Canada received an amount from Molson generally equal to net sales revenue generated from our brands less production, distribution, sales and overhead costs related to these sales. Our share of pre-tax income from this partnership is included in Sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Although we believe Coors Canada is a variable interest entity, we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity. For the year ended December 26, 2004, Coors Canada meets the definition of a significant subsidiary of Molson Coors, as defined by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As Coors Canada is not consolidated, we are required to provide audited financial statements for Coors Canada supplemental to this Form 10-K. We will file this supplemental information as an amendment to the Form 10-K. As a result of the Merger, Coors Canada was transferred into the business in Canada, and will carry on the Coors Light business in Canada.
        Summarized condensed balance sheet information for Coors Canada is as follows:
        Summarized condensed income statement information for Coors Canada is as follows:
Other Income, net
(1)
Relates to income (loss) from Tradeteam and MUSA.
(2)
In 2004, under a court settlement, we received past due royalty payments of $4.8 million for an operation we no longer own, but for which we were owed royalties. Due to uncertainty regarding collection, we have been recognizing income as payments were received. We will no longer receive royalties from this operation.
(3)
Includes non-operating real estate sales, net of losses, as discussed below.
Sale of Real Estate to Cabela's
        On December 23, 2004, we sold 80 acres of land at our Golden brewery site to Cabela's, upon which they intend to build a retail sporting goods store. A gain of $3.2 million is included in Other income. The contract also calls for Cabela's to reimburse Coors for costs we will incur to reclaim a former gravel pit.
        We expect to recognize an additional $2.1 million gain before reclamation expense of approximately $1.0 million, in future years as we receive reimbursement from Cabela's for the amounts exceeding the pre-existing reclamation liability.
South Table Mountain Land Sale
        On December 12, 2004, we sold real estate on South Table Mountain, adjacent to the Golden brewery, to Jefferson County of Colorado. The property will be preserved as public open space. We received $9.9 million in cash, and recorded an $8.2 million gain that is included in Other Income.
5.     Segment and Geographic Information
        In the first quarter of 2005, in conjunction with the Merger, we re-categorized our operations into four operating segments: the United States, Europe, Canada and Brazil. The information below has been reclassified to present our historical results on the basis of our new operating segments. The United States and Europe segments are managed by separate operating teams, and each consists of the manufacture, marketing, and sale of beer and other beverage products. Prior to the Merger, the Canada segment consisted of our 50.1% interest in the Coors Canada partnership through which the Coors Light business in Canada was conducted. The partnership contracted with Molson for the brewing, distribution and sale of our products. Coors Canada managed all marketing activities for our products in Canada. In connection with the Merger, Coors Canada was dissolved into the Canadian business. There was no activity in the Brazil segment prior to the Merger.
        No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales.
        Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table:
(1)
Related primarily to interest on trade loans.
(2)
Represents royalty income form Coors Canada (Note 4).
        Following is a reconciliation of amounts shown as income before income taxes, after minority interests, to income before income taxes and net income shown on the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2004. Minority interests exist in 2004 due to the consolidation of certain variable interest entities as a result of the adoption of FIN46R (Note 3). 2003 and 2002 reconciliations are not necessary, as no minority interests are presented for those fiscal years.
(1)
Depreciation, depletion and amortization amounts do not reflect amortization of bond discounts, fees, or other debt-related items.
(2)
Capital expenditures include additions to properties and intangible assets, excluding assets acquired in the CBL purchase in 2002.
        The following tables represent sales and long-lived assets by geographic segment:
(1)
Net sales attributed to geographic areas is based on the location of the customer.
(2)
Long-lived assets include net properties.
6.     Income Taxes
        The pre-tax income on which the provision for income taxes was computed is as follows:
        Income tax expense (benefit) includes the following current and deferred provisions:
        Our income tax expense varies from the amount expected by applying the statutory federal corporate tax rate to income as follows:
        Our deferred taxes are composed of the following:
        During 2002, in connection with the purchase of CBL, we recorded a deferred tax liability on the books of CBL and a corresponding deferred tax asset on the books of the acquiring company for the difference between the purchase price and historical basis of the CBL assets. Concurrently, we recorded a $40.0 million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In 2004, we evaluated the valuation allowance and determined no adjustment was required.
        We do not provide deferred taxes on certain outside basis differences in our acquired foreign subsidiary's stock, Coors Brewers Limited (CBL). This outside basis difference is permanent in duration
under SFAS 109 because we do not intend to take any action that would result in recognizing the gain inherent in certain book-over-tax basis differences.
        We have not presumed any earnings from foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested under APB No. 23 and, therefore, we have provided deferred taxes on those amounts. Beginning in 2005 we anticipate repatriating a portion of our foreign earnings.
        Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2004 was 29.9%, down from 33.1% a year ago. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 30.9% down from 31.2% for the prior year due primarily to lower income tax on our U.K. business. These lower taxes result largely from the fact that the incremental U.S. tax recorded on the U.K. income is recorded on the business's earnings and profits. Earnings and Profits is computed in accordance with U.S. tax standards resulting in lower earnings being subjected to U.S. tax due in large part to the amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill, which are not deductions for U.S. GAAP.
        Our effective tax rate can be volatile due in large part to the difficulty in projecting the earnings and profits amount, which is impacted by many different factors.
        We have not yet completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As such, we are not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Based on our analysis to date it is possible we may repatriate some amount between $50 million and $60 million of U.K. earnings, which will result in an estimated decrease to our accrued liability for U.S. tax on unremitted earnings of between $7.0 million and $8.4 million respectively. We expect to complete our evaluation of these repatriation provisions in the third quarter of 2005.
        The FASB is currently considering changes to accounting for uncertain tax positions. Because the nature and extent of the changes are not fully known we are not able to predict the impact on our tax contingency reserve. We are evaluating our longer-term tax rate in light of the Molson Merger and expect to complete our analysis of the impact of the Merger during 2005.
        Our 2003 effective tax rate was impacted by the favorable completion of federal tax audits for the years 1996 through 2000. Based on our current analysis, we believe our remaining income tax contingency reserves are adequate to address other worldwide income tax issues.
7.     Special Items, net
Cape Hill Brewery Sale
        We sold our Cape Hill brewery property in May 2004 for 26 million (approximately $50 million at current exchange rates), with 6 million payable to us in 2004 and 20 million due in 2005, resulting in a one-time pretax gain of approximately 4 million ($7.5 million, which has been included in Special items on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income). We recorded an insignificant portion of the ultimate gain in the second quarter of 2004 under the installment method. We recorded the remaining gain on sale in the fourth quarter of 2004 after the remaining 2004 payment was received. The note receivable is included in other current receivables.
        In 2002, we recorded charges related to the closing of our Cape Hill brewery, which were included as part of our purchase accounting upon the acquisition of CBL. Closure of the Cape Hill brewery commenced in July 2002 with the shut down of the kegging line. All production ceased in December 2002, at which time the assets, which were included in properties, were reclassified as held-for-sale. No impairment was taken on the assets, as their market value exceeded their carrying value. The payment of severance and other termination benefits started in July 2002 and was completed in December 2004. We reduced goodwill for unpaid restructuring liabilities upon full gain recognition in December 2004. The closure of the Cape Hill brewery was possible as a result of the cessation of the
production contract for Interbrew U.K. Ltd., which was in existence upon acquisition of CBL. The annual savings from the Cape Hill closure, net of the loss of income from the Interbrew U.K. Ltd production contract, approximates 11 million (approximately $20 million), reflected primarily in cost of goods sold and generally in line with expectations.
2002 Special Items
        During 2002, we incurred net pretax special charges of $6.3 million. We recorded special charges of $2.7 million related to acquisition costs for CBL, including accounting, appraisal and legal fees. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.8 million related to cash payments received on a debt due to us from our former partner in a brewing business in South Korea. We also incurred net restructuring charges of $6.4 million primarily related to restructuring initiatives in our U.S. operations and Golden Brewery business in an effort to consolidate and lower our future overhead costs. The restructuring charges consisted primarily of employee severance costs, which were paid during 2003. We estimate annual savings from the U.S./Golden restructuring programs approximate $10 million, reflected primarily in cost of goods sold.
8.     Container Outsourcing Arrangement
        CBL outsourced the ownership, procurement and tracking of its approximately 1.2 million kegs and casks with TrenStar, Inc. in the second quarter of 2004. TrenStar acquired CBL's keg and cask inventory and will provide ongoing container management services for CBL in the United Kingdom, including installation of radio frequency identification tags on each container and the use of container tracking technology under a 15-year service agreement. We received a cash payment of approximately 28 million ($50 million at second quarter exchange rates) for our U.K. keg and cask inventory. An insignificant loss was recognized on the sale.
9.     Stock Activity and Earnings Per Share
        Coincident with the Merger, our capital stock terms were changed. A description of our new capital structure is provided in Note 20, Subsequent Events.
Capital Stock
        Prior to the Merger, at a special meeting of our shareholders in October 2003, Class A and Class B shareholders voted to approve a proposal that resulted in a change of our place of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware. The change was beneficial to us, due to Delaware's comprehensive, widely used and extensively interpreted corporate law. The re-incorporation did not result in any change in our name, headquarters, business, jobs, management, location of offices or facilities, number of employees, taxes payable to the State of Colorado, assets, liabilities, or net worth. However, the par value of all our classes of stock changed to $0.01 per share, effective in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a reclassification of amounts from par value to paid-in capital.
        From October 2003 to the effective date of the Merger, both classes of common stock had the same rights and privileges, except for voting, which (with certain limited exceptions) was the sole right of the holder of Class A common stock.
        At December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002, 25 million shares of no par value preferred stock were authorized but unissued.
        Pursuant to our former by-laws, restricted Class B shares we required to first be offered to us for repurchase. The board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40 million per year of our outstanding Class B common stock on the open market during 2002; however, no repurchases of either restricted shares or from the open market were authorized for 2003 and 2004.
        Basic and diluted net income per common share was arrived at using the calculations outlined below:
        The dilutive effects of stock options were determined by applying the treasury stock method, assuming we were to purchase common shares with the proceeds from stock option exercises. Anti-dilutive securities were not included in our calculation because the stock options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during the periods presented.
10.   Properties
        The cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization consists of the following:
        Land, buildings and machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated principally on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements, 10 to 40 years; and machinery and equipment, 3 to 20 years. Certain equipment held under capital lease is classified as equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term. Lease amortization is included in depreciation expense. Expenditures for new facilities and improvements that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized. Start-up costs associated with manufacturing facilities, but not related to construction, are expensed as incurred. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
        We capitalize certain software development costs that meet established criteria, in accordance with Statement of Position, "
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Systems Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
," (SOP 98-1). We amortize software costs over 3-5 years. During 2004 and 2003, we placed into service approximately $44.0 million of software assets related to our supply chain processes and systems implementation. Software development costs not meeting the criteria in SOP 98-1, including system reengineering, are expensed as incurred.
11.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets
        The following tables present details of our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 26, 2004:
        The following tables present details of our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 28, 2003:
        Based on December 2004 average foreign exchange rates, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:
        Amortization expense of intangible assets was $25.1 million, $22.2 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002, respectively.
        Upon the acquisition of CBL on February 2, 2002, we recorded $637 million of goodwill. The total goodwill was determined using the residual method under SFAS No. 141 and 142. This goodwill was allocated between our Europe and United States segments based on which segment would benefit from certain synergies created by the acquisition. A portion of the acquired goodwill was attributable to operating and financial synergies resulting from the combination. The financial synergy goodwill was calculated by comparing the risk premiums expected by investors associated with the CBC business with and without the CBL acquisition. This synergy was then associated with the segments based on an analysis of the Europe segment with and without the weighted average cost of capital differential as well as the two segments' relative earnings contributions. Operating synergies were allocated to reporting units based on where the savings were expected to occur. Application of this methodology resulted in the following allocations:
        Goodwill was allocated between our reportable segments as follows:
        Changes in our goodwill from December 28, 2003 to December 26, 2004 and from the acquisition date were the result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
        SFAS 142 stipulates that we are required to perform goodwill and other intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances. We completed the required impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets under SFAS 142 during the third quarter of 2004 and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset was impaired.
        In addition, goodwill related to our joint venture investment with Molson, totaling approximately $61 million, was evaluated during 2004 under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock
," (APB No. 18), and found not to be impaired. As a result of the Merger, we will consolidate our Molson investment and reclassify our related investments in joint ventures in goodwill.
12. Debt
(1)
Our short-term borrowings consist of various uncommitted lines of credit. At December 26, 2004, we had two USD uncommitted lines of credit totaling $50 million. We had $12.5 million and $7.0 million outstanding under these lines of credit as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively. Amounts outstanding under the lines of credit bear interest at a rate stated by the lenders. The interest rate at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, was 2.95% and 1.80%, respectively. We also had three uncommitted lines of credit totaling 30.0 million, or approximately $57.7 million based on foreign exchange rates at December 26, 2004. These lines of credit bear interest at a floating rate determined by the lenders. At December 26, 2004, there was no balance outstanding and at December 28, 2003, the balance outstanding totaled $11.9 million. The interest rate at December 28, 2003, was 4.30%. In addition, we have two uncommitted lines of credit totaling 1.1 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $10.6 million, at December 26, 2004. Interest rates are below 1% and amounts outstanding totaled $2.4 million at December 28, 2003. There was no balance outstanding at December 26, 2004.
(2)
At December 28, 2003, we had $20.0 million in unsecured senior notes that were due July 2005. We repaid the notes, in full in 2004.
(3)
On May 7, 2002, CBC completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 6/% senior notes, due 2012, with interest payable semi-annually. The notes were priced at 99.596% of par for a yield to maturity of 6.43%, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund provision and include a redemption provision (make-whole provision) if the notes are retired before their scheduled maturity. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and (2) the make whole amount of the notes being redeemed, which is equal to the present value of the principal amount of the notes and interest to be redeemed. The notes were issued with registration rights and are guaranteed by Molson Coors Brewing Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting fees, were approximately $841 million. The net proceeds were used to (1) repay the $750 million of loans outstanding under our senior unsecured bridge facility, which we entered into in connection with our acquisition of CBL and (2) to repay approximately $91 million of outstanding term borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities. We have also entered into hedges related to these borrowings, which are further described in Footnote 17, Derivative Instruments.

8
Simultaneous with the private placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we exchanged the unregistered notes for substantially identical notes registered with the SEC. The exchange of all the notes was completed on September 16, 2002.
Under the terms of the notes, we must comply with certain restrictions. These restrictions include restrictions on debt secured by certain types of mortgages, secured certain threshold percentages of consolidated net tangible assets, and restrictions on certain types of sale-leaseback transactions. As of December 26, 2004, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions.
(4)
At December 28, 2003, we had $86.0 million outstanding on an unsecured senior credit facility consisting of a U.S. dollar-denominated amortizing term loan. We paid the outstanding balance off in full during the first quarter of 2004. In connection with the repayments on our term loan, we accelerated the amortization of fees associated with the loan, resulting in a $0.4 million charge to interest expense during the first quarter of 2004.
(5)
In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million in commercial paper. At December 26, 2004, and December 28, 2003, we had $0 million and $250 million outstanding, respectively. As of December 28, 2003, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings ranged 1.24% to 1.27%, with a weighted average of 1.255%. As of December 26, 2004, none of our total $500 million unsecured committed credit arrangement was being used as a backstop for our commercial paper program. This line of credit has a five-year term expiring 2007.
(6)
Our other notes payable consist of a CBL note payable totaling approximately $21 million and denominated in Euros that existed at the time of the CBL acquisition; and a note payable totaling approximately $41 million issued by our RMMC joint venture (See Note 2 and 3). The CBL note bears interest at 5.39% and matures in October 2005. The RMMC notes bear interest at 7.20% and mature in December 2013. CBC guarantees the RMMC notes.
The aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings for the next five fiscal years are as follows:
Interest
        Interest incurred, capitalized and expensed were as follows:
13. Stock Option, Restricted Stock Award and Employee Award Plans
        At December 26, 2004, we had three stock-based compensation plans, which are described in greater detail below. We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our plans. Accordingly, as the exercise prices upon grant are equal to quoted market values, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option portion of the plans.
Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
        The Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (EC Plan) provides for awards of the Company's Class B shares of restricted stock or options for Class B shares. Awards vest after completion of the director's annual term. The compensation cost associated with the EC Plan is amortized over the director's term. Compensation cost associated with this plan was immaterial in 2004
,
2003, and 2002. Common stock authorized for the EC Plan as of December 26, 2004, was 60,000 shares.
The 1990 Plan
        The 1990 Equity Incentive Plan (1990 EI Plan) generally provides for two types of grants: stock options and restricted stock awards for our employees. The stock options have a term of 10 years and one-third of the stock option grant vests in each of the three successive years after the date of grant. Total authorized shares of Class B common stock for issuance under the 1990 EI Plan were 15.0 million shares at December 26, 2004.
        A summary of the status of the option portion of our 1990 EI Plan and EC Plan, combined, is presented below:
        The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
        As a result of shifts in exercise patterns, we adjusted the expected term for stock options issued in 2004 to 7.0 years for options granted to Section 16b officers and to 3.5 years for other option grantees, from 5.4 years for all option holders in 2003 and 2002. We amortize pro forma expense on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of three years.
        The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 26, 2004:
        As a result of shifts in exercise patterns, we adjusted the expected term for stock options issued in 2004 to 7.0 years for options granted to Section 16b officers and to 3.5 years for other option grantees, from 5.4 years for all option holders in 2003 and 2002. We amortize pro forma expense on a straight-line basis over the option-vesting period of three years.
        We issued 3,000 and 13,000 shares of restricted stock in 2003 and 2002, respectively, under the 1990 EI Plan. We issued no restricted stock in 2004. All restrictions on these shares lapse effective with the Merger on February 9, 2005. As a result, any remaining compensation cost associated with these awards will be recognized during the first quarter of 2005. Compensation cost associated with these awards was insignificant in 2004, 2003, and 2002.
        In May 2002, the Company approved a stock award to be issued contingent upon certain debt reduction milestones as of December 31, 2004. The number of shares to be issued under this incentive plan was 100,870. As the debt reduction goals were met under this award, the shares were issued on December 31, 2004. Compensation expense totaling $7.6 million was recognized ratably from May through December 2004, as it was probable that the shares would be earned and issued on December 31, 2004.
14. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
15. Employee Retirement Plans
Defined Benefit Plans
        The Company has U.S. and U.K. pension plans that cover substantially all its employees. Benefits for all employees are generally based on salary and years of service. Plan funding strategies are influenced by employee benefits laws and tax laws. The Company's U.K. plan includes provision for employee contributions and inflation-based benefit increases for retirees. Total defined benefit pension plan expense was $43.7 million, $38.7 million and $18.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in pension expense from 2003 to 2004 was due to a decline in discount rates and actuarial losses due to higher than expected early retirements. The increase in pension expense from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to the decline in the market value of plan investments that occurred from 2000 through 2002. Although pension investment returns were significant in 2003, the impact of the three previous years' returns and a continued decline in interest rates reduced the funded positions of the plans to a level that resulted in the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses. In addition, service cost for the U.K. plan in U.S. dollars increased due to the appreciation of the GBP against the dollar. The aggregate funded position of the Company's plans resulted in the recognition of an additional minimum liability in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
        Both U.S. and U.K. plan assets consist of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds and real estate. Equity assets are well diversified between international and domestic investments, with additional diversification in the domestic category through allocations to large-cap, small-cap, and growth and value investments. Relative allocations reflect the demographics of the respective plan participants. The following compares target asset allocation percentages as of February 25, 2005 with actual asset allocations at December 26, 2004:
        Investment return assumptions for both plans have been determined by applying the returns to assets on a weighted average basis and adding an active management premium where appropriate.
        Although we don't expect any required contributions to our plans, it is expected that contributions to the U.S. plans during 2005 will be approximately $41.1 million (including supplemental executive plans), and contributions to the U.K. plan during 2005 will be approximately 19.3 million ($37.1 million) (U.K. plan contributions translated to USD at December 26, 2004 rates).
        The following represents our net periodic pension cost:
        The changes in the projected benefit obligation and plan assets and the funded status of the pension plans are as follows:
        Pension expense is actuarially calculated annually based on data available at the beginning of each year. Assumptions used in the calculation include the settlement discount rate selected and disclosed at the end of the previous year as well as other assumptions detailed in the table below.
(1)
Rate selected at year-end for the following year's pension expense and related balance sheet amounts at current year-end.
Expected Cash Flows
        Information about expected cash flows for the consolidated retirement plans follows:
Purchase Price Adjustments
        In July 2004, we received 14 million (approximately $26 million at then-current exchange rates) from Interbrew, related to mistakes in pension participant data when CBL was purchased in 2002. The corrected data increased our pension liability at the time of the acquisition (approximately 21 million or $38 million at then-current exchange rates). Goodwill associated with the purchase price of CBL was adjusted for the change in the pension liability and for the cash collected from Interbrew during the third quarter. The net effect of adjusting goodwill for the pension liability and the cash received was insignificant. The effect on equity was to increase other comprehensive income by $26.8 million, net of tax, due to a decrease in the minimum pension liability adjustment. The effect of the adjustment to pension expense will be to increase the interest component of annual service cost by approximately 1 million or $2 million.
Defined Contribution Plan
        U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Coors Savings and Investment Plan, a qualified voluntary defined contribution plan. We match 50% of the employees' contributions up to 6% of employee compensation. Both employee and employer contributions are made in cash in accordance with participant investment elections. There are no minimum amounts that are required to be invested in CBC stock. Our contributions in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $7.2 million, $6.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively.
Multiemployer Plan
        Certain of our employees in Memphis participate in a union multi-employer union retirement plan, into which we make contributions on behalf of our Memphis employees. Contributions totaled $1.9 million, $2.4 million and $3.0 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. We recently announced our intention to close the Memphis facility (Note 20). We are currently evaluating our obligations under the multi-employer plan as a result of this action.
16.   Postretirement Benefits
        CBC has postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents. The plans are not funded.
        The obligation under these plans was determined by the application of the terms of medical and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates ranging ratably from 11.00% in 2004 to 5.00% in 2009. The discount rate used in determining the projected postretirement benefit obligation was 5.50% and 6.00% at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively.
        The changes in the benefit obligation of the postretirement benefit plans are as follows:
(1)
We changed certain insurance providers during 2004, which resulted in a reduction in our benefit obligation.
Expected Cash Flows
        Information about expected cash flows for the consolidated post-retirement plans follows:
        Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
17.   Derivative Instruments
        In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, the value of foreign currencies and production and packaging materials prices. We have established policies and procedures that govern the strategic management of these exposures through the use of a variety of financial instruments. By policy, we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation.
        Our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and production and packaging materials prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and prices. To achieve this objective, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the values of which change in the opposite direction of the anticipated cash flows. We do not hedge the value of net investments in foreign-currency-denominated operations or translated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the British Pound Sterling (GBP), the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the Japanese yen (YEN).
        Derivatives are either exchange-traded instruments or over-the-counter agreements entered into with highly rated financial institutions. No losses on over-the-counter agreements due to counterparty credit issues are anticipated. All over-the-counter agreements are entered into with counterparties rated no lower than A (S&P) or A2 (Moody's). In some instances our counterparties and we have reciprocal collateralization agreements regarding fair value positions in excess of certain thresholds. These agreements call for the posting of collateral in the form of cash, treasury securities or letters of credit if a fair value loss position to our counterparties or us exceeds a certain amount. At December 26, 2004, no collateral was posted by our counterparties or us.
        All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets or other non-current assets. Unrealized loss positions are recorded as other liabilities or other long-term liabilities. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are classified in the income statement consistent with the classification of the corresponding income or expense line item being hedged.
        The majority of all derivatives entered into by the Company qualify for, and are designated as, foreign-currency cash flow hedges, commodity cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, including those derivatives hedging foreign currency denominated firm commitments as per the definitions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
, as amended and interpreted, incorporating FASB Statements No. 137, 128 and 149" (SFAS No. 133).
        The Company considers whether any provisions in non-derivative contracts represent "embedded" derivative instruments as described in SFAS No. 133. As of December 26, 2004, we have concluded that no "embedded" derivative instruments warrant separate fair value accounting under SFAS No. 133.
        Changes in fair values of outstanding derivatives that are highly effective as per the definition of SFAS 133 are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged transaction. In most cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be released to earnings at maturity of the related derivative. The recognition of effective hedge results in the consolidated statement of income offsets the gains or losses on the underlying exposure.
        We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges and commodity cash flow hedges either to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis,
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.
        We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative is no longer highly effective, as per SFAS No. 133, in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
        When we discontinue hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet until maturity, recognizing future changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness, as per SFAS No. 133, is recorded in current-period earnings. During 2004 and 2003, we recorded an insignificant loss relating to such ineffectiveness of all derivatives in Other income, net. Effectiveness is assessed based on the comparison of current forward rates to the rates established on our hedges.
        As of December 26, 2004, $7.8 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months as a result of expected gains or losses on underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in earnings. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings are dependent on the applicable rates in effect when derivatives contracts that are currently outstanding mature. As of December 26, 2004, the maximum term over which we are hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for all forecasted and recorded transactions is 10 years.
        We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging instruments and do not enter into master netting arrangements. The counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings of at least A, A2 or better. However, this does not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines that are monitored and reported to management according to prescribed guidelines. We utilize a portfolio of financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries we conduct our business. As a result of the above considerations, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.
        As of December 26, 2004, we are a party to certain cross currency swaps totaling 530 million GBP (approximately $774 million at the date of entering the transaction). The swaps included an initial exchange of principal on the settlement date of our 6/% private placement fixed rate debt (see Note 12, Debt) and will require final principal exchange in May 2012. The swaps also call for an exchange of fixed GBP interest payments for fixed U.S. dollar interest receipts. At the initial principal exchange, we paid U.S. dollars to a counterparty and received GBP. Upon final exchange, we will provide GBP to the counterparty and receive U.S. dollars. The cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future GBP interest and principal

receipts that results from changes in the U.S. dollar to GBP exchange rates on an intercompany loan between our Europe subsidiary and us.
        We entered into interest rate swap agreements related to our 6/% fixed rate debt. The interest rate swaps convert $201.2 million notional amount from fixed rates to floating rates and mature in 2012. We will receive fixed U.S. dollar interest payments semi-annually at a rate of 6/% per annum and pay a rate to our counterparty based on a credit spread plus the three-month LIBOR rate, thereby exchanging a fixed interest obligation for a floating interest rate obligation. There was no exchange of principal at the inception of the swaps. We designated the interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge of the changes in the fair value of the $201.2 million fixed rate debt attributable to changes in the LIBOR swap rates.

18.   Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit
        As of December 26, 2004, we had approximately $12.1 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions. These letters expire at different points in 2005, but contain a feature that automatically renews the letters for an additional year if no cancellation notice is submitted. These letters of credit are being maintained as security for reimbursements to insurance companies, for deductibles or retention payments made on our behalf, and for operations of underground storage tanks.
Power Supplies
        In 1995, Coors Energy Company (CEC), a wholly owned subsidiary, sold a power plant located at the Golden brewery location to Trigen-Nations Energy Company, LLLP (Trigen). We have an agreement to purchase substantially all of the electricity and steam produced by Trigen and needed to operate the brewery's Golden facilities through 2020. Our financial commitment under this agreement is divided between a fixed, non-cancelable cost, which adjusts annually for inflation, and a variable cost, which is generally based on fuel cost and our electricity and steam use. Total purchases, fixed and variable, under this contract in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $33.5 million, $32.1 million, and $28.0 million, respectively.
Supply Contracts
        We have various long-term supply contracts with unaffiliated third parties and our joint venture partners to purchase materials used in production and packaging, such as starch, cans and glass. The supply contracts provide that we purchase certain minimum levels of materials throughout the terms of the contracts. The approximate future purchase commitments under these supply contracts are:
        Our total purchases under these contracts in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $273.4 million, $422.2 million, and $441.7 million, respectively.
U.S. Logistics Contract
        In the U.S., we have consolidated portions of our warehousing into two separate contracts with Exel Logistics, Inc. The contracts provide for warehousing services in Ontario, California and Golden, Colorado under seven and five year operating agreements with Exel Logistics, respectively. We have committed to $2.6 million in operating expenses to these contracts in 2005. Annual reviews of the scope of services with Exel Logistics will determine pricing in future years, limited to 3% increases annually.
England and Wales Distribution Contract
        Tradeteam Ltd., the joint venture between CBL and Exel Logistics, Inc. has an exclusive contract with CBL to provide distribution services in England and Wales until at least 2010. The approximate future financial commitments under the distribution contract are as follows:
        The financial commitments on termination of the distribution agreement are to essentially take over property, assets and people used by Tradeteam to deliver the service to CBL, paying Tradeteam's net book value for assets acquired.
U.K. Container Operations
        CBL outsourced the ownership, procurement and tracking of its approximately 1.2 million kegs and casks with TrenStar, Inc. in the second quarter of 2004. The approximate future financial commitments under the kegging outsource contract are as follows:
Graphic Packaging Corporation
        We have a packaging supply agreement with a subsidiary of Graphic Packaging Corporation (GPC), a related party under which we purchase our paperboard requirements. Our purchases under the packaging agreement in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately $104.5 million, $106.4 million and $111.0 million, respectively. We expect purchases in 2005 to be approximately the same as 2004. Related accounts payable balances included in Affiliates accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $3.4 million and $5.0 million as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively.
Advertising and Promotions
        We have various long-term non-cancelable commitments for advertising and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events. At December 26, 2004, these future commitments are as follows:
Leases
        We lease certain office facilities and operating equipment under cancelable and non-cancelable agreements accounted for as operating leases. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows:
        Total rent expense was $30.6 million, $14.3 million and $22.5 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Environmental
        When we determine that it is probable that a liability for environmental matters or other legal actions exists and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the future costs are recorded as a liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company-owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred.
        We are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Lowry Superfund site. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver (Denver), and is managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (Waste Management). In 1990, we recorded a pretax charge of $30 million, a portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with Denver and Waste Management regarding the then outstanding litigation. Our settlement was based on an assumed cost of $120 million (in 1992 adjusted dollars). We are obligated to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount.
        In January 2004, Waste Management provided us with updated annual cost estimates through 2032. We reviewed these cost estimates, in the assessment of our accrual related to this issue. We used certain assumptions that differ from Waste Management's estimates to assess our expected liability. Our expected liability (based on the $120 million threshold being met) is based on our best estimates available.
        The assumptions used are as follows:
 - 
trust management costs are included in projections with regard to the $120 million threshold, but are expensed only as incurred,
 - 
income taxes, which we believe not to be an included cost, are not included in projections with regard to the $120 million threshold,
 - 
a 2% inflation rate for future costs, and
 - 
certain operations and maintenance costs were discounted using a 4.60% risk-free rate of return.
        Based on these assumptions, the present value and gross amount of the discounted costs are approximately $1.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively. Accordingly, we believe that the existing accrual is adequate as of December 26, 2004. We did not assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of our liability.
        Considering the estimates extend through the year 2032 and the related uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies, and what costs are included in the determination of when the $120 million threshold is reached the estimate of our liability may change as facts further develop. We cannot predict the amount of any such change, but additional accruals in the future are possible.
        We are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware.
        From time to time, we have been notified that we are or may be a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws for the cleanup of other sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. We cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total cost, the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage.
        While we cannot predict the eventual aggregate cost for environmental and related matters in which we are currently involved, we believe that any payments, if required, for these matters would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material in any one year to our operating results, cash flows or our financial or competitive position. We believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable.
Litigation
        Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. The suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to "children and other underage consumers." In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will vigorously defend this litigation and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in the lawsuits.
        As with any transaction of the size and nature of the Merger, contingencies could be identified, and we are undertaking a review to determine whether any such contingencies exist.
        We are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, none of these disputes and legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters, including the above-described advertising practices case, may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
Insurance
        We are self-insured for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of employee health insurance programs, as well as workers' compensation, general liability, automobile liability and property insurance deductibles or retentions. During 2004 we fully insured future risks for long-term disability, and, in most states, workers' compensation, but maintained a self-insured position for workers' compensation for certain self-insured states and for claims incurred prior to the inception of the insurance coverage in Colorado in 1997.
19. Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)
        The following summarizes selected quarterly financial information for each of the two years in the period ended December 26, 2004:
20. Subsequent Events
        On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company and Molson Inc. ("Molson") consummated a merger according to the terms and conditions of a Combination Agreement (the "Merger"). The transactions contemplated by the Merger were approved by shareholder vote and were effected through a court-approved plan of arrangement in Canada (the "Plan of Arrangement"). In connection with the Merger, Adolph Coors Company changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. The combined company will have a diverse product offering of more than 70 owned and licensed brands in key
markets throughout the world. Management has identified annual synergies that the combined Company can achieve, including the closing of the Memphis plant (discussed below), in addition to administrative, strategic sourcing and other cost reductions.
        The merger's equity consideration was valued at $3.6 billion, including the exchange of 46.7 million equivalent shares of stock at a market price of $75.25 per share, the exchange of stock options valued at $4.0 million, and merger-related costs incurred by Coors. Coors was considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger, requiring the purchase consideration to be allocated to Molson's net assets, with the residual value to goodwill. We are in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets and of pension and other liabilities, and analyzing other market or historical information for certain estimates for purposes of preparing our purchase price allocation. Accordingly, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to change.
        The Merger was approved at a special meeting of the shareholders of Molson on January 28, 2005 and a separate meeting of Molson option holders on January 27, 2005, and amendments to the certificate of incorporation and a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, special Class A voting stock and special Class B voting stock (and any shares convertible into or exchangeable for shares of that stock) were approved by the Coors shareholders on February 1, 2005. The Merger was effected through an exchange of stock, in which Molson shareholders received stock in the new Molson Coors Brewing Company according to an exchange ratio, depending upon the type of stock held. Also, Molson shareholders were permitted to receive a combination of common stock and exchangeable shares in the new company. Canadian resident holders who received exchangeable shares in the Merger may electively defer paying taxes on the transaction until such time as they exchange the shares for common stock or otherwise dispose of them.
        In the Merger, Molson shareholders received the following:
        
Molson Class A Shareholders.    
A holder of Molson Class A non-voting shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.360 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Exchangeco (and ancillary rights), or
 - 
through a series of exchanges, 0.360 of a share of Class B common stock of Molson Coors, or
 - 
a combination of Class B exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of Class B common stock.
        
Molson Stock Option Holders.    
A holder of Molson stock options was permitted to exchange each such Molson option for a 0.36 Molson Coors option, each. Approximately 1.3 million options were issued by Molson Coors in the Merger.
        
Molson Class B Shareholders.    
A holder of Molson Class B common shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.126 of a Class A exchangeable share and 0.234 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Exchangeco (and ancillary rights), or
 - 
through a series of exchanges, an aggregate of 0.360 of a share of Molson Coors common stock, comprised of 0.126 of a share of Class A common stock and 0.234 of a share of Class B common stock, or
 - 
a combination of exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of Molson Coors common stock.
        Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders, excluding Pentland (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party), also received a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") of Cdn. $5.44 per share, or a total of approximately Cdn. $652 million (U.S.$523 million) paid by Molson in connection with the Merger to Molson shareholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2005. Included in the number of outstanding shares of Molson's common stock were approximately 1.4 million shares issued upon the exercise of options to purchase Molson Class A common stock by Molson's directors and senior management between January 28, 2005 and February 8th. Therefore, the Special Dividend was Cdn.$12 million higher than previously disclosed due to the increase in Molson's outstanding Class A common stock as a result of the exercise of options. As discussed below, the special dividend was financed through additional debt.
        At its January 28, 2005 meeting, in light of the amount of work involved in completing the Merger transaction, the Board of Directors of Molson authorized payments of: Cdn. $50,000 (U.S. $39,800) to each of the then outside directors of Molson; Cdn. $50,000 (U.S. $39,800) to the chairs of the Independent Committee and Human Resources Committee; and Cdn. $845,000 (U.S. $672,630) in aggregate payments to executive officers and certain other employees of Molson. All Merger-related expenses incurred by Molson prior to the Merger were expensed as incurred. As of December 26, 2004, Merger costs incurred by Molson, excluding the bonus payments, were approximately Cdn. $24.0 million.
Debt Structure
        Standard & Poors downgraded our credit rating from BBB+ to BBB subsequent to the Merger. Concerns regarding the health of the Brazilian and Canadian businesses influenced this decision, in addition to the debt burden as a result of the special dividend. Our Moody's credit rating is Baa2.
        A special dividend equal to Cdn. $652 million ($523 million) was paid to the holders of record of Molson stock on February 8, 2005, as a condition for completing the Merger. As a result, the newly combined company has increased its debt obligations to pay the dividend.
        In February 2005, we entered into a $1.3 billion bridge loan credit facility available in both Canadian Dollars and Euros, which was initially used to re-finance the payment of the special dividend debt incurred by Molson immediately prior to the Merger and to refinance various issues of Molson's existing debt. The bridge loan borrowings accrue interest at variable rates, which are indexed to the CDOR (Canadian Depository Overnight Rates), plus a spread based on Molson Coors' long-term bond rating. The bridge loan credit facility expires in February 2006.
        In March 2005, we entered into a $1.4 billion revolving multicurrency bank credit facility, which was used to refinance the special dividend debt and a portion of the bridge loan credit facility. Draws against the credit facility accrue interest at variable rates, which are based upon CDOR, plus a spread based upon Molson Coors' long-term bond rating and facility utilization. The credit facility expires in March 2010. We plan to replace this facility with long-term debt.
Changes to Pension and Retiree Medical Benefit Plans
        In February 2005, we announced changes to both the U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for a certain portion of pension eligible employees. The defined benefit formula will change, effective June 30, 2005, from a) a calculation of a percentage multiplied by the product of years of service and a period-defined highest average salary to b) a calculation of a percentage multiplied by all accumulated earnings following June 30, 2005. This change is expected to generally reduce pension costs in the future. Based upon a $40 million contribution to the defined
pension plan in 2005, our expense will be reduced by approximately $4 million in 2005. With regard to the defined contribution plan, the Company will increase its matching contributions from $0.50 per $1.00 contributed to $0.75 per $1.00 contributed, up to 5% of base pay. This change to the defined contribution plan is expected to partially offset the pension expense savings resulting from the changes made to the defined benefit plan formula. We are also eliminating a cap on Company contributions to our retiree medical plan for employees retiring after June 2005, which was scheduled to go into effect in 2009. It is estimated that this plan change will increase our retiree medical obligation by $11.6 million and increase 2005 expense by $2.5 million.
Memphis Closure
        In February 2005, we announced plans to close our Memphis, Tennessee brewery, with the shutdown process to begin later in 2005 and to be completed by 2007. The closure is among the initiatives that are expected to achieve the $175 million in cost synergies outlined when the Merger was announced in July 2004. Cost savings are expected to be in the range of $32 to $35 million annually when the closure is complete. To effect this change, we will invest $70 to $90 million in capital expenditures in our North American network, along with restructuring and other costs that will be finalized nearer the closing of the Memphis facility.
Rights on Change in Control
        Twelve Coors officers elected to leave the Company following the Merger as a result of their exercising rights under change in control agreements. Costs associated with the departure of these officers included $18.3 million of severance and related cash benefits, $3.1 million of pension benefits, and $5.8 million of non-cash stock compensation expense associated with changes to these officers' stock options.
        Coors had agreements with executive officers, and certain other members of management relating to a change of control of Coors. The Merger constituted a change in control of Coors under these agreements as the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust no longer had sole voting control of Coors, and as the Board of Directors of the merged company no longer had a majority of directors who were directors of Coors prior to the Merger. These agreements generally provided for continued compensation and benefits for a period of two years following the year of the change of control.
        In addition, these employees were entitled to severance benefits if triggering events specified in the agreement occurred. Upon a triggering event (such as the Merger), the officer would receive a multiple of annual salary and bonus and continued health, pension and life insurance benefits. For executives and officers who exercise their rights under the agreements, stock option exercises are subject to a floor price equal to the price of Coors' stock on the date of the change of control.
        For each of Coors' then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the compensation includes a payment for the rest of the current year plus three times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, plus benefits for the equivalent of three years coverage, plus three years credit for additional service toward pension benefits. For all other executive officers with these agreements, the compensation includes a payment for the rest of the current year plus two times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, plus two years equivalent benefit coverage, plus vesting and credit for two years additional service toward pension benefits.
        The Company offered retention benefits to employees covered by the change in control agreements (except for both Coors' then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer), in return for forfeiting their rights under the agreements. Twelve affected employees exercised their rights under the
change in control agreements. Corporate Special Charges will include approximately $27.2 million accrued for departing employees under this plan. Costs of the retention plan are being recognized ratably over the period that the employees remain with the Company and earn their retention bonuses. These costs will be included in future operating results and will total approximately $7.2 million over a two-year period. The President/Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Molson Coors Brewing Company remain parties to change in control agreements that existed prior to the Merger, which provide for a thirteen month period in which the executives can exercise their rights under the agreements.
Departure of Principal Officer
        Daniel J. O'Neill, Vice-Chairman, Synergies and Integration will leave the Company in May of this year. Under the terms of a separation agreement, Mr. O'Neill will receive about $4.5 million in cash compensation, consisting of three years of salary and a special bonus. Mr. O'Neill's 288,000 stock options with an option price of about $68 per share, and 18,000 restricted shares will vest at such time if vesting restrictions are satisfied.
Shareholder Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry
        Beginning in May 2005, several purported class actions were filed in the United States and Canada, including in Delaware federal courts and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleging, among other things, that, the Company and its affiliated entities, including Molson Inc., and certain officers and directors misled shareholders by failing to disclose first quarter (January-March) 2005 U.S. business trends prior to the merger vote in January 2005. The Company believes that the lawsuits are without merit and will vigorously defend them.
        The Company has been contacted by the Central Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Denver (the "SEC") requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other information from the Company and Molson Inc. relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related to the February merger, the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2005 and other information. The SEC has advised the Company that this inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred, nor should it be considered a reflection upon any person, entity, or security. The Company is cooperating with the inquiry.
21. Supplemental Guarantor Information
        On May 7, 2002, our wholly owned subsidiary, CBC (Issuer), completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 6/% Senior notes due 2012. The notes were issued with registration rights and were guaranteed on a senior and unsecured basis by Molson Coors Brewing Company (Parent Guarantor) and certain domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors). The guarantees are full and unconditional, and joint and several. A significant amount of the Issuer's income and cash flow is generated by its subsidiaries. As a result, funds necessary to meet the Issuer's debt service obligations are provided in large part by distributions or advances from its subsidiaries. Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, as well as our financial condition and operating requirements and those of certain domestic subsidiaries, could limit the Issuer's ability to obtain cash for the purpose of meeting its debt service obligation including the payment of principal and interest on the notes.

        Simultaneously with the private placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we registered the exchange of the notes for substantially identical notes. The exchange of all the notes was completed on September 16, 2002.
        The following information sets forth our Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheet as of December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003 and the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Income and Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2004, December 28, 2003, and December 29, 2002. Investments in our subsidiaries are accounted for on the equity method; accordingly, entries necessary to consolidate the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and all of its subsidiaries are reflected in the elimination column. Separate complete financial statements of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors would not provide additional material information that would be useful in assessing their financial composition.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATIONUPDATED FOR PROPOSED DEBT OFFERING
        The following tables present historical, supplemental guarantor financial information as if new debentures were issued by a finance subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, (other than Coors Brewing Company, the issuer of Existing Notes) with Molson Coors Brewing Company serving as a parent guarantor. The subsidiary presented as the Issuer of New Notes is Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC, a wholly-owned, Canadian entity created in connection with the Merger, which has short-term borrowings totaling $977.8 million as of June 26, 2005. In this scenario, Coors Brewing Company and Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC serve as guarantors of each others' notes. Subsidiary Guarantors, as presented below, are all other U.S. domestic subsidiaries of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC had no activity prior to our fiscal 2005.

ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
(Concluded)
1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
        On February 9, 2005, Adolph Coors Company merged with Molson Inc. In connection with the merger (the "Merger"), Adolph Coors Company became the parent of the merged company and changed its name to Molson Coors Brewing Company. Unless otherwise noted in this report, any description of us includes Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC or "the Company"), principally a holding company, and its operating subsidiaries: Coors Brewing Company (CBC), operating in the United States (U.S.); Coors Brewers Limited (CBL), operating in the United Kingdom (UK); Molson Inc. (Molson), operating in Canada; Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (Kaiser), operating in Brazil; and our other corporate entities. Any reference to "Coors" means the Adolph Coors Company prior to the Merger. Any reference to Molson Inc. means Molson prior to the Merger. Any reference to "Molson Coors" means MCBC, after the Merger.
Restatement of Financial Statements as of and for the Thirteen Weeks Ended March 27, 2005
        The condensed consolidated balance sheet at March 27, 2005 and the condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three months then ended have been restated as a result of errors in accounting for income taxes due to the following:
 - 
The restatement corrects errors in accounting for income taxes related to purchase accounting for a deferred tax asset, and the interperiod allocation of a change in an income tax contingency accrual. The error related to the purchase accounting adjustments pertains to the acquisition of Coors Brewers Limited in 2002. As part of the purchase accounting, a U.S. deferred tax asset was recorded to reflect the anticipated future foreign tax credits expected to result from the U.K. taxable income that will be generated by the reversal of U.K. deferred tax liabilities. The Company has re-evaluated the purchase accounting and has determined that recording this deferred tax asset was not appropriate as it did not represent either a tax carryforward or a difference in the book and tax bases of the net assets at the time the purchase accounting adjustments were recorded. The impact of the misstatement on the Company's balance sheet is an overstatement of the long-term deferred tax asset account of $140 million, with a corresponding understatement of goodwill of $142 million at March 27, 2005. The impact of this misstatement is not material to the consolidated balance sheets for 2002, 2003, or 2004. This error resulted in immaterial misstatements in the Company's reported income tax provision for the years ended December 29, 2002 and December 26, 2004. The cumulative impact of the error was an $8.7 million ($0.14 per diluted share) understatement of income tax expense. This income tax provision misstatement was the result of changes in U.K. deferred taxes being offset by U.S. deferred taxes, for which the offsetting adjustment was made to increase the above referenced deferred tax asset, with a corresponding reduction of income tax expense. While these entries were consistent with the position the Company had taken in regard to the deferred tax asset reflecting the foreign taxes that could be credited in the U.S. (a change in deferred taxes in the foreign jurisdiction would result in a corresponding change in the foreign tax credits that could be credited in the U.S.), these entries were in error once it was determined that the deferred tax asset recorded in purchase accounting was in error. As the impact of this error was immaterial to prior annual periods, and the correction is immaterial to the expected results for the full-year 2005, it has been recorded in the restated financial statements for the quarter ended March 27, 2005.
 - 
The recording of the deferred tax asset also resulted in an $11.7 million ($0.19 per diluted share) understatement of the income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2005, related to a tax rate reduction enacted in the Netherlands (a subsidiary of the U.K. group) during the first quarter. This reduction in foreign taxes was originally offset by a corresponding change in the U.S. deferred taxes as described in the above paragraph.
 - 
The second error in the 2005 first quarter income tax benefit related to an interperiod tax allocation error for certain items, primarily reductions in reserves for tax contingencies, that were included in the calculation of the 2005 annual effective tax rate, as opposed to being properly considered as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2005. The effect of failing to treat these items as discrete items in computing the 2005 first quarter income tax benefit resulted in a $9.4 million ($0.15 per diluted share) understatement of income tax benefit.
Unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
        The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and certain variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary (See Note 8). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 26, 2004. The results of operations for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year and cannot be used to indicate financial performance for the entire year.
        The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements.
Reporting Periods Presented
        The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include the results of Molson and Kaiser prior to the Merger on February 9, 2005. Further, the results of Kaiser are reported one month in arrears since the date of the Merger for this and future reporting periods, which means, for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, Kaiser's results include only the results for the months of February through May 2005.
Use of estimates
        Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements are affected.
Reclassifications
        Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2004 financial statements to conform to 2005 presentation.
Stock-based compensation
        We use the intrinsic value method when accounting for options issued to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board No. 25, "
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
(APB No. 25), and related interpretations. Accordingly, we do not recognize compensation expense related to employee stock options, since options are always granted at a price equal to the market price on the day of grant. Compensation expense recorded in the financial statements relates to grants of restricted stock, which were contingent upon reaching certain debt reduction goals by December 31, 2004, and other executive incentive plans. In 2005, stock compensation expense includes variable plan accounting expense related to change in control benefits. (See related Note 5). Additional, pro-forma expense represents vesting of stock options, including the former Coors and Molson options that immediately vested at the Merger. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation"
(SFAS No. 123) to stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes valuation model:
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS 123R, "Share-Based Payment" (Revised 2004)
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 (SFAS No. 123R) was revised in December 2004. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 when it became effective in 1996 but, as discussed above, continue to account for stock options under APB No. 25. Currently, under an exemption written into the guidance for qualifying stock option grants with no intrinsic value on the date of grant, SFAS No. 123 requires us to present pro forma share-based compensation expense determined under the fair value approach for our stock option program in the notes to our financial statements. We expect to choose the modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS No. 123R, therefore, beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we will be required to record these costs in our income statement. While under current guidance we have used the Black Scholes method to calculate
pro forma compensation expense, the new guidance will also allow a binomial method. We are evaluating the alternative methods to value stock options and do not know the impact of changing our current method.
SFAS No. 151 "Inventory Costs"
        SFAS No. 151 is an amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 that will be effective for us in fiscal 2006. The standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage to require that those costs be expensed currently, as opposed to being included in overhead costs. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 151 will have on our financial results when implemented.
SFAS No. 153 "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets"
        SFAS No. 153 is an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29 that will be effective for us in the third quarter of 2005. The standard tightens the general exception for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe that the standard will have a significant impact on our financial results when implemented.
SFAS No. 154 "Accounting for Changes and Error Correctionsa Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3"
        SFAS No. 154 was issued in June 2005 and requires retrospective application of voluntary changes in accounting principles, unless impracticable. SFAS No. 154 supersedes the guidance in APB Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3; but does not change any transition provisions of existing pronouncements. Generally, elective accounting changes will no longer result in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in the income statement, because the effects of any elective changes will be reflected as prior period adjustments to all periods presented. SFAS No. 154 will be effective beginning with our 2006 fiscal year and will affect any accounting changes that we elect to make thereafter.
FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143"
        FIN No. 47 was issued in March 2005 and clarifies the accounting treatment required when accounting for an asset retirement obligation under SFAS No. 143 that is conditional in nature. FIN 47 will be effective for us at the end of our fiscal 2005. Management is currently reviewing the impact of FIN 47 on our accounting treatment of our asset retirement obligations. Any income statement change that may result from the adoption of FIN 47 would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of 2005.
2.     MOLSON MERGER
Merger Transaction
        The Merger was approved at a special meeting of the shareholders of Molson Inc. on January 28, 2005, and a separate meeting of Molson Inc. option holders on January 27, 2005, and amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, special Class A voting stock and special Class B voting stock (and any shares convertible into or exchangeable for shares of that stock) were approved by the Coors stockholders on February 1, 2005. The Merger was effected through an exchange of stock, in which Molson Inc. shareholders received stock in the new MCBC according to an exchange ratio, depending upon the type of stock held. Also, Molson Inc. shareholders were permitted to receive a combination of common stock of MCBC and exchangeable shares in a subsidiary of MCBC, Molson Coors
Canada, Inc. Canadian resident holders who received exchangeable shares in the Merger could defer paying income taxes on the transaction until such time as they exchange the shares for common stock or otherwise dispose of them.
        In the Merger, Molson Inc. shareholders received the following:
        Molson Class A Shareholders.
    A holder of Molson Class A non-voting shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.360 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Canada (and ancillary rights),
 - 
through a series of exchanges, 0.360 of a share of Class B common stock of MCBC, or
 - 
a combination of Class B exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of Class B common stock.
        Molson Class B Shareholders.
    A holder of Molson Class B common shares who was a Canadian resident for Canadian income tax purposes was permitted to elect to receive for each of those shares:
 - 
0.126 of a Class A exchangeable share and 0.234 of a Class B exchangeable share of Molson Coors Canada (and ancillary rights),
 - 
through a series of exchanges, an aggregate of 0.360 of a share of MCBC common stock, comprised of 0.126 of a share of Class A common stock and 0.234 of a share of Class B common stock, or
 - 
a combination of exchangeable shares (and ancillary rights) and, through a series of exchanges, shares of MCBC common stock.
Molson Stock Option Holders
        A holder of Molson Inc. stock options was permitted to exchange each such Molson Inc. option for 0.36 of a MCBC option to purchase Class B common stock. Approximately 1.3 million options were issued by MCBC in the Merger.
        Molson Class A non-voting and Class B common shareholders, excluding Pentland Securities (a company controlled by Eric Molson, a related party), also received a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") of Cdn. $5.44 per share, or a total of approximately Cdn. $652 million (US $523 million) paid by Molson in connection with the Merger to Molson Inc. shareholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2005. Included in the number of outstanding shares of Molson Inc.'s common stock were approximately 1.4 million shares issued upon the exercise of options to purchase Molson Class A common stock by Molson Inc.'s directors and senior management between January 28, 2005, and February 8, 2005. This resulted in an increase in the Special Dividend of Cdn $12 million (US $10 million) and an increase in Molson Inc.'s outstanding Class A common stock. As discussed below, the Special Dividend was financed through additional debt.
        At its January 28, 2005, meeting, in light of the amount of work involved in completing the merger transaction, the Board of Directors of Molson Inc. authorized additional payments of: Cdn. $50,000 (US $39,800) to each of the then outside directors of Molson Inc.; an additional Cdn. $50,000 (US $39,800) to the chairs of the Independent Committee and Human Resources Committee; and Cdn. $845,000 (US $672,630) in aggregate additional payments to executive officers and certain other employees of Molson Inc. All Merger-related expenses incurred by Molson Inc. prior to the Merger were expensed as incurred.
Reasons for the Merger
        The Merger placed our combined company as the world's fifth largest brewer, by volume, with combined annual volume of approximately 50 million barrels. The combined company offers a diverse offering of more than 70 owned and licensed brands in key markets throughout the world. Management has identified $175 million of annual synergies that the combined company believes it can achieve in stages over the next three years, including the closing of the Memphis plant discussed in Note 5, in addition to administrative, strategic sourcing and other cost reductions.
Pro Forma Results
        As discussed in Note 1, the results of Molson have been included in the consolidated financial statements since February 9, 2005. However, while the Molson results include results from February 9, 2005 through June 26, 2005, the results of Kaiser are reported one month in arrears and include results from February 9, 2005, through May 31, 2005.
        The following unaudited, pro forma information shows the results of our operations for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, as if the Merger had occurred at the beginning of each period. Therefore, the pro forma information includes Molson results for January through June of both periods presented and Kaiser results for December through May of both periods presented to simulate the reporting method we have adopted with respect to Kaiser. The pro forma results include special charges of $171.7 million during the first two quarters of 2005, including $17.4 million of merger-related special charges in the US segment for restructuring costs and accelerated depreciation on the company's Memphis brewery, which will be closed during the next two years; a $3.6 million write-off of obsolete brewery assets in the Europe segment offset by a $3.2 million gain on asset sale, expenses related to tax contingency increases in Brazil totaling $46.7 million, restructuring charges in Brazil of $19.3 million, and Corporate segment special charges totaling $87.9 million, primarily due to change-in-control payments and benefits for 12 former Coors officers who left the company following the Merger. Pro forma results for 2004 include special charges of $43 million, including merger-related Corporate expenses of $24 million, and $19 million in charges related to the closure of sales offices and brewing operations in Brazil.
Preliminary Purchase Accounting
        The Merger's equity consideration was valued at $3.6 billion, including the exchange of 46.7 million equivalent shares of stock at a market price of $75.25 per share, the exchange of stock options valued at $4.0 million, and merger-related costs incurred by Coors. Coors was considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger, requiring the purchase consideration to be allocated to Molson's and Kaiser's net assets, with the residual to goodwill. Management has evaluated many of Molson's assets and liabilities using various methods, including consultation with a third party appraiser. The most significant items for which valuations have not been finalized are pre-existing contractual relationships between Coors and Molson Inc., certain aspects of Molson's investment in the Montreal Canadiens, the value of the Brazil business, the value of Molson's non-owned partner brands whose contracts were impacted by the change in control, and the fixed assets of Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI), a joint venture consolidated under FIN 46. In addition, management is currently evaluating potential restructuring activities that could impact our purchase accounting. Other significant outstanding items include: evaluation of our organizational structure, decisions on outsourcing and other vendor arrangements and determination of the optimal information technology platform. Management is in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives relative to our Brazil operations. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Merger date.
        We have allocated preliminary purchase price to goodwill and intangibles as follows. Overall enterprise values and values of individual intangible assets were determined primarily through the use of discounted cash flow techniques.
Merger-related Debt
        Subsequent to the Merger, we established a $1.0 billion bridge facility which was used to refinance pre-merger Molson debt of approximately $1.5 billion, including that used to finance the Special Dividend and to refinance some of Molson's other pre-merger debt. We had $977.8 million outstanding under the bridge facility at June 26, 2005. The bridge facility is classified as short-term debt. We also established a $1.4 billion, five-year credit facility which was used to refinance a portion of the bridge facility borrowings. We had $310.5 million outstanding under the credit facility at June 26, 2005. Subsequent to establishing both of these facilities, the existing bank facilities at both Molson and Coors were terminated.
Merger-related Other
        Molson sold the Montreal Canadiens professional hockey club (the "Club") to a purchaser in 2001. Molson maintained a 19.9% common ownership interest in the team, as well as a preferred interest, redeemable in 2009. We have determined that, while the Club is a variable interest entity as defined by FIN 46R, we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity. As a result, we account for our interest in the Canadiens using the equity method.
        The shareholders of the Club (the purchaser and Molson) and the National Hockey League (NHL) are parties to a consent agreement, which requires the purchaser and Molson to abide by funding requirements included in the terms of the shareholders' agreement. In addition, Molson has given certain guarantees to the lenders of the purchaser of the Canadiens and the Bell Centre (formerly the Molson Centre), such that in the event that the Canadiens and the purchaser are not able to meet their obligations, or in the event of a default, Molson shall 1) provide adequate support to the purchaser through necessary cash payments so that the purchaser would have sufficient funds to meet its debt obligations, and 2) exercise control of the entity which owns the Club and the entertainment business operated at the Bell Centre at predetermined conditions, subject to NHL approval. The obligations of the purchaser to such lenders were Cdn. $92.0 million at June 26, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, Molson reaffirmed an existing guarantee of the purchaser's payment obligations on a 99-year lease arrangement (which began in 1993) related to the land upon which the Bell Centre has been constructed. Annual lease payments in 2004 were Cdn.$2.4 million, and are based on prevailing interest rates and changes in the consumer price index.
        We have made preliminary estimates of the fair values of the common and preferred equity investments in the Montreal Canadiens, as well as of the guarantee to lenders noted above and a guarantee of payments due under a land lease. We will further evaluate during the allocation period our 19.9% share of any intangible assets that may exist with respect to the investment.
        The preferred equity interest has a stated value of $86.5 million Cdn. (approximately U.S. $69.2 million) and is redeemable in 2009. The land lease has 88 years remaining in its term, with annual payments of $2.4 million Cdn. indexed to inflation. The lessee is an entity owned by the buyer of the Canadiens.
        Molson and Coors were partners in two joint ventures, Coors Canada and Molson USA (MUSA), prior to the merger. EITF 04-1,
Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination,
requires management to determine whether the preexisting contractual relationships were valued at fair value at the merger date. The lesser of any unfavorability to Coors (the acquiring company for purposes of SFAS 141), or the cost to settle the relationship, is to be reflected as an expense just prior to the merger occurring, with the offsetting result of that loss amount not being considered in purchase price accounting. We are evaluating any potential impact of this rule as part of our purchase price accounting process, which is ongoing.
3.     BUSINESS SEGMENTS
        We have realigned our reporting segments as a result of the Merger. For comparative purposes, we have also reclassified amounts in the prior period presentation to the new format.
United States (U.S.)
        The U.S. segment consists of the production, marketing, and sales of the Coors and Molson portfolios of brands in the United States and its territories, and the Caribbean. This segment includes the results of the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC) and Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC) joint ventures consolidated under FIN46R.
Europe
        The Europe segment consists of our production and sale of the CBL brands, principally in the United Kingdom; our joint venture arrangement relating to the production and distribution of Grolsch in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (consolidated under FIN46R); and our joint venture arrangement for the physical distribution of products throughout Great Britain (Tradeteam). It includes the sale of Coors Fine Light Beer in the United Kingdom and Coors Light in the Republic of Ireland. It also includes the small amount of volume that is sold in Asia and Russia.
        In the United Kingdom, in addition to supplying our own brands, we sell other beverage companies' products to our on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. These factored brand sales are included in our financial results, increasing our net sales and cost of goods sold, but the related volume is not included in our reported sales volumes.
Canada
        The Canada segment consists of our production and sale of the Molson brands, principally in Canada; our joint venture arrangement related to the distribution and retail of beer in Ontario, Brewers Retail, Inc. (BRI) (consolidated under FIN46R); our joint venture arrangement related to the distribution of beer in the western provinces, Brewers Distribution Limited (BDL); and the Coors Light business in Canada. The Canada segment also includes our equity interest in the Montreal Canadiens Hockey Club.
        We also distribute, market and sell Corona Extra in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces under agreement with Cerveceria Modelo S.A. de C.V. We have an agreement with Heineken N.V. (Netherlands) which grants us the right to import, market and sell Heineken products throughout Canada and with Miller to brew, market and sell several Miller brands, and distribute and sell imported Miller brands. The Canada segment also has an agreement with Carlton and United Breweries Limited, a subsidiary of Foster's Brewing Group Limited, to brew Foster's Lager in Canada for sale in Canada and the United States. Lastly, the Canada segment has the right to contract produce Asahi for the United States market.
Brazil
        The Brazil segment consists of our production and sale of the Kaiser and Bavaria brands in Brazil.
Corporate
        Corporate includes interest and certain other general and administrative costs that are not allocated to any of the operating segments. Corporate contains no sales or cost of goods sold, although certain royalty income and intangible administrative costs are absorbed by Corporate. The majority of these corporate costs relates to worldwide finance and administrative functions, such as corporate affairs, legal, human resources, insurance and risk management.
        No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales. Inter-segment revenues are insignificant. Following is a reconciliation of amounts shown as income (loss) before income taxes, after
minority interests for each segment, to income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) shown on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
        The following table represents total assets by reporting segment:
4.     EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
        Basic and diluted net income per common share were determined using the calculations outlined below:
        The dilutive effects of stock options were determined by applying the treasury stock method, assuming we were to purchase common shares with the proceeds from stock option exercises. Anti-dilutive stock options totaling 4.6 million and 1.3 million in the thirteen weeks and 2.7 million and 2.6 million in the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively, were not included in our calculation because the stock options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares.
5.     SPECIAL CHARGES
        Largely in connection with the Merger and our related synergy goals, we have incurred charges in the first half of 2005 that are not indicative of our operations. As such, we have separately classified these charges as special operating expenses. By segment, the following items are included in special charges.
US Segment
        The US segment has recognized $17.4 million of special charges in the first half of 2005. $14.4 million of these charges related to accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs incurred in connection with our previously announced plans to close our Memphis facility over the next two years. The remaining $3.0 million includes salaried employee termination costs and other closing costs at Memphis and at our Golden facility, of which expenditures totaling $2.3 million have been made as of June 26, 2005. On July 26, 2005, Molson Coors Brewing Company reached a new labor agreement with the Teamsters Union representing the majority of its workers at the Company's brewery in Memphis, Tenn. The new labor agreement includes terms for a one-time benefit to employees who are involuntarily terminated in connection with the closure of this brewery. Retention and severance costs for the Memphis employees will be accrued over the service period during which such benefits are earned by the employees.
        Plans for shifting production from Memphis to other brewing and packaging facilities and the sequence of the shutdown are currently being finalized. However, the company expects a phase-out of operations to begin during the second half of 2005 and be completed by the first quarter of 2007. Cost savings are anticipated to be in the range of $32-$35 million annually when the closure is complete. To effect this change, the company expects to invest $70-$80 million in capital expenditures in its North American brewery network, along with restructuring and other costs related to the closure of the Memphis facility.
        In conjunction with the plans to close this facility, the Company currently expects to incur approximately $15 million to $25 million in cash expenses, consisting of severance and other employee related costs of approximately $10 million and equipment relocation and other facility transition costs of $5 million to $15 million. The Company also expects to incur non-cash asset impairment related expenses of $75 million to $80 million through accelerated depreciation and one-time asset abandonments. In addition, we may also pay an undetermined amount to the union pension plan when we withdraw our participation. These expenses will be incurred during 2005, 2006 and first quarter of 2007.
        The Molson Coors Memphis brewery currently employs approximately 400 people and brews Coors Light for export, Zima XXX, Blue Moon and Keystone Light.
Europe Segment
        The Europe segment incurred net special charges of $0.4 million during the first half of 2005, which consist of a first quarter 2005 impairment charge for brewing assets in the U.K. totaling $3.6 million, offset by a gain on development of property formerly owned by the Company near the Burton brewing facility in the second quarter of 2005 totaling $3.2 million.
Brazil Segment
        The Brazil segment incurred special charges of $46.7 million to record reserves for contingent liabilities associated primarily with transactional taxes (i.e., non-income taxes). See Note 12.
Corporate Costs
Coors Rights on Change in Control
        Coors had agreements with executive officers, and certain other members of management relating to a change of control of Coors. The Merger constituted a change in control of Coors under these agreements as the Adolph Coors, Jr. Trust no longer had sole voting control of Coors, and as the Board of Directors of the merged company no longer had a majority of directors who were directors of Coors prior to the Merger. These agreements generally provided for continued compensation and benefits for a period of two years following the change of control.
        In addition, these employees were entitled to severance benefits if triggering events specified in the agreement occur. Upon a triggering event, the officer would receive a multiple of annual salary and bonus and continued health, pension and life insurance benefits. For terminated executives and officers, stock option exercises are subject to a floor market price equal to the price of Coors' stock on the date of the change of control. As a result of the drop in our stock price during the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a charge of $13.3 million representing the amount of cash payments that would have been required if terminated officers had exercised options at June 26, 2005. If the price of the Company's stock rises above this option floor, it will result in a reduction to this charge. To the extent the Company's stock price falls below the price on June 26, 2005 additional charges will be necessary. The amount is included in the following table under "Additions."
        For each of Coors' then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the severance benefits if triggered included a payment for the rest of the current year plus three times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, plus benefits for the equivalent of three years coverage, plus three years credit for additional service toward pension benefits. For all other executive officers with these agreements, the compensation includes a payment for the rest of the current year plus two times annual salary, bonus and fringe benefits, two years equivalent benefit coverage, and vesting and credit for two years additional service toward pension benefits.
        The Company offered retention benefits to each employee covered by the change in control agreements (except for both Coors' then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer who subsequently entered into new employment agreements [see Subsequent Events footnote 14]), in return for forfeiting their rights under the agreements. Twelve affected employees declined the retention plan offer. Corporate Special Charges for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 include approximately $49.4 million accrued for departing employees under this plan, which includes $13.3 million related to the option floor benefit. Costs of the retention plan are being recognized ratably over the period that the employees remain with the Company and earn their retention bonuses. These costs will be included in future operating results and will total approximately $7.2 million over a two-year period.
Departure of Other Officers
        During the second quarter of 2005, two other officers (who were former officers of Molson, Inc.) left the Company, resulting in severance benefits. Special charges totaling $14.5 million were recorded in the second quarter related to these and other Molson severance and retention charges in the first half of 2005.
Other Corporate Special Charges
        The remaining special charges consist of Merger-related costs that were incurred by Coors, but did not qualify for capitalization in purchase accounting.
Summary of Special Charges
        The table below details Special Charges in the first half of 2005, by program.
6.     EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
        We offer retirement plans to substantially all our employees in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. As a result of the Merger, we added pension liabilities of approximately $260.0 million and annual pension expense of approximately $13.4 million, including the obligations existing at BRI, which is a joint venture we are required to consolidate under FIN 46R. We incurred approximately $4 million of additional pension expense related to severance and change in control benefits to departing executives in the first half of 2005 which are included in Special Charges (see Note 5). The following summarizes our second quarter 2005 pension expense.
        We expect that contributions to the pension plans during 2005 will be approximately $90.0 million (excluding supplemental executive plans). We expect to contribute approximately $79.9 million to the Canadian plans and approximately $37.1 million to the UK plan in 2005.
7.     CHANGES IN EQUITY AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
        The following summarizes the changes in our capital stock and paid-in capital accounts during the first six months of 2005:
(1)
Includes Exchangeable Class A and B equity, as well as paid in capital.
        The following summarizes the components in other comprehensive income:
8.     VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
        
FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesAn Interpretation of ARB51 (FIN46R)
expands the scope of ARB51 and can require consolidation of "variable interest entities (VIEs)." Once an entity is determined to be a VIE, the party with the controlling financial interest, the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate it. We have investments in VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we have consolidated three joint ventures for all periods presented. These include Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), Rocky Mountain Bottle Company (RMBC) and Grolsch (UK) Limited (Grolsch). We have also consolidated Brewers Retail Inc. (BRI), a joint venture in which Molson participates in Ontario province, effective with the Merger on February 9, 2005.
Rocky Mountain Bottle Company
        RMBC is a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. (Owens) in which we hold a 50% interest. RMBC produces glass bottles at our glass manufacturing facility for use at our Golden brewery. Under this agreement, RMBC supplies our bottle requirements, and Owens has a contract to supply the majority of our bottle requirements not met by RMBC.
Rocky Mountain Metal Container
        RMMC, a Colorado limited liability company, is a joint venture with Ball Corporation (Ball) in which we hold a 50% interest. We have a can and end supply agreement with RMMC. Under this agreement, RMMC supplies us with substantially all the can and end requirements for our Golden brewery. RMMC manufactures these cans and ends at our manufacturing facilities, which RMMC is operating under a use and license agreement. As of June 26, 2005, The Company is the guarantor of approximately $40 million of RMMC debt.
Grolsch
        Grolsch is a joint venture between CBL and Royal Grolsch NV in which we hold a 49% interest. The Grolsch joint venture markets Grolsch branded beer in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The majority of the Grolsch branded beer is produced by CBL under a contract brewing arrangement with the joint venture. CBL and Royal Grolsch NV sell beer to the joint venture, which sells the beer back to CBL (for onward sale to customers) for a price equal to what it paid, plus a marketing and overhead charge and a profit margin.
Brewers' Retail Inc. (BRI)
        BRI is a joint venture beer distribution and retail network for the Ontario region, owned by Molson, Labatt and Sleeman brewers. Ownership percentages fluctuate with sales volumes. At June 26, 2005, Molson's ownership percentage was approximately 52%. BRI operates on a breakeven basis. The three owners guarantee BRI's debt and pension liabilities, which were approximately $175 million and $50 million, respectively, at June 26, 2005.
Trigen
        In 1995, we sold a power plant located at the Golden brewery to Trigen-Nations Colorado LLLP, including nearly all the fixed assets necessary to produce energy for the brewery operations. All output from the power plant is sold to Coors at rates consisting of fixed and variable components. We have no investment in Trigen but, due to the nature of our relationship with Trigen, we believe we may have a variable interest as defined by FIN 46R. We have no legal right or ability to receive or review financial information for the activity that occurs at the power plant. As a result, after exhaustive efforts, we were unable to conclude as to whether the activity which occurs at the power plant is a variable interest entity, and if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary as defined by FIN 46R.
        The following summarizes the relative size of our consolidated joint ventures (including minority interests):
(1)
Substantially all such sales are intercompany, and as such, are eliminated in consolidation.
(2)
BRI results from February 9, 2005, the date of the Merger.
9.     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
        The following tables present details of our intangible assets, other than goodwill as of June 26, 2005:
        The following table presents details of our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 26, 2004:
        The following summarizes the change in goodwill during the first half of 2005 (in millions):
        Based on average foreign exchange rates for the thirteen weeks ended June 26, 2005, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:
        Amortization expense of intangible assets was $14.8 million and $6.8 million for the thirteen weeks and $26.4 million and $11.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively.
        As of June 26, 2005, goodwill was allocated between our reportable segments as follows:
        As discussed in Note 2, we preliminarily allocated $1,850.4 million to goodwill as a result of the Merger. As we are still valuing significant assets and liabilities acquired in the Merger, goodwill allocations shown above are subject to change. See Note 2 for the detailed listing of current values assigned to Molson and Brazil intangibles and goodwill.
10.   DEBT
        Our total long-term borrowings as of June 26, 2005, and December 26, 2004, were composed of the following:
(1)
Our short-term borrowings consist of various uncommitted lines of credit, short-term bank loans, overdraft facilities and a bridge loan facility as summarized below:
(2)
On May 7, 2002, CBC completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 6/% senior notes, due 2012, with interest payable semi-annually. The notes were priced at 99.596% of par for a yield to maturity of 6.43%, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund provision and include a redemption provision (make-whole provision) if the notes are retired before their scheduled maturity. The redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and (2) the make whole amount of the notes being redeemed, which is equal to the present value of the principal amount of the notes and interest to be redeemed. The notes are guaranteed by Molson Coors Brewing Company and certain subsidiaries. Net proceeds from the sale of the notes, after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting fees, were approximately $841 million.

8
Under the terms of the notes, we must comply with certain restrictions. These restrictions include restrictions on debt secured by certain types of mortgages, secured certain threshold percentages of consolidated net tangible assets, and restrictions on certain types of sale-leaseback transactions. As of June 26, 2005, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions.
(3)
In June 2003, we issued approximately $300 million in commercial paper. At June 26, 2005, and December 26, 2004, we had $289.4 million and $0.0 million outstanding, respectively. All of our commercial paper balance is classified as long-term as of June 26, 2005. As of June 26, 2005, and December 26, 2004, the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings ranged from 3.17% to 3.45%, with a weighted average of 3.25%; and from 1.18% to 2.40%, with a weighted average of 1.50%, respectively. As of June 26, 2005, $289.4 million of our total $1.4 billion unsecured committed credit arrangement was being used as a backstop for our commercial paper program [See (5) below]. This line of credit has a five-year term expiring 2010.
(4)
In February 2005, we entered into a $1.0 billion bridge loan credit facility available in both Canadian and U.S. dollars, which was initially used to refinance the payment of the special dividend debt incurred by Molson immediately prior to the Merger and to refinance various issues [See Note 2]. The bridge loan borrowings accrue interest at variable rates, which are indexed to the CDOR (Canadian Dollar Offered Rate), plus a spread based on Molson Coors' long-term bond rating. At June 26, 2005, the interest rate on outstanding borrowing was 3.06% and we had $977.8 million outstanding. The bridge loan credit facility expires in February 2006.
(5)
In March 2005, we entered into a $1.4 billion revolving multicurrency bank credit facility, which was used to refinance a portion of the bridge facility borrowings [See (4) above]. Draws against the credit facility accrue interest at variable rates, which are based upon CDOR, plus a spread based upon Molson Coors' long-term bond rating and facility utilization. At June 26, 2005, the average effective interest rate for all borrowings outstanding was 3.02% and we had $310.6 million outstanding. The credit facility expires in March 2010.
(6)
Other notes payable consist of the following:
11.   INCOME TAXES
        Our effective tax rate for the second quarter is based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate per taxable entity, including evaluation of possible future events and estimated purchase price accounting for the merger with Molson and is subject to subsequent refinement or revision.
        Our second quarter effective tax rate was 53.0%, up from 32.0% a year ago, due primarily to losses in a foreign jurisdiction for which no tax benefit can be recognized for the full year. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 18, we adjust our annual estimated effective tax rate to exclude the impact of these foreign losses. The adjusted estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date pre-tax operating results, exclusive of the results in the foreign jurisdiction, and then adjusted by discrete items to compute income tax expense for the quarter.
        We anticipate that our full year 2005 effective tax rate will be in the range of 38% to 42% due in large part to losses in a foreign jurisdiction for which no tax benefit can be recognized as discussed above. Our tax rate is volatile and may move up or down with changes in, among other items, the amount and source of income or loss, our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, the results of our purchase accounting and changes in the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries.
        We are evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions of Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, but we do not expect that they will have a material impact on our tax expenses.
12.   CONTINGENCIES
Merger
        Kaiser is a party to a number of claims from the Brazilian tax authorities involving federal excise (IPT), social contribution (PIS and COFINS) and value-added state (ICMS) taxes, as well as other civil claims related to employee terminations and commercial matters. Accruals for contingent liabilities in Brazil at June 26, 2005, including interest, totaled $264 million (based on the foreign exchange ratio on June 26, 2005). These contingent liabilities include $203 million recorded as of the Merger date. These estimated liabilities increased to $203 million from the $176 million reported by us in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 27, 2005 due to a 16% appreciation in the Brazilian real versus the US dollar during the second quarter of 2005. During the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a special charge of $46.7 million (based on the foreign exchange rate on June 26, 2005) to increase these estimated contingent liabilities and record additional interest thereon. In addition to the amounts we have recorded, there are $333 million of tax claims where a loss is presently considered either remote or less than probable. This amount increased to $333 million from the $273 million reported by us in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending March 27, 2005 primarily due to the changes in the foreign exchange rate described above. It is possible that actual amounts payable resulting from the claims by tax authorities could be materially different form the liabilities recorded.
        Molson sold the Montreal Canadiens professional hockey club (the "Club") to a purchaser in 2001. Molson maintained a 19.9% common ownership interest in the team, as well as a preferred interest, redeemable in 2009. The shareholders of the Club (the purchaser and Molson) and the National Hockey League (NHL) are parties to a consent agreement, which requires the purchaser and Molson to abide by funding requirements included in the terms of the shareholders' agreement. In addition, Molson has given certain guarantees to the lenders of the purchaser of the Canadiens and the Bell Centre (formerly the Molson Centre), such that in the event that the Canadiens and the purchaser are not able to meet their obligations, or in the event of a default, Molson shall 1) provide adequate support to the purchaser through necessary cash payments so that the purchaser would have sufficient funds to meet its debt obligations, and 2) exercise control of the entity which owns the Club and the entertainment business operated at the Bell Centre at predetermined conditions, subject to NHL approval. The obligations of the purchaser to such lenders were Cdn. $92.0 million at June 26, 2005. As
part of the sale transaction, Molson reaffirmed an existing guarantee of the purchaser's payment obligations on a 99-year lease arrangement (which began in 1993) related to the land upon which the Bell Centre has been constructed. Annual lease payments in 2004 were Cdn.$2.4 million, and are based on prevailing interest rates and changes in the consumer price index.
        We have made a preliminary estimate of the fair value of the guarantees to lenders as well as of a guarantee related to the land lease associated with the transaction. See Note 2.
Litigation and Other Disputes
        Beginning in May 2005, several purported class actions were filed in the United States and Canada, including federal courts in Delaware and Colorado and provincial courts in Canada alleging, among other things, that the Company and its affiliated entities, including Molson Inc., and certain officers and directors misled stockholders by failing to disclose first quarter (January-March) 2005 U.S. business trends prior to the merger vote in January 2005. The Company will vigorously defend the lawsuits.
        The Company has been contacted by the Central Regional Office of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Denver (the "SEC") requesting the voluntary provision of documents and other information from the Company and Molson Inc. relating primarily to corporate and financial information and communications related to the February merger, the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2005 and other information. The SEC has advised the Company that this inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred, nor should it be considered a reflection upon any person, entity, or security. The Company is cooperating with the inquiry.
        The Company has also been contacted by the New York Stock Exchange. The Exchange has requested information in connection with events leading up to the Company's earnings announcement on April 28, 2005. The Exchange regularly conducts reviews of market activity surrounding corporate announcements or events and has indicated that no inference of impropriety should be drawn from its inquiry. The Company is cooperating with this inquiry.
        On July 20, 2005, the Ontario Securities Commission requested information related to the trading of MCBC stock prior to April 28, 2005, which was the date we announced our first quarter 2005 losses attributed to lower sales and the Merger. We are cooperating with the inquiry.
        Molson Coors and many other brewers and distilled spirits manufacturers have been sued in several courts regarding advertising practices and underage consumption. The suits have all been brought by the same law firm and allege that each defendant intentionally marketed its products to "children and other underage consumers." In essence, each suit seeks, on behalf of an undefined class of parents and guardians, an injunction and unspecified money damages. We will vigorously defend this litigation and it is not possible at this time to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, in these lawsuits.
        CBL replaced a bonus plan in the United Kingdom with a different plan under which a bonus was not paid in 2003. A group of employees pursued a claim against CBL for this issue with an arbitration board. During the second quarter of 2005, the board ruled against CBL. CBL has appealed the arbitration award and is confident that it will be reversed. We have estimated the cost of the award, if affirmed, to be $1 million, and accrued that amount as of June 26, 2005. If the award were applied to other groups of employees, the potential loss could be higher.
        We are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, none of these disputes and legal actions is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters, including the above-described advertising practices case, may arise from time to time that may harm our business.
13.   DERIVATIVES
        Upon the Merger, we added various derivative instruments held by Molson and Brazil that hedged currency, commodity and interest rate risk in a similar manner as Coors. Certain Canadian interest rate swaps were unwound before the Merger occurred. Also, interest rate swaps held by BRI do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. All other Molson and Brazil derivative instruments since the Merger have been accounted for in accordance with US GAAP and Coors' derivative policies. Please refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Coors with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2004 for a description of Coors' derivative policies.
14.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
        On June 29, 2005, we entered into new employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors. The new agreements include salary and benefits terms, as well as termination benefits that effectively replace the change of control agreements in place at the time of the Merger. (See related Note 5).
15.   SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATION
        On May 7, 2002, a wholly-owned subsidiary, CBC (Issuer), completed a private placement of $850 million principal amount of 6/% Senior notes due 2012. The notes were issued with registration rights and are guaranteed on a senior and unsecured basis by MCBC (Parent Guarantor) and certain domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors). The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. A significant amount of the Issuer's income and cash flow is generated by its subsidiaries. As a result, funds necessary to meet the Issuer's debt service obligations are provided in large part by distributions or advances from its subsidiaries. Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, as well as our financial condition and operating requirements and those of certain domestic subsidiaries, could limit the Issuer's ability to obtain cash for the purpose of meeting its debt service obligation including the payment of principal and interest on the notes.

        Simultaneously with the private placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we registered the exchange of the notes for substantially identical notes. The exchange of all the notes was completed on September 16, 2002.
        The following information sets forth our Condensed Consolidating Balance Sheets as of June 26, 2005, and December 26, 2004, and the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Operations for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and June 27, 2004, and the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows for the twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005, and June 27, 2004. Investments in our subsidiaries are accounted for on the equity method; accordingly, entries necessary to consolidate the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, and all of its subsidiaries are reflected in the eliminations column. Separate complete financial statements of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors would not provide additional material information that would be useful in assessing their financial composition.
SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR INFORMATIONUPDATED FOR PROPOSED DEBT OFFERING
        The following tables present historical, supplemental guarantor financial information as if new debentures were issued by a finance subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company, (other than Coors Brewing Company, the Issuer of Existing Notes) with Molson Coors Brewing Company serving as a parent guarantor. The subsidiary presented as the Issuer of New Notes is Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC, a wholly-owned, Canadian entity created in connection with the Merger, which has short-term borrowings totaling $977.8 million as of June 26, 2005. In this scenario, Coors Brewing Company and Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC serve as guarantors of each others' notes. Subsidiary Guarantors, as presented below, are all other U.S. domestic subsidiaries of Molson Coors Brewing Company. The twenty-six weeks ended June 26, 2005 is the first period for which Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC had activity.

Exhibit 99.9
        GOLDEN, Colo., Sept. 6Coors Brewing Company and the National Football League have signed a new multi-year sponsorship agreement, following three successful seasons as partners. The highly sought-after "Official Beer Sponsor" designation for Coors will now extend through the 2010 season.
        "Coors has been an important part of the NFL family of sponsors since 2002 with its ongoing support of the NFL, its programs and teams," said Roger Goodell, the NFL's executive vice president and chief operating officer. "We are pleased to extend our partnership."
        With hundreds of millions of fans worldwide, NFL football has been the favorite sport of consumers since 1965, according to Harris Poll research. In fact, more than 120 million viewers tune in to watch NFL football each week.
        "The NFL is the single greatest sports property in the world and we are extremely pleased to remain associated with itparticularly in light of the intense competition for the beer category sponsorship," said Frits van Paasschen, president and CEO of Coors Brewing Company. "The NFL has been a terrific marketing partner for Coors and we look forward to creating exciting consumer programs that only the official beer of the NFL can offer," he said. In addition to general market programming, Coors will work with the NFL to create programs that engage the Hispanic consumer in the football experience.
        Coors Light is the third best-selling beer in the U.S. In 2005, Coors Light received top honors in the light beer category of the 2005 Brandweek Customer Loyalty Awards.
        Similar to the existing sponsorship agreement, Coors will continue to use NFL trademarks including the NFL Shield and the Super Bowl logo in advertising and promotions. In addition, under the new agreement, the brewer will also enjoy greater access to and involvement with local NFL teams, and will benefit from enhanced television rights on NFL Network and broadcast media.
        Coors and the NFL initially signed a four-year sponsorship agreement in early 2002.
