On August 2, 2006, W. Leo Kiely, III, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company"), Timothy V. Wolf, Global Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and Samuel D. Walker, Global Chief Legal Officer of the Company, each took action with respect to their existing written sales plans previously entered into pursuant to the guidance specified by Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Kiely entered into a new plan which will take effect in January 2007 after his existing plan expires. Mr. Wolf amended his existing plan, which would expire in December of 2006, to extend its term for an additional year, and Mr. Walker terminated his existing plan and entered into a new plan with a term expiring in one year. Each plan has been approved pursuant to the terms of the Company's policies. Each plan is part of the individual executive's long-term strategy to diversify assets and provides for the sale of shares of common stock of the Company in connection with exercises of vested stock options. Other Company executives may from time to time adopt 10b5-1 plans.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
