Molson Coors Reports 2007 First Quarter Results DENVER and MONTREAL, May 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; Toronto) today released its financial results for the fiscal first quarter ending April 1, 2007. The Company's sales volume increased 2.9 percent to 8.9 million barrels, or 10.4 million hectoliters (HLs), during the 13-week fiscal first quarter 2007 compared to the 13-week fiscal first quarter ended March 26, 2006. Net sales increased 6.5 percent to $1.23 billion in the first quarter 2007 versus a year ago. (All $ amounts in U.S. dollars.) Net income in the first quarter 2007 was $4.4 million. Income from continuing operations after tax in the first quarter 2007 was $19.2 million. Excluding special items(1), income from continuing operations(2) was $25.1 million, compared to an after-tax loss of $0.4 million in the first quarter 2006. Leo Kiely, Molson Coors president and chief executive officer, said, "Overall, our first quarter 2007 results are an encouraging start to the new year. We continued to strengthen our momentum from the second half of 2006 with our global focus on brand building and attacking costs. While cost and competitive pressures continued in the first quarter, our underlying business and financial performance continued to improve. We grew total company volume, revenue per barrel, margins and profits in the first quarter, while we invested aggressively behind strategic brands in all of our major businesses -- in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. In addition, we continued to make significant improvements to our cost structure through merger synergies and other cost reductions that helped to offset substantial cost inflation across all of our businesses. As a result, we achieved strong double-digit percentage growth in operating earnings. "Looking ahead, we are pleased with the momentum of our strategic brands as we prepare for this year's peak beer season. We believe our teams can build on that momentum and win the summer, while we make even more progress building great brands and reducing costs to fuel the investments we need to become a top-performing global brewer." 2007 First Quarter Results Key results for the Company's fiscal first quarter 2007, compared to the first quarter a year ago, include the following: * Net sales increased 6.5 percent to $1.23 billion. * Sales volume of 8.9 million barrels (10.4 million HLs) was up 2.9 percent. * Marketing, general and administrative expense rose 2.0 percent * Marketing, general and administrative expense rose 2.0 percent to $396.8 million. * Excluding special items, income from continuing operations (after tax) was $25.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $0.4 million, or $0.01 loss per diluted share, in the first quarter 2006. (See tables below for reconciliations to nearest U.S. GAAP measures.) During the quarter, Molson Coors achieved approximately $14 million in merger synergies. Foreign exchange rate movements reduced total-company pretax income by approximately $2.3 million in the quarter.
The Company's effective tax rate during the first quarter 2007 for income from continuing operations was 19 percent including special items and 21 percent excluding special items, compared to 33 percent and 31 percent, respectively, during the first quarter a year ago. The Company's first quarter 2007 tax rate was lower due to the net effect of a number of factors, including the completion of certain prior year audits, mix of pretax income and the impact of new accounting rules that were adopted at the beginning of 2007 for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax provisions. The Company anticipates that these new rules - -- known as FASB Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48 -- will cause greater volatility in the Company's effective tax rate in future quarters. Following are the Company's 2007 first quarter results by business segment: Canada Business Canada business pretax income was $45.3 million, excluding special charges, even with the first quarter 2006. Canada sales volume increased 2.8 percent, while sales to retail increased 1.2 percent. Strong growth in Coors Light, Rickard's, Carling and the Company's partner import brands was partially offset by a decline in other premium, discount and unsupported brands. Canada business net sales increased 4.1 percent in local currency. Net revenue per barrel increased about 1.3 percent in local currency compared to the first quarter 2006. Cost of goods sold per barrel increased 4.0 percent, while marketing, general and administrative costs increased approximately 1.8 percent, both in local currency. Synergies and other cost reduction initiatives offset nearly all of the Canada business cost of goods inflation. United States Business U.S. business pretax income was $45.2 million in the first quarter 2007. Excluding special charges a year ago, U.S. pretax income increased 23.1 percent, driven by sales volume growth, higher net pricing and results of the Company's merger synergies and other cost saving initiatives. In the first quarter 2007, sales volume and net sales in the U.S. business increased 4.9 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively, from the first quarter a year ago, while net sales per barrel increased 1.7 percent. Sales to retail grew 2.9 percent driven by a low-single-digit growth by Coors Light and double-digit increases by Keystone Light and Blue Moon. U.S. business cost of goods per barrel increased 0.3 percent and marketing, general and administrative expense was up 6.4 percent. Europe Business Excluding special items, the Europe business reported a pretax loss of $4.5 million in the first quarter 2007 compared to a $13.4 million pretax loss in the first quarter 2006. The smaller pretax loss compared to a year ago was driven by continued progress on cost saving initiatives in the Europe business, partly offset by ongoing industry volume pressures and unfavorable trends in sales channel mix. In the first quarter 2007, Europe business owned-brand sales volume decreased 1.7 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Owned-brand net sales per barrel increased 0.6 percent in local currency compared to the first quarter 2006. Cost of goods sold per barrel for the Company's owned brands decreased 2.8 percent in local currency during the quarter. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased 5.5 percent in local currency, with higher marketing spend in the first quarter more than offset by reductions in general and administrative costs. Corporate Expenses The Company's Corporate general and administrative expenses totaled $21.4 million in the first quarter 2007, a decrease of $8.3 million from the first quarter 2006. Net interest expense, excluding interest income from trade loans in the U.K., was $29.2 million in the first quarter 2007, $5.6 million lower than a year ago due primarily to lower average net debt balances during the quarter compared to the first quarter 2006. (1)Special Items During the first quarter 2007 the Company reported net special charges of $8.2 million, primarily due to restructuring expenses of $4.1 million in Canada and $4.2 million in Europe.
(2)Discontinued Operations The company reports results for its former Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser ("Kaiser") as discontinued operations. The Company reported a net loss of $14.8 million from discontinued operations during the quarter arising from an increase in the fair value of indemnity guarantees related to the Kaiser business. These liabilities increased during the first quarter 2007 due to changes in estimates related to the timing and amounts of estimated future outcomes and payments. 2007 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call Molson Coors Brewing Company will conduct an earnings conference call with financial analysts and investors at noon Eastern Time today to discuss the Company's 2007 first quarter results. The Company will provide a live webcast of the earnings call. Approximately two hours after the conclusion of the earnings call, the Company also will host an online, real-time webcast of an Investor Relations Follow-up Session with financial analysts at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

We believe that Pretax and After-tax Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations, Excluding Special Items is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to items such as special items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure. Our management uses Pretax and After-tax Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations, Excluding Special Items as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and language indicating trends, such as "trend improvements," "progress," "anticipated," "expected," "improving sales trends" and "on track." It also includes financial information, of which, as of the date of this press release, the Company's independent auditors have not completed their review. Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which the financial information and its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's projections and expectations are disclosed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include, among others, changes in consumer preferences and product trends; price discounting by major competitors; unanticipated expenses, margin impact and other factors resulting from the recent merger; failure to realize anticipated results from synergy initiatives; and increases in costs generally. All forward-looking statements in this press release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by reference to the underlying assumptions. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
