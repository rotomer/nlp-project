Item 2.06.    Material Impairments
 
On May 10, 2007, a trial court in Ontario, Canada ruled at the conclusion of a hearing that the termination notice issued by Foster's Group Limited in late October 2006 purporting to provide twelve months' notice of its intention to terminate the Foster's U.S. License Agreement due to the Merger was valid and effective. As previously disclosed, the Agreement provides Molson Canada with the right to produce Foster's beer for the U.S. marketplace. As a result of this ruling, Molson Coors Brewing Company will record a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2007 of all or a significant portion of our distribution right intangible associated with the Foster's intangible, which had a carrying value of approximately $24.6 million as of April 1, 2007. We are evaluating whether this situation will result in any additional impairment charges associated with fixed assets utilized in the production of Foster's. Although the Court's ruling will cause Molson Coors Brewing Company to record an impairment c harge, we do not expect a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
