Adoption of Change in Control Protection Plan
On May 17, 2007, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") adopted a Change in Control Protection Program (the "Plan").  The purpose of the Plan is to retain well-qualified executives and key personnel of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to provide severance benefits to such individuals if employment is terminated under qualifying circumstances in connection with a change in control of the Company.  A description of the material terms of the Plan follows below.  This description is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is filed as an exhibit hereto.
Eligible Participants
There are currently eleven executives of the Company and its subsidiaries who are eligible to participate in the Plan.  This group includes each of the Named Executive Officers identified in the Company's proxy statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, other than Messrs. Kiely and Coors.  The Plan permits the Board, or a designated committee thereof (the "Committee"), to designate from time to time and in its sole discretion, additional executives to participate in the Plan.  In order to participate in the Plan, an eligible executive must agree to certain confidentiality and non-competition obligations for one year following the date of termination.
Definition of Change in Control
As more fully described in the Plan filed as an exhibit hereto, a change in control under the plan occurs if:
the Molson and Coors families no longer have the ability to elect or cause to be elected through the current voting trust to which they are parties (the "Voting Trust"), or otherwise by agreement, directors representing at least 50% of a Controlling Block of Directors.  For purposes of the Plan, a Controlling Block means a number of directors comprising a majority of the Board which is elected pursuant to the Voting Trust or similar arrangement;
                 
Directors nominated by the Molson or Coors families do not make up at least 50% of a Controlling Block of Directors;
                 
Consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party or a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company unless following such transaction: (i) the Voting
                 
2
 
Trust continues to be able to elect a Controlling Block of Directors of the resulting entity; and (ii) at least 50% of the members of the Controlling Block of Directors are Molson/Coors nominees;
                       
Approval by the stockholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or
                 
Any other event including a merger or other transaction, which the Committee designates as a change in control with respect to any or all participants.
                 
Qualifying Termination of Employment
If a change in control occurs, a participant is eligible to receive severance benefits under the Plan if, within two years of the change in control, the participant either is terminated by the Company without "cause" as defined in the Plan, or resigns due to "constructive discharge" as defined in the Plan.  As more fully described in the Plan, "constructive discharge" includes:
Reduction by more than 10% of the participant's base salary and/or failure to provide opportunities to participate in short- and long-term incentive programs on a basis comparable to other executives at the same level;
                 
Failure by the Company to pay or provide earned compensation or benefits;
                 
Requirement that the participant relocate by more than 50 miles from the participant's primary office location at the time of the change in control; or
                 
Material reduction or adverse modification of the participant's duties, responsibilities, authority or position.
                 
Severance Benefits
The severance benefits payable under the Plan include:  (i) a pro rata bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination date occurs based on the greater of target bonus or year to date projection of full-year performance; (ii) a payment equal to a 1.5, 2.0 or 3.0 multiple of the participant's base salary plus bonus, with the multiple depending on the participant's level in the Company; (iii) outplacement services for a period of twelve months following the termination date; (iv) COBRA continuation of up to 18 months of medical/health insurance; (v) accelerated vesting of any equity awards; and (vi) modified excise tax gross-up.  The participant must execute a general release as a condition to receipt of severance benefits.

TAXES.
9.
            
.  The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any and all payments made to a Participant under the Program all federal, state, local and/or other taxes or imposts which the Company determines are required to be so withheld from such payments or by reason of any other payments made to or on behalf of the Participant or for his/her benefit hereunder.
(a)
          
Withholding Taxes
.  In the event any payments or benefits received or to be received by the Participant in connection with the Participant's employment (whether pursuant to the terms of the Program or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, or any person affiliated with the Company, and whether or not the Participant incurs a Qualifying Termination) (the "Payments"), are or will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed),
(b)
          
Excise Tax
then, subject to the immediately following paragraph (ii), the Company shall pay at the time specified below, an additional amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Participant, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Payments and any federal, state and local income or other applicable tax and Excise Tax upon the payment provided for by this paragraph, shall be equal to the Payments.
(i)
           
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing paragraph (i) to the contrary, the foregoing provision shall not apply (therefore no Gross-Up Payment will be made) and any Change in Control Severance Benefits otherwise payable to the Terminated Participant shall be reduced (but not below zero) such that no amounts paid or payable to the Terminated Participant as Change in Control Severance Benefits shall be deemed excess parachute payments subject to Excise Tax, in the event the amount of such reduction does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount of such Change in Control Severance Benefits deemed to be parachute payments.  Unless the Participant shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Change in Control Severance Benefits, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of such benefits which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination made by the independent public accountants selected under the preceding paragraph.  Any notice given by the Participant pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Participant's rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation.

marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-Up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the Participant's highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Participant's residence on the date on which the Excise Tax is determined, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.
The computations required by this Section 9(b) shall be made by independent public accountants not then regularly retained by the Company, in consultation with tax counsel selected by them and acceptable to the Committee.  The Company shall provide the Participant with sufficient tax and compensation data to enable the Participant or his/her tax advisor to verify such computations and shall reimburse the Participant for reasonable fees and expenses incurred with respect thereto.
(iv)
         
In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder, the Participant shall repay to the Company at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal and state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Participant) plus interest on the amount of such repayment from the date the Gross-Up Payment was initially made to the date of repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code (the "Applicable Rate").  In the event that the Excise Tax is determined by the Internal Revenue Service or by such independent public accountants to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties, fines or additions to tax payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess if finally determined.
(v)
          
Any payment to be made under this paragraph shall be payable within fifteen (15) days of the determination of the accountants that such a payment is required hereunder and, if applicable, within fifteen (15) days of such determination that the Excise Tax is greater or less than initially calculated but, in no event, later than thirty (30) days after the Participant's receipt of the Payments resulting in such Excise Tax.

Actions in Anticipation of a Change in Control
.  Change in Control Severance Benefits shall be reduced by any severance or similar payment or benefit made or provided by the Company or any Subsidiary to the Participant pursuant to (i) any severance plan, program, policy or similar arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company not otherwise referred to in the Program, (ii) any employment agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary and the Participant, and (iii) any federal, foreign, state or local statute, rule, regulation or ordinance.

.  Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any assets of the Company or any investments that the Company may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Program.  Nothing contained in the Program, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, Beneficiary, legal representative or any other person.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Program, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.  Subject to this Section 12(b), all payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts.

If the Committee determines that a Participant or a Beneficiary is unable to care for his/her affairs because of illness or accident or because he or she is a minor, any benefit due the Participant or Beneficiary may be paid to the Participant's spouse or to any other person deemed by the Committee to have incurred expense for such Participant (including a duly appointed guardian, committee or other legal representative), and any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the Company's obligation hereunder.
(i)
           
Incapacity
.  The Company shall have the unrestricted right to transfer its obligations under the Program with respect to one or more Participants to any person, including, but not limited to, any purchaser of all or any part of the Company's business.  No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to commute, encumber, transfer or otherwise dispose of or alienate any present or future right or expectancy which the Participant or Beneficiary may have at any time to receive payments of benefits hereunder, which benefits and the right thereto are expressly declared to be non-assignable and nontransferable, except to the extent required by law.  Any attempt to transfer or assign a benefit, or any rights granted hereunder, by a Participant or the spouse of a Participant shall, in the sole discretion of the Committee (after consideration of such facts as it deems pertinent), be grounds for terminating any rights of the Participant or Beneficiary to any portion of the Program benefits not previously paid.
(j)
           
Transferability of Rights
.  In the event any payment to a Participant under the Program is not paid within thirty (30) days after it is due and Participant notifies the Company and the Company fails to make such payment (to the extent such payment is undisputed), such payment shall thereafter bear interest at the prime rate from time to time as published in The Wall Street Journal, Midwest Edition.

In the event of any dispute between the Company and the Participant, whether arising out of or relating to the Program, or otherwise, the Participant and the Company hereby agree that such dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator who shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Company and the Participant, unless the parties are unable to agree to an arbitrator, in which case, the arbitrator will be selected under the procedures of the AAA.  The arbitrator shall be experienced in the resolution of disputes under employment agreements or plans or programs similar to the Program maintained by major corporations and shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction, and the parties hereby agree to the emergency procedures of the AAA.  However, either party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court having jurisdiction over such dispute or controversy and seek interim provisional, injunctive or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or

the controversy is otherwise resolved.  Except as necessary in court proceedings to enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of the Company and the Participant.  The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, or if applicable, the metropolitan area in which the Participant's primary office is located or was located immediately prior to such Participant's Date of Termination.  In the event of any such proceeding, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the Company and, unless the arbitrator determines that the Participant did not have a reasonable basis for his/her position with respect to the dispute in question, the Company shall also reimburse the Participant for his/her reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred with respect to such claim.  Otherwise, each party shall be responsible for its own expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant shall be required to exhaust his/her rights under Section 8 prior to proceeding with any arbitration hereunder.

.  It is intended that any amounts payable under this Program, and the Company's and Participant's exercise of authority or discretion hereunder, shall comply with Section 409A of the Code (including the Treasury regulations and other published guidance relating thereto) so as not to subject Participant to the payment of any interest or additional tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code.  In furtherance of this intent, if, due to the circumstances in existence at the time of the Participant's Qualifying Termination, the date of payment or the commencement of such payments or benefits in accordance with Section 6 must be delayed for six months in order to meet the requirements of Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code applicable to "specified employees," then any such payment or payments or benefits to which Participant would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of separation from service (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) shall be accumulated and paid as of the first day of the seventh month following the date of separation from service.

Re:  Change in Control Protection Program
Dear               :
As authorized by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company"), I am pleased to inform you that you have been selected to become a Participant in the Molson Coors Brewing Company Change in Control Protection Program (the "Program").  The Program is intended to provide benefits to Participants under certain circumstances if a Change in Control of the Company occurs and a Participant's employment is terminated within a certain period of time after such Change in Control.
Your Applicable Benefits Schedule (as defined in the Program) is Benefits Schedule  LO  , a copy of which is attached along with a copy of the Program document.
To become a Participant in the Program, you must sign one copy of this letter and [, unless you have previously entered into a similar agreement with the Company,] the enclosed Confidentiality and Noncompetition Agreement, and return them to me within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter.  If you elect to become a Participant, you and the Company will be subject to the terms of the Program and the Agreement.  In the event of any difference between this letter and the terms of the Program and Agreement, the terms of those documents will govern.
If you have questions about this letter, the Program please contact me.  Congratulations on becoming a Participant in the Program.
 
If you accept participation in the Program, please sign and date a copy of this letter and [, if applicable,] the enclosed agreement and return it as indicated above:
I have reviewed the Program, including the Confidentiality and Noncompete Agreement, (the "CNA"), and I understand that, as a condition of being a Program Participant, I must agree to the restrictions and agreements set forth in the Program and CNA [or have previously entered into an agreement similar to the CNA with the Company].  By signing and returning this copy of the letter and the Agent, I indicate my agreement to the terms of the Program and CNA [or reconfirm my obligations under the similar agreement I previously-executed].
