Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Underwriting Agreement
On June 11, 2007, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with the underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"), which are represented by Deutsche Bank Securities and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., to issue and sell $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% Convertible Senior Notes due July 30, 2013 (the "Convertible Notes") in a public offering.  The offering was conducted pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement") and a related prospectus (the "Prospectus") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes to cover over-allotments (the "over-allotment option").  The over-allotment option was exercised in full on June 13, 2007.  The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $565 million.
The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company.  Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities.  The description of the Underwriting Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In connection with the sale of the Notes, on June 11, 2007, the Company entered into privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with respect to the Company's Class B common stock (the "Purchased Call Options") with Deutsche Bank AG London, Citibank, N.A. and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (the "Counterparties") and amended those transactions on June 13, 2007 in connection with the exercise in full of the over-allotment option.  The Purchased Call Options cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the indenture to be entered into in connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, approximately 5,250,670 shares of the Company's Class B common stock at a strike price of approximately $109.51.  The Company paid approximately $106.7 million for the Purchased Call Options.  The Purchased Call Options will expire upon maturity of the Notes.
Separately and concurrently with entering into the Purchased Call Options, on June 11, 2007, and the exercise of the over-allotment option, on June 13, 2007, the Company also entered into and amended warrant transactions with the Counterparties with respect to the Company's Class B common stock, whereby the Company sold to the Counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 5,250,670 shares of the Company's Class B common stock (the "Sold Warrants") at a strike price of $140.176 per share.  The Sold Warrants will expire in ratable portions on a series of expiration dates commencing after the maturity of the Notes.  The Company received approximately $57.0 million from the sale of the Sold Warrants.  The Sold Warrants were issued to the Counterparties pursuant to the exception from registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
In connection with the Purchased Call Options and the Sold Warrants, on June 11, 2007 and June 13, 2007, the Company and the Counterparties entered into certain confirmation letters (collectively, the "Confirmations").
The Purchased Call Options are exercisable on the same dates as any date of conversion of the Notes.  The Purchased Call Options provide for net share settlement upon exercise, such that the Counterparties will owe the Company net shares of the Company's Class B common stock and/or cash in lieu thereof if elected by the Company under the Convertible Notes in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Company's Class B common stock over the strike price of the Purchased Call Options, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes and is similarly subject to certain customary adjustments.  The Sold Warrants provide for net share settlement upon exercise, such that the Company will owe the Counterparties net shares of its Class B common stock in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of its Class B common stock over the strike price of the Sold Warrants.
The Purchased Call Options and Sold Warrants are separate transactions, each entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Notes, and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes.  The Purchased Call Options are expected to reduce the potential dilution to the Company's Class B common stock upon any conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company's Class B common stock, as measured under the Purchased Call Options, at the
2
 
time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the Purchased Call Options.  If, however, the volume-weighted average price per share of the Company's Class B common stock exceeds the strike price of the Sold Warrants when the Sold Warrants are exercised, the Company will be required to issue shares of the Company's Class B common stock to the Counterparties, and those issuances will have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share.

(b)           Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company and the Guarantors, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company, any Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (iii) with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they were made; and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company, any such Guarantor or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that each Underwriter will be liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission has been made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectusthe Prospectus or such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 11 herein.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have.
,
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 7, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing.  No indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 7(c) if the party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on account of

the provisions of Section 7(a) or (b).  In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel at its own expense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the indemnified party in the event  (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel,  (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party within a reasonable period of time after notice of commencement of the action.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by you in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding.
(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the
21
one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)           The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7(e).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7(e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e),  (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter, and  (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(f)            In any proceeding relating to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus,the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may be sought under this Section 7 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees that any other contributing party may join it as an additional defendant in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.
(g)           Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 7 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred.  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 7 and the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantors set forth in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, the Company and the Guarantors, their respective directors or officers or any persons controlling the Company or the Guarantors, (ii) acceptance of any Securities and payment therefor hereunder, and
22
(iii) any termination of this Agreement.  A successor to any Underwriter, its directors or officers or any person controlling any Underwriter, or to the Company and the Guarantors, their respective directors or officers, or any person controlling the Company or the Guarantors, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 7.
.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by you to the Company and the Guarantors, if (a) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date (if different from the Closing Date and then only as to Optional Securities) (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Select Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company or Guarantors shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (iv) a material disruption in the securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses 8(a)(i) through 8(a)(iv), such events singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in your judgment, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

If on the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Underwriter or of the Company and the Guarantors.  In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration

Exhbit 99.1
 
DENVER, Colo., and MONTREAL, Quebec  Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) announced today that it intends to offer $500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013.  In connection with the offering, Molson Coors intends to grant the underwriters a 13-day option to purchase up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of additional notes solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
The notes will be senior, unsecured securities, benefiting from guarantees by certain Molson Coors subsidiaries.  They will be convertible, under specified circumstances, into shares of Molson Coors Class B common stock and will provide for "net share settlement" of any conversions (as described below).
The company intends to enter into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of up to three of the underwriters of the note offering to reduce the potential dilutive effect of future conversions of the notes.  The net share settlement procedure mentioned above will also further minimize potential dilution related to the convertible notes issue.  Pursuant to that procedure, upon conversion of the notes, the company (1) will pay the note holder an amount in cash equal to the lesser of the conversion obligation or the principal amount of the notes, and (2) will settle any excess of the conversion obligation above the notes' principal amount in Class B common stock or cash, at the company's election.  This will substantially reduce the number of shares of Class B common stock issued upon any conversion.
In addition, the company intends to sell warrants, exercisable for Class B common stock to the entities that are counterparties to the note hedge transactions.
The convertible note offering is being made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available for review on the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and at www.SEC.gov.  Copies of the preliminary prospectus for the offering can be obtained from the joint-book running managers for the offering, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Citi, at the following addresses or telephone numbers:

Molson Coors expects to use the majority of the net proceeds from the note offering and sale of the warrants, as well as other funding sources, to fund a tender offer by its Coors Brewing Company subsidiary for the purchase of up to $450 million of its
In addition, Molson Coors expects to use a portion of the proceeds from the offering to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge that it expects to enter into concurrently with the offering.  The company intends to use the remaining net proceeds of approximately $50 million for voluntary funding of pension obligations.
Molson Coors has been advised that, in connection with establishing a hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the counterparties to those transactions or their affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Molson Coors Class B common stock prior to or concurrently with the pricing of the notes.  The counterparties may also enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Molson Coors Class B common stock or purchase or sell Molson Coors Class B common stock in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes.  These activities could have the effect of increasing the price of the Class B common stock prior to, and possibly following, the pricing of the notes and may affect the trading price of the Class B common stock thereafter.

Exhibit 99.2
 
DENVER, Colo., and MONTREAL, Quebec  Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) announced today the pricing of its previously announced offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013.  The sale of the notes is expected to close on June 15, 2007.  In connection with the offering, Molson Coors has granted the underwriters a 13-day option to purchase up to $75 million aggregate principal amount of additional notes solely to cover over-allotments, if any.
The notes will be senior, unsecured securities, benefiting from guarantees by certain Molson Coors subsidiaries and will accrue interest at an annual rate of 2.5%.  They will be convertible, under specified circumstances, into shares of Molson Coors Class B common stock at an initial conversion price of $109.51 per share (equal to an initial conversion rate of approximately 9.1316 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes) and will provide for "net share settlement" of any conversions (as described below).
The company has entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the underwriters of the note offering to reduce the potential dilutive effect of future conversions of the notes.
