Item 2.06.  Material Impairments
Item 2.05.  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On July 31, 2007, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the Company) committed to a plan to close its brewery in Edmonton, Alberta, and to shift that facility's production to its other breweries in Canada.  The Edmonton facility brewed and packaged beer for the Company's Molson Canada business unit, and had been producing less than 10% of Molson Canada's annual production volume.  The transfer of operations to the other Canadian breweries is expected to take place during the fourth quarter of 2007 and be completed in the first quarter of 2008, during which the company expects to fully meet market demands from a supply perspective.
Approximately 136 employees will be impacted by the brewery's closure.  The brewery's unionized work force went on strike on May 30, 2007, and the brewery has not been operating since that date.  The closure of the brewery has been necessitated by changing industry dynamics in the Canada beer market and supports the Company's cost containment goals.
The Company expects to record in the third quarter of 2007 a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $37 million pretax associated with the carrying amount of tangible fixed assets at the Edmonton brewery, which will be considered held for sale.  In addition, the Company is evaluating termination benefits to employees directly impacted by the closure and intends to treat all affected employees fairly, with any additional costs and cash expenditures being incurred in the second half of 2007. At this time, the company cannot reasonably determine the cost of providing such benefits.
Other associated costs to be recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2007, including a possible loss on the partial settlement of a defined benefit pension plan and accelerated depreciation of certain other brewery assets, are estimated to be approximately $10-$12 million.  The company estimates a payback period of 4-5 years on the costs related to the closure.
Cash expenditures associated with the costs described above, excluding any potential termination benefits, are not expected to be significant.
