Item 2.05.  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On July 31, 2007, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the Company) filed a Form 8-K disclosing that the Company had committed to a plan to close its brewery in Edmonton, Alberta, and to shift that facility's production to its other breweries in Canada.  At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Company disclosed that it was evaluating termination benefits to employees directly impacted by the closure, however, the Company could not then reasonably determine the cost of providing such benefits.  On August 24, 2007, the Company determined to provide termination benefits to all impacted unionized and salaried employees.  The cost of providing such benefits will be approximately $9 million, which will be recognized and paid primarily in the third and fourth quarter of 2007.
