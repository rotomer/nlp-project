Leo Kiely, Molson Coors president and chief executive officer, said, We are very pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect continued strong momentum.  Across the board, our teams have remained focused on creating profitable growth by building brands and reducing costs.  Based on the strength of our brands, sales execution and cost-reduction initiatives, our U.S. and Canadian businesses once again delivered positive pricing and strong sales-to-retail and bottom-line growth.  In the U.K., where challenging conditions still dominate the brewing industry, our team grew overall market share and net pricing.
Mr. Kiely underlined: The disciplined focus on building our brands and reducing costs has enabled us to achieve our long-term profit target much earlier than expected.  Reaching this milestone in financial performance is a testament to the hard work and dedication of leaders throughout the company, who have consistently delivered results above expectations to the benefit of our shareholders.
During the quarter, Molson Coors achieved approximately $29 million in cost reductions as part of its three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth program.  Foreign exchange rate movements increased total-company pretax income by approximately $4 million in the quarter.  
The Companys effective tax rate during the first quarter 2008 for income from continuing operations was negative 12 percent including special items and positive 2 percent on an underlying basis, compared to positive 19 percent and 21 percent, respectively, during the first quarter a year ago.  The Companys first quarter 2008 tax rate was reduced by the release of unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter due to certain tax years closing or being effectively settled.  The Company now estimates that its full-year 2008 effective tax rate will be in the range of 14 percent to 18 percent on an underlying basis.
Business Segments
On March 5, 2008, Molson Coors Brewing Company announced the appointment of Dave Perkins as President, Global Brand and Market Development, with responsibility for growth and expansion of the Companys business and brand portfolios in global development markets.  As a result of this decision, the Companys current business in Asia, Continental Europe, Mexico and the Caribbean (not including Puerto Rico) are now included in Global Markets and Corporate.  In order to reflect this change, the former Europe segment has been re-named and now includes only the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.  The U.S. segment now represents only the United States and Puerto Rico.
Following are the Companys 2008 first quarter results by business segment:
 
 
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
Canada Business
The Canada business recorded a 41.5 percent increase in underlying pretax income to $64.1 million, driven by positive net pricing and a $9 million benefit from favorable foreign currency.
Canadian sales-to-retail increased 2.5 percent during the quarter.  The sales-to-retail increase was driven by strong growth by Molsons Strategic brands, including continued double-digit growth from Coors Light, Creemore and Carling during the quarter.  In addition, Molsons partner import brands achieved double-digit growth in the quarter and benefited from the addition of Modelo brands to the Molson portfolio in the western provinces following the startup of the Modelo Molson Import joint venture on January 1, 2008.  This joint venture was created to import, distribute and market the Modelo portfolio across all of Canada.  The Companys national market share increased by one-half share point compared to the previous year entirely due to the addition of the Modelo brands in western Canada.
The Modelo joint venture, which is recorded on an equity basis, replaces a distribution contract for the Modelo brands in eastern Canada.  With the exception of Molson Coors half of the new joint ventures equity income, Modelo brand results are now excluded from Canada results.  The change in the Modelo business arrangement, together with the 2007 termination of a U.S. production contract for Fosters, affects the comparability of results with the first quarter of 2007.
Canada sales volume decreased 8.6 percent in the quarter ending March 30, 2008, due entirely to the change in our Modelo arrangement and the termination of the Fosters contract.  Excluding these factors, comparable Canada sales volume increased slightly over the first quarter 2007.  Net sales per barrel increased 6.4 percent in local currency during the quarter driven by higher net pricing and by mix impacts from the volume factors described above.  Cost of goods sold per barrel increased 2.0 percent in local currency, driven by inflation increases that were nearly two-thirds offset by cost savings from the Resources for Growth initiative.  Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.1 percent in local currency during the quarter, driven by lower overhead from cost savings initiatives and amortization expense, along with the transfer of Modelo brand spending to the Modelo joint venture.
United States Business
Underlying U.S. pretax income increased 36.0 percent to $61.9 million, driven by strong sales volume growth, higher net pricing and continued savings from cost initiatives.  Total U.S. segment sales to retail grew 6.6 percent in the quarter, despite a decline in the challenged Puerto Rico market.  The increase was primarily due to mid-single-digit growth of Coors Light, and double-digit growth by Blue Moon, Keystone Light and Coors Banquet.  Each of the Companys four largest U.S. brands, representing more than 93% of its U.S. volume base, achieved accelerated sales and market-share gains in the quarter.  The strength of our U.S. portfolio spanned the country, resulting in significant market share gains and sales-to-retail growth in all major channels and in 47 out of 50 states -- and double-digit growth in 15 of these states.  Total sales volume to wholesalers grew 7.4 percent.  Net sales per barrel increased 3.4 percent in the first quarter, driven primarily by positive net pricing.
 
 
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
The U.S. business continued to benefit from disciplined cost performance.  Cost of goods sold per barrel in the U.S. business increased by only 1.6 percent.  This change was driven by higher transportation and packaging material costs, partially offset by operations cost savings initiatives.  Marketing, general and administrative expense increased 9.6 percent during the quarter, primarily due to accelerated amortization of long-term incentive expense.
United Kingdom Business
The U.K. business reported an underlying pretax loss of $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, a $0.7 million improvement versus the first quarter 2007.  The improvement was driven by increased off-premise volume and supply chain savings, offset in part by higher pension costs and lower on-premise volume.
U.K. owned brand volumes increased 1.0 percent in the first quarter, driven by a 17 percent increase in off-premise volume, leading to an increase in overall market share.  The increase in off-premise volume was partly driven by a combination of the Easter holiday falling in the first quarter this year and customers buying in advance of an increase in beer excise tax.  U.K. net revenue per barrel in local currency increased 4.0 percent during the quarter, driven equally by higher net pricing and by increased factored brand sales following the 2007 acquisition of Camerons.  The Company achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in owned-brand pricing in the U.K.
Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased 4.6 percent in the first quarter, due primarily to higher factored brand sales, pension expense and commodity inflation, offset in part by cost saving initiatives.  Marketing, general and administrative expense increased 3.5 percent in local currency.
Global Markets and Corporate
Marketing, general and administrative expenses for Global Markets and Corporate increased $7.8 million to $37.3 million in the first quarter 2008, including $28.9 million in Corporate general and administrative expenses.  The increase compared to a year ago was driven by accelerated long-term incentive plan expense.  Net interest expense was $26.7 million in the first quarter 2008, a decrease of $2.5 million compared to a year ago.  The pretax underlying loss for Global Markets and Corporate of $58.3 million, an increase of 13.0 percent, was due to accelerated long-term incentive plan expense in the first quarter of 2008.
 
Special and Other One-Time Items
During the first quarter 2008 the Company reported net special charges of $7.3million, primarily due to MillerCoors joint venture planning and employee retention costs, the cost to transition our shared services to a third-party supplier, U.K. supply chain restructuring charges,
 
and Edmonton brewery closure costs.  These expenses were largely offset by a gain on the sale of a company-owned U.S. distributorship.
 
 Molson Coors also recorded one-time debt extinguishment costs of $12.4 million to repurchase $180 million of the Companys 6-3/8% Senior Notes due 2012.
    
 
 
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
These special and other one-time items have been excluded from underlying earnings in the first quarter 2008.
Discontinued Operations
The Company reports results for its former Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser (Kaiser), as discontinued operations.  The Company reported a net loss of $9.0 million from discontinued operations during the quarter, arising from an increase in the fair value of indemnity guarantees related to the Kaiser business.  These liabilities increased during the first quarter 2008 due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements.

Pretax and After-Tax Underlying Earnings should be viewed as a supplement to  not a substitute for  our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  We believe that Underlying Earnings performance is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to items such as special items, which can vary substantiallyfrom company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure.  Our management uses Underlying Earnings as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.
