Item 1.01    Entry Into Material Definitive Agreement.
MillerCoors LLC Operating Agreement
        In connection with the closing of the joint venture transaction among Molson Coors Brewing Company ("
Molson Coors
"), Coors Brewing Company ("
Coors
"), SABMiller plc ("
SABMiller
") and Miller Brewing Company ("
Miller
"), each of Molson Coors, Coors, SABMiller and Miller have entered into an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement (the "
LLC Operating Agreement
"). The LLC Operating Agreement will be the primary operating document governing the joint venture, MillerCoors LLC ("
MillerCoors
").
        Pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement, MillerCoors will have a Board of Directors (the "
Board
") consisting of five Molson Coors-appointed directors and five Miller-appointed directors. The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board will be appointed alternatingly for three-year terms by each of Molson Coors or Miller, with the first Chairman of MillerCoors to be Peter H. Coors, the current Vice Chairman of Molson Coors, and the first Vice Chairman of MillerCoors to be Graham Mackay, the current Chief Executive Officer of SABMiller. The parties have agreed that Peter H. Coors will be reappointed as Chairman of MillerCoors to a second and a third term, for a total of 9 years in office. The Board will have standing Audit, Compensation and Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees, each comprised of an equal number of directors nominated by Molson Coors and by Miller.
        MillerCoors will be managed day-to-day by a Chief Executive Officer. Leo Kiely, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors prior to the consummation of the MillerCoors joint venture, has been appointed as the initial Chief Executive Officer of MillerCoors for a term of two years, subject to automatic renewal. SABMiller has appointed Tom Long, the current Chief Executive Officer of Miller Brewing Company, as the initial President and Chief Commercial Officer of MillerCoors. Mr. Long is expected to be the successor-CEO to Mr. Kiely. The LLC Operating Agreement contains an enumerated list of approval rights reserved solely for the Board, including approval of strategic, operating, integration and synergy plans; material changes to brands and brand rights; changes to the name or headquarters location of MillerCoors; appointment or removal of the CEO; certain mergers, acquisitions or dispositions; and material agreements related to intellectual property or trade secrets. SABMiller will have the right to shortlist the nominees for successor CEOs of MillerCoors.
        The LLC Operating Agreement prohibits Coors and Miller from transferring their interests in MillerCoors for five years, at which point either party may sell all (but not less than all) of its interests, subject to the other party's right of first refusal, or the parties may consider an initial public offering of MillerCoors equity. In the event of a change of control of Coors, Miller will have the right to convert its non-voting interests into voting interests and add one additional director, resulting in Miller obtaining governing control of MillerCoors. Coors would retain certain minority approval rights in most circumstances following a change of control of Coors. In the event of a change of control of Miller, (1) Coors will be entitled to acquire from Miller such number of non-voting interests held by Miller as would raise Coors' economic ownership to 50.0%, at a price which represents the fair market value of such non-voting interests at such time, (2) the right to shortlist the nominees for successor CEOs of MillerCoors will (upon exercise of the right to acquire such additional economic ownership) shift from Miller to Coors (and Coors will have the right to immediately replace the CEO) and (3) Coors will (upon exercise of the right to acquire such additional economic ownership) be entitled to name the Chairmen of the Audit, Compensation and Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committees.
        Pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement, the parties have agreed not to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing or sale of beer or beverages in the United States or Puerto Rico other than through MillerCoors and not to solicit each other's employees or MillerCoors' employees. Molson Coors and SABMiller have also agreed that neither will seek to acquire ownership or control
of the other until at least ten years after the execution of the LLC Operating Agreement. The parties may dissolve the MillerCoors joint venture by mutual agreement. In addition, either Miller or Coors may dissolve MillerCoors upon the other's bankruptcy, insolvency or criminal indictment.
        The foregoing description of the material terms of the LLC Operating Agreement is qualified by reference to the LLC Operating Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

To the extent such information is required by this item, it will be filed by amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K not later than 71 days after the date on which this Current Report on Form 8-K is required to be filed.
        (b)   Pro Forma Financial Information
        (1)   Beginning with our financial reporting for the quarter ended September 28, 2008, we will deconsolidate from our financial statements the contributed assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of our U.S. beer business, and reflect our 42% investment in MillerCoors using the equity method of accounting.

        The MillerCoors joint venture transaction represents both the disposition of 58% of our U.S. beer business and the acquisition of 42% of Miller Brewing Company's U.S. beer business and as the financial statements of the Miller Brewing Company's U.S. beer business being contributed are not yet available, we are currently unable to present a pro forma income statement depicting the joint venture formation at this time. Accordingly, we will file an Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A by the seventy-first day after the date on which this Report is required to be filed, which will include (1) complete Molson Coors Brewing Company pro forma financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2007 (and most recent interim periods), which will present our 42% interest in MillerCoors, including that portion of MillerCoors contributed by Miller Brewing Company and (2) audited financial statements of Miller Brewing Company as of, and for its fiscal year ended, March 31, 2008 (the most recent unaudited interim periods).
        (2)   The pro forma financial information required by this item for the acquired business is not being filed herewith.

3.     CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND SHARES.
3.1.  Shareholders
        The name, address, and number of Shares of each class of Shares of each Initial Shareholder are listed on the Capital Account Schedule. The Capital Account Schedule shall be amended from time to time and any reference in this Agreement to the Capital Account Schedule is deemed to be a reference to the Capital Account Schedule as amended and in effect from time to time. Each person listed on the Capital Account Schedule:
(i)
with respect to the initial issuances of Shares upon the formation of the Company, was admitted as a Shareholder of the Company with respect to the Shares so issued upon such person's execution of the Interim Operating Agreement and receipt by the Company of such person's Capital Contribution on the date thereof as set out in the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule and the Final Capital Account Schedule; and
(ii)
with respect to the issuances of Shares on the date hereof, is hereby admitted as a Shareholder of the Company with respect to the Shares so issued on the date hereof upon such person's execution of this Agreement and receipt by the Company of such person's Capital Contribution on the date hereof as set out in the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule and the Final Capital Account Schedule.
        Each Shareholder's interest in the Company, including such Shareholder's interest in Profits, Losses and distributions of the Company and the right to vote, if applicable, on certain matters as provided in this Agreement, shall be represented by the Shares owned by such Shareholder. The ownership of Shares shall entitle each Shareholder to allocations of Profits, Losses and distributions as set out in Sections 16 and 17 of this Agreement.
3.2.  Limitation of Liability; No Personal Liability of Shareholders
(a)
Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of the Delaware Act that, pursuant to the Delaware Act, cannot be altered by agreement of the Parties, each Shareholder's liability to provide capital or other assets to the Company shall be limited to such Shareholder's agreed investment in the Company, including any additional Capital Contributions such Shareholder is committed to make under this Agreement to the extent such investment or contribution has not yet been made, and in the case of additional Capital Contributions, such obligation shall be solely to provide such contributions for the purposes such Shareholder has committed to make such additional Capital Contributions, and, except as otherwise provided by the provisions of the Delaware Act that, pursuant to the Delaware Act, cannot be altered by agreement of the Parties, no Shareholder shall have any further obligation to make any other contributions of capital or provide other property to the Company.
(b)
Except as otherwise provided by the Delaware Act:
(i)
the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, and no Shareholder shall be obligated personally for any such debt, obligation or liability of the Company solely by reason of being a Shareholder of the Company; and
(ii)
no Shareholder shall be liable for any obligation of the Company unless such liability is expressly assumed by such Shareholder in a separate written agreement signed by such Shareholder.
(c)
In accordance with the Delaware Act and the Laws of the State of Delaware, a Shareholder may, under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts previously distributed to such Shareholder. It is the intent of the Shareholders that no distribution to any Shareholder pursuant to Section 16 shall be deemed a return of money or other property paid or distributed in violation of the Delaware Act. The payment of any such money or distribution of any such property to a Shareholder shall be deemed to be a compromise within the meaning of Section 18-502(b) of the Delaware Act, and the Shareholder receiving any such money or property shall not be required to return to any person any such money or property. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Shareholder is obligated to make any such payment; such obligation shall be the obligation of such Shareholder and not of any other Shareholder.
3.3.  Capital Accounts
        A separate Capital Account will be maintained for each Shareholder in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Each Shareholder's initial Capital Account balance on the date of this Agreement shall be determined pursuant to Section 3.4. Thereafter, the Capital Account of each Shareholder will be adjusted as follows:
(a)
Each Shareholder's Capital Account shall be increased by the amount of cash and the Gross Asset Value of other property contributed, the amount of Profits allocated to such Shareholder (and any items of income or gain specially allocated to such Shareholder) pursuant to Sections 17.1 and 17.2 and the amount of any Company liabilities that are assumed by such Shareholder or that are secured by a Company asset distributed to such Shareholder.
(b)
Each Shareholder's Capital Account shall be decreased by the amount of cash and the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset distributed to such Shareholder pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, the amount of Losses allocated to such Shareholder (and any items of loss or deduction specially allocated to such Shareholder) pursuant to Sections 17.1 and 17.2 and the amount of any liabilities of such Shareholder that are assumed by the Company or that are secured by any asset contributed by such Shareholder to the Company.
(c)
In the event any Shares are transferred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account of the transferor to the extent it relates to the portion of the Shares so Transferred.
        The provisions of this Section 3.3 relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts have been included in this Agreement to comply with Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and will be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with those provisions. If the Board shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Treasury Regulations, the Board may make such modifications,
provided
,
however
, that no such change shall have
an adverse effect upon the amount distributable to any Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement or the timing of such distribution.
3.4.  Determination of Capital Accounts
(a)
The Company shall prepare and deliver to each Party the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule no later than one month after the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall determine and reflect on the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule (i) the estimated Asset Fair Market Value and Tax basis as of the date of this Agreement of each asset (or class of assets) comprising part of the initial Capital Contributions; and (ii) the estimated amount as of the date of this Agreement of any liability (or class of liability) assumed by the Company as part of the initial Capital Contributions (including, with particularity, the amount and class of any Section 1.752-7 Liability). The Parties shall also reflect on the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule an agreed-upon methodology by which the amounts set forth thereon shall be updated to reflect the actual amounts thereof as of the date of contribution pursuant to the JV Agreement, such methodology to be consistent with the methodology used for determining the amounts as of January 3, 2008.
(b)
(i)
On or within sixty (60) days after the Final Valuation Date, except to the extent provided in Section 3.4(b)(i)(2), the Company shall prepare and deliver to each Party a Final Capital Account Schedule, prepared as set forth in Section 3.4(a) above, which will reflect each Shareholder's initial Capital Account as of the date of this Agreement, provided that a Shareholder's initial Capital Account shall be determined taking into account any Adjustment Amounts to a Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.10 of the JV Agreement as set forth below:
(1)
If, as of the Final Valuation Date, the Adjustment Amounts have been paid in accordance with Section 2.10 of the JV Agreement, or if those amounts have not been paid, but the Closing CBC Retiree Amount and Closing Miller Retiree Amount, respectively, and the corresponding Adjustment Amounts, have been agreed upon by the Shareholders and are not subject to a dispute pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(iii) or Section 2.10(c)(iii) of the JV Agreement, the initial Capital Account of a Shareholder shall be determined within sixty (60) days after the Final Valuation Date, taking into account the Adjustment Amounts so paid or agreed.
(2)
If, on the Final Valuation Date, there is a dispute regarding the Closing CBC Retiree Amount or Closing Miller Retiree Amount, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(iii) or 2.10(c)(iii) of the JV Agreement, or if the Shareholders have not yet agreed on the Closing CBC Retiree Amount or the Closing Miller Retiree Amount, the initial Capital Account of a Shareholder shall be determined as soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the CBC Retiree Liabilities or Miller Retiree Liabilities and the corresponding Adjustment Amounts are finally determined or agreed upon.
(ii)
For the avoidance of doubt, on the Final Capital Account Schedule, Miller's initial Capital Account will represent fifty-eight percent (58%) and CBC's initial Capital Account will represent forty-two percent (42%), respectively, of the aggregate initial Capital Accounts, taking into account the payment of any Adjustment Amounts in accordance with Section 3.4 (b)(i).
(c)
From the date of this Agreement and until the delivery of the Final Capital Account Schedule, all allocations of Profits and Losses, including Regulatory Allocations and Tax
Allocations, as the case may be, shall be determined and made based on the Capital Accounts of the Shareholders as set forth on the Preliminary Capital Account Schedule. These allocations shall be re-determined and adjusted, as appropriate, upon delivery of the Final Capital Account Schedule as if the initial Capital Accounts as set forth on the Final Capital Account Schedule would have been available on the date of this Agreement.
(d)
The Final Capital Account Schedule, as revised from time to time, shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and the Parties agree to be bound by the Final Capital Account Schedule as if it were included in this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine the Capital Account balance of any Shareholder, the Capital Account balance of such Shareholder shall be determined after giving effect to all allocations pursuant to Section 17 and all contributions and distributions made prior to the time as of which such determination is to be made.
3.5.  Negative Capital Accounts
        No Shareholder shall be required to pay to any other Shareholder or the Company any deficit or negative balance that may exist from time to time in such Shareholder's Capital Account (including upon and after dissolution of the Company).

        No person shall be entitled to withdraw any part of such person's Capital Contributions or Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Company, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

Every certificate surrendered for registration of Transfer shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of Transfer in form satisfactory to the Board, duly executed by the registered holder thereof or such holder's authorized attorney-in-fact.
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a transfer of Shares in the Company requires delivery of an endorsed certificate representing such Shares and shall be effective only upon registration of such transfer in the books of the Company.
3.9.  New Certificates
        The Company shall issue a new certificate in place of any certificate previously issued if the record holder of the certificate:
(a)
makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the Board, that a previously issued certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen;
(b)
if requested by the Board, delivers to the Company a bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the Board, with such surety or sureties and with fixed or open liability as the Board may direct, to indemnify the Company, as registrar, against any claim that may be made on account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the certificate; and

5.     MANAGEMENT: RIGHTS, POWERS AND DUTIES.
5.1.  Generally
        Except as provided in this Agreement and except for situations in which the approval of any Shareholder is expressly required by this Agreement or non-waivable provisions of applicable Law:
(a)
all of the powers of the Company shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under the direction of, the Board of Directors; and

the Board of Directors may make all decisions and take all actions for the Company not otherwise provided for in this Agreement.
        The Board of Directors shall be the manager of the Company within the meaning of Section 18-101(10) of the Delaware Act. The Board of Directors must act as a board in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and no individual Director, as such, shall have any authority to bind or act for, or assume any obligation or responsibility on behalf of, the Company unless expressly authorized to do so by action taken by the Board of Directors in accordance with this Agreement. No individual Director will be deemed to be a manager of the Company within the meaning of Section 18-101(10) of the Delaware Act. The board of managers provided for in the Interim Operating Agreement is hereby dissolved and each manager appointed pursuant to the Interim Operating Agreement is hereby removed from his position as a manager of the Company (which removal shall not affect such Person's appointment as a Director hereby).
5.2.  Shareholders
        The Shareholders shall have no power to participate in the management or affairs of the Company other than the right to appoint Directors and as otherwise expressly set forth herein. The Shareholders shall not have meetings or voting rights with respect to the management of the Company and shall not be entitled to vote on or consent to or approve or disapprove actions or decisions regarding the Company except as expressly provided herein. Shareholders shall act at a meeting duly called or by written consent with respect to any action required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders.

five Miller Directors.
5.4.  Appointment to Board

The CBC Directors and the Miller Directors as of the date of this Agreement are set forth in Schedule 3.

Each Director shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and qualified, or until the earlier of his death, incapacity, resignation or removal (with or without cause) as provided in this Agreement.
(c)
Any Director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, only by the Shareholder that appointed such Director by written notice to the Board of Directors and the other Shareholders. Any Director may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors and the Shareholders. Such resignation shall take effect at the time specified in the written notice or, if no time is specified in the notice, at the time of its receipt by the Shareholders;
provided
,
however
, that the acceptance of a resignation will not be necessary to make it effective, unless so specified in the resignation. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors may only be filled by the Shareholder that originally appointed the Director who is no longer serving in such capacity. The applicable Shareholder shall promptly appoint a replacement for any such Director who has resigned, been removed or otherwise ceased to be a Director, by a written notice delivered to the other Shareholders and the Board of Directors and shall be effective upon delivery to the other Shareholders.
(d)
Without limiting the rights of either Miller or CBC to appoint such individual as either of them thinks fit, each will take into account the representations of the other if the other reasonably requests, for material commercial, fiscal or legal reasons, that it withdraw any proposed appointee as a Director and propose another suitable person for appointment.
(e)
Any Director (other than an alternate director) may grant a proxy to any other Person (who may be another Director) to be his or her alternate director and may remove from office an alternate director so appointed by him or her.

provided
,
however
, that if two successive meetings of the Board are not able to be held as a result of a failure of sufficient CBC Directors or Miller Directors, as the case may be, to attend either such meeting, the

The process set out in Section 7.2(e) shall continue and shall not need to be re-started in the event that one or more candidates declines to be considered for appointment or is removed from consideration for appointment by the Board, Miller or CBC, provided that if there are no candidates left for consideration the Board may either resolve to restart the process in Section 7.2(e) or substitute an alternative process to select the CEO for that CEO appointment only. If the Board is unable to agree an alternative process, it shall be deemed to have resolved to restart the process in Section 7.2(e).

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to make such advances of expenses (or expenses under Section 10.2) to an Indemnified Person in connection with any action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) by such Indemnified Person was authorized by the Board in its sole discretion (other than suits for recovery under this Section 10.4).

12.1.  If the Board does not agree on any Reserved Matter (other than (i) Section 9.1(c), which shall be resolved pursuant to Section 12.8, (ii) appointment of the CEO pursuant to Section 9.1(g), which shall be resolved in accordance with Section 7.2(e), or (iii) whether a Director has unreasonably withheld or delayed approval of the compensation of the CEO pursuant to Section 9.1(g), which shall be resolved in accordance with Section 29), within twenty (20) Business Days of the Board meeting at which the Board considers the matter, the matter may be referred for a decision to the SABMiller CEO and Molson Coors CEO.

12.7.  If the SABMiller CEO and the Molson Coors CEO do not accept the Neutral Adviser's recommendation and do not otherwise reach agreement on resolution of the matter, then the matter shall be deemed not approved by the Board.
12.8.  In the event of a deadlock on the Reserved Matter in Section 9.1(c), the matter shall be referred by either Shareholder, with notice in writing to the other Shareholder, to an independent expert for a decision in accordance with the following procedure:
(a)
The independent expert shall be a retired business person with significant experience in the United States beverage industry (the "

"). If the Shareholders are unable to agree on a Beverage Expert within ten (10) Business Days of the written notice to refer the matter to a Beverage Expert or if the Beverage Expert agreed upon is unable or unwilling to act thereafter, any Shareholder may, within ten (10) Business Days of notice to the Shareholders stating that they are unable to agree on a Beverage Expert or that the Beverage Expert agreed upon is unable or unwilling to act, request that the National Beer Wholesalers Association appoint a Beverage Expert.

In the event of a failure to agree on the Annual Operating Plan in any year, the previous year's Annual Operating Plan shall apply, with each of the figures in the Annual Operating Plan increased by an amount equal to the relevant figure multiplied by the Inflation Rate for the period from the month preceding the commencement of the prior year to the month preceding the commencement of the current year, until the date on which the Board has approved a revised Annual Operating Plan in accordance with Section 9.1(b).
13.   FUNDING.
13.1.  The Parties agree that, subject to such governmental regulations and consents as may for the time being be applicable, the financing policy of the MillerCoors Group shall be in accordance with the applicable Company Policy (as amended from time to time).
13.2.  Any determination that the MillerCoors Group requires funding in excess of its own resources shall be a matter for the Board. If the Board determines that such funding is required it shall also determine the form in which it considers such funding should be provided.
13.3.  Unless the Board determines otherwise, any funding by the Shareholders shall be provided by the Shareholders in proportion to their respective holdings of Shares from time to time (each such person being referred to for the purposes of this Section 13 as a "
Funding Shareholder
"). In determining the Shareholder's respective holding of Shares under this Section 13 and Section 14, Class A Shares shall be treated as identical to Class B Shares.
13.4.  Subject to Section 25.5, if funding is provided by way of loans by the Funding Shareholders, such loans shall rank pari passu in all respects as to repayment, rate of interest and otherwise and shall in addition be made on terms that no repayment to one Funding Shareholder shall be made by the MillerCoors Group unless at the same time a proportionate repayment shall be made to any other Funding Shareholder. If at any time the proportions in which Shares are held by the Shareholders shall alter, such adjustments shall be made either by way of repayment of loans by the MillerCoors Group or the purchase by one Shareholder of the right of the other Shareholder to repayment of the loans as shall be necessary to ensure that the loans to the MillerCoors Group from the Shareholders remain in the same proportion to each other as their respective holdings of Shares from time to time.
13.5.  If the Board determines that funding should be provided by the Shareholders in the form of subscriptions for further Shares ("
Equity Funding
"), the Shareholders shall take all reasonable steps required to implement such Equity Funding including causing their respective Directors to pass resolutions to increase the authorized capital of the Company and to authorize the Directors to allot and issue Shares. Any Equity Funding will be pro-rata based on the number of Shares that each Shareholder owns. The Shareholders will each subscribe for an equal number of Class A Shares with any additional Shares to be subscribed for by a Shareholder to be Class B Shares.
13.6.  If any Shareholder decides not to provide additional funding to the Company, it must notify all the other Parties in writing immediately (a "
Non-Funding Notice
").
14.   FAILURE TO FUND.
14.1.  The provisions of this Section 14 shall apply if, following:
(a)
a decision by the Board ("
Funding Decision
") that the Company should acquire funding from the Shareholders in proportion to their holdings of Shares in the Company; or
(b)
the Shareholders becoming obligated to provide funding pursuant to Section 21.6 (in either case the "
Original Funding
"),
either Shareholder (the "
Non-Funding Party
") fails to provide such funding to the Company or has given a Non-Funding Notice pursuant to Section 13.6.
14.2.  The other Shareholder (the "
Funding Party
") may, at its absolute discretion, elect to provide the share of the Original Funding which was not provided by the Non-Funding Party (the "
Replacement Funding
") in accordance with the provisions of this Section 14.
14.3.  In the event of a Funding Decision involving the issuance of additional Shares, the subscription price per Share under this Section 14 shall be Fair Market Value determined by agreement between the Shareholders. If the Shareholders cannot reach agreement as to the Fair Market Value within twenty (20) Business Days of the earlier of the dates of the Non-Funding Notice or the failure of the Non-Funding Party to provide funding to the Company, the Shareholders will appoint an Independent Investment Bank to determine the Fair Market Value of the Shares, the costs of which are to be borne by the Company. The Fair Market Values determined by this Section 14.3 are the "
Funding Fair Market Value
".
14.4.  If the amount of Replacement Funding is such that, if the Funding Party were to provide it by way of a subscription for additional Class A Shares at the Funding Fair Market Value the voting interest of the Funding Party in the Company would increase by less than two percentage points (after taking account of the number of Class A Shares which would have been subscribed for by the Funding Party if each of the Shareholders had provided its share of the Original Funding), then:
(a)
the Funding Party will provide its share of the Original Funding (the "
Required Funding
") by way of subscription for Class B Shares (the "
Required Funding Shares
") and will provide the Replacement Funding by way of subscription for additional Class B Shares (the "
Replacement Funding Shares
"), in each case at the Funding Fair Market Value;
(b)
the Non-Funding Party shall be entitled, within one year following the provision of Replacement Funding by the Funding Party, to remedy its failure to fund by purchasing the Replacement Funding Shares from the Funding Party for cash at their subscription value plus interest from the date of provision of the Replacement Funding to the date of purchase at an annual rate equal to the weighted average of SABMiller's and Molson Coors's cost of borrowing plus 200 basis points;
(c)
if the Non-Funding Party purchases the Replacement Funding Shares within the period specified in (b) above, then the Required Funding Shares and the Replacement Funding Shares shall convert into such numbers of Class A Shares and Class B Shares (as the case may be) as the Shareholders would have subscribed for if each of the Shareholders had provided its share of the Original Funding in accordance with the Funding Decision; and
(d)
if the Non-Funding Party does not purchase the Replacement Funding Shares within the period specified in clause (b) above, then:
(i)
the Required Funding Shares and the Replacement Funding Shares shall convert into Class A Shares, and the provisions of Section 14.6 will have effect; and
(ii)
the Funding Party will be entitled to a payment from the Company equal to the one year of interest that the Non-Funding Party would have paid if it had purchased the Replacement Funding Shares at the end of the period specified in clause (b) above.
14.5.  If the amount of the Replacement Funding is such that, if the Funding Party were to provide it by way of a subscription for additional Class A Shares at the Funding Fair Market Value the voting
interest of the Funding Party in the Company would increase by two or more percentage points (after taking account of the number of Class A Shares which would have been subscribed for by the Funding Party if each of the Shareholders had provided its share of the Original Funding), the Funding Party will provide the Required Funding and the Replacement Funding by way of subscription for additional Class A Shares at the Funding Fair Market Value, and the provisions of Section 14.6 will have effect.
14.6.  If Section 14.4(d) or Section 14.5 applies, then:
(a)
if the Funding Party is Miller, the provisions of Sections 19.1(a) and (b) shall apply provided that CBC holds at least fifteen percent (15%) of the number of Class A Shares then issued and outstanding. If at any time, CBC holds less than fifteen percent (15%) of the number of Class A Shares then issued and outstanding, the provisions of Sections 19.1(a) and (b) (but excluding Section 19.1(b)(i)(1)) shall apply; or
(b)
if the Funding Party is CBC:
(i)
such number of Miller's Class B Shares shall automatically be converted into Class A Shares as is required in order that the voting interests in the Company continue to be held in equal proportions by Miller and CBC;
(ii)
if, after conversion of all of Miller's Class B Shares into Class A Shares, Miller's voting interest in the Company is less than fifty percent (50%), then the number of Directors shall be increased by one and CBC shall be entitled to appoint one additional Director;
(iii)
if CBC exercises that right then the provisions of Section 19.1(b) shall apply but with all references to CBC replaced by references to Miller and vice versa provided that Miller holds at least fifteen percent (15%) of the number of Class A Shares then issued and outstanding. If at any time, Miller holds less than fifteen percent (15%) of the number of Class A Shares then issued and outstanding, the provisions of Section 19.1(b) (but excluding Section 19.1(b)(i)(1)) shall apply but with all references to CBC replaced with references to Miller and vice versa.
14.7.  The Shareholders shall take all steps required to implement the subscription of additional Shares or the conversion of Shares pursuant to this Section 14, including causing their respective Directors to pass resolutions to increase the authorized capital of the Company and to authorize the Directors to allot and issue Shares.
14.8.  A Non-Funding Party shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement by reason solely of its determination not to fund or its failure to fund.
15.   RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS.
15.1.  At the first meeting of the Board following the execution of this Agreement, the Directors shall cause the Company to enter into the following agreements as at the date of this Agreement:
(a)
the Services Agreements;
(b)
the Contract Brewing Agreements; and
(c)
the Brand Cooperation Agreement, and the agreements contemplated therein.
15.2.  Any Shareholder may request the CEO to cause, and if the CEO agrees it is in the best interests of the Company, the CEO shall cause, the Company to take appropriate steps to enforce the Brand Cooperation Agreement and any agreement entered into pursuant to it, any Services Agreement, the Contract Brewing Agreements and any other agreement entered into between the Company and a member of the Wider SABMiller Group or a member of the Wider Molson Coors Group.
16.   DISTRIBUTIONS.
16.1.  Monthly Distributions
(a)
Subject to the provisions of Section 16.1(b) and Section 16.2, the Company shall, without requirement of any further action by the Board, distribute to the Shareholders pro rata, in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, all Available Cash accumulated or otherwise available in each calendar month in one or more distributions during such month or within ten (10) days after the end of such month (such distributions, "
Monthly Distributions
"). To the extent that there are sufficient profits of the Company in the relevant Tax Year, Monthly Distributions shall be paid out of the profits of the Tax Year in which the month prior to which they were made ended. If there are insufficient profits in the relevant Tax Year, Monthly Distributions shall be paid out of undistributed profits (if any) of earlier Tax Years (taking more recent Tax Years first).
(b)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any distribution to any Shareholder on account of its interest in the Company if such distribution would violate Section 18-607 of the Delaware Act or other applicable Law,
provided
,
however
that the Company shall instead make such distribution as soon as practicable after such time as making such distribution would not be prohibited by Law, and provided, further, that the Company shall not make any distribution to the extent that, after giving effect to such distribution, the net worth of the Company (i.e., the amount by which the Asset Fair Market Value of the assets of the Company exceeds the liabilities of the Company) would be less than the nominal value of the Shares issued by the Company which shall constitute a separate nondistributable reserve.
(c)
For the avoidance of doubt, any distributions by the Company to a Shareholder pursuant to the JV Agreement are in addition to the Monthly Distributions set forth in Section 16.1(a), and shall not be subject to the provisions of Sections 16.1(a) and 16.1(b).
16.2.  Tax Distributions
(a)
Notwithstanding Section 16.1(a) above, in the event the Company disposes of a Material Asset contributed by a Shareholder, and as a result of such disposition a Shareholder is allocated a greater share of taxable gain or income in respect of such asset than such Shareholder's Percentage Interest in the Company, then the Company shall distribute to such Shareholder, in addition to any amounts distributed under Section 16.1(a), an amount equal to such Shareholder's Tax liability in respect of such excess share of taxable gain or income (assuming
taxation at the maximum combined U.S. federal, state, and local tax rate of forty percent (40%)) (a "
Tax Distribution
"). A Tax Distribution shall be made as soon as possible following receipt of the proceeds of disposition of the Material Asset by the Company and in any event no later than the due date for the Shareholder's Tax Return (or relevant estimated Tax payment) in the taxable year of such disposition.
(b)
The aggregate amount of Tax Distributions pursuant to Section 16.2(a) (with respect to each disposition of a Material Asset) shall be limited to the amount of Available Cash at the time of the Tax Distribution and, in the event that the amount of Available Cash is less than the aggregate amount to be distributed in accordance with Section 16.2(a), the amount of Available Cash shall be distributed to the Shareholders entitled to a such Tax Distribution in proportion to the relative amount that would have been distributable to each such Shareholder in accordance with Section 16.2(a) had there been sufficient Available Cash, provided that any shortfall shall be distributed as soon as possible out of future Available Cash and in priority to other distributions of Available Cash pursuant to Section 16.1(a).
16.3.  Withholding
        With respect to any withholding Tax or other similar Tax liability or obligation to which the Company may be subject as a result of any act or status of any Shareholder or to which the Company becomes subject with respect to any Share, the Company shall cause such amounts to be withheld and to be paid as so required to the appropriate Tax authorities. All amounts withheld on behalf of a Shareholder, plus interest thereon at a rate equal to the Applicable Rate, shall, at the option of the Board, (i) be promptly paid to the Company by the Shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld (such payment not to constitute a Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement), or (ii) be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been paid to such Shareholder (including a Tax Distribution) or, if such distributions are not sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing the proceeds of liquidation otherwise payable to such Shareholder pursuant to Section 35.3. Whenever the Board selects option (ii) pursuant to the preceding sentence for repayment of any amounts withheld on behalf of such Shareholder, for all other purposes of this Agreement such Shareholder shall be treated as having received all distributions (whether before or upon liquidation) unreduced by the amount of such Tax amounts withheld and interest thereon. Each Shareholder hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable state and federal law, to reimburse the Company for any liability with respect to any amounts withheld in respect of Taxes on behalf of or with respect to such Shareholder.
17.   ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES.
17.1.  Allocations of Profits and Losses
        After the application of Sections 17.2 and 17.3 and subject to Sections 17.4(c) and 17.4(e) and so long as no event of dissolution has occurred pursuant to Section 35.2, the Company's Profits and Losses for each Tax Year, or portion thereof, shall be allocated to the Shareholders pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests,
provided
,
however
, that, beginning with the Tax Year in which a dissolution of the Company occurs, Profits (including any Profits arising from adjustments to the Gross Asset Value of the Company's assets) and, if necessary, items of gross income or gain, and Losses (including Losses arising from adjustments to the Gross Asset Value of the Company's assets) and, if necessary, items of deduction or loss, shall be allocated among the Shareholders in such a manner that, after such allocations, the Capital Accounts of all Shareholders are, to the greatest extent possible, equal to and in proportion to the Capital Account Target Balances.
17.2.  Special Allocations.
        The following special allocations shall be made in the following order to the extent items of income, gain, loss, or deductions are available:
(a)
Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 17, if there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(d)(1)) during any Tax Year, each Shareholder shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Tax Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Tax Years) in an amount equal to such Shareholder's share of the net decrease in partnership minimum gain, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Shareholder pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 17.2(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(b)
Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 17, if there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain (determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(2)) attributable to a partner nonrecourse debt during any Tax Year, each Shareholder who has a share of the partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain attributable to such partner nonrecourse debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Tax Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Tax Years) in an amount equal to such Shareholder's share of the net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain attributable to such partner nonrecourse debt, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Shareholder pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 17.2(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(c)
Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Shareholder unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Company income and gain shall be specially allocated in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Shareholder as quickly as possible,
provided
,
however
, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 17.2(c) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Shareholder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Section 17.2 have been tentatively made as if this Section 17.2(c) were not contained in this Agreement.
(d)
Gross Income Allocation. In the event any Shareholder has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Tax Year which is in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Shareholder is obligated to restore pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Shareholder is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Shareholder shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 17.2(d)
shall be made only if and to the extent that such Shareholder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this Section 17.2 have been made as if Section 17.2(c) and this Section 17.2(d) were not contained in this Agreement. As among the Shareholders having such excess, if there are not sufficient items of income and gain to eliminate all such excesses, such allocations shall be made in proportion to the amount of any such excess.
(e)
Loss Limitation. The Losses allocated pursuant to Sections 17.1 and 17.2 (including net Losses created through a gross income allocation) shall not exceed the maximum amount of Losses that can be so allocated without causing any Shareholder to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit or an increase in such deficit at the end of any Tax Year. All Losses in excess of the limitations set forth in this Section 17.2(e) shall be allocated to the Shareholders that do not have Adjusted Capital Account Deficits in proportion to their Adjusted Capital Accounts.
(f)
Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse deductions, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(b)(1), for any Tax Year shall be allocated to the Shareholders in accordance with their Percentage Interests.
(g)
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner nonrecourse deductions, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(2), for any Tax Year shall be specially allocated to the Shareholder who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1).
(h)
Section 754 Election. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset under Code Section 732(d), 734(b), or 743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital Account balances, the amount of such adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) from the disposition of such asset and such gain or loss shall be allocated to the Shareholders in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.
(i)
Nonrecourse Debt. Excess nonrecourse liabilities, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), shall be allocated among the Shareholders in proportion to such Shareholders' Percentage Interests.
(j)
Section 482 Adjustments. If the Company is allowed any deduction by reason of a payment imputed to a Shareholder or Affiliate of a Shareholder under Section 482 of the Code or otherwise, the resulting deduction shall be allocated to such Shareholder, and such Shareholder shall be deemed to contribute an equivalent amount to the Company, resulting in no net change in such Shareholder's Capital Account. If the Company is imputed any income by reason of a payment imputed from a Shareholder or Affiliate of a Shareholder under Section 482 of the Code or otherwise, the resulting income shall be allocated to such Shareholder, and such Shareholder shall be deemed to receive as a distribution an equivalent amount from the Company, resulting in no net change in such Shareholder's Capital Account.
17.3.  Other Allocation Provisions
(a)
The allocations set forth in Sections 17.2(a)-(j) (the "
Regulatory Allocations
") are intended to comply with certain requirements of the Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the Shareholders that, to the extent possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Company income, gain, loss, or deduction pursuant to this Section 17.3. Therefore, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 17 (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Company shall make such offsetting special allocations of Company income, gain, loss, or deduction in whatever manner the Board reasonably determines is appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Shareholder's Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Shareholder would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not contained in this Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to this Section 17 without regard to the Regulatory Allocations. In exercising its discretion under this Section 17.3, the Board shall take into account future Regulatory Allocations under Sections 17.2(a) and (b) that, although not yet made, are likely to offset other Regulatory Allocations previously made under Sections 17.2(f) and (g).
(b)
Time of Allocation. Allocations of Profit and Loss and items of gross income shall be made to the Capital Accounts of the Shareholders on at least an annual basis, at the time of any sale of the assets of the Company not in the ordinary course of the business of the Company, at the time that the Gross Asset Values of the Company are adjusted pursuant to clause (b) of the definition of Gross Asset Value hereof, and at such other times as the Board shall determine. For purposes of determining the Profits, Losses, items of gross income, or any other items allocable to any period, Profits, Losses, items of gross income, and any such other items will be determined by the Company on a daily, monthly, or other basis, using any permissible method under Code Section 706 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
(c)
Other Items. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all items of Company income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and any other allocations not otherwise provided for shall be divided among the Shareholders in the same proportion as they share Profits or Losses, as the case may be, for the year.
17.4.  Tax Allocations
(a)
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise provided in Sections 17.4(b), 17.4(e) and 17.4(f), each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction shall be allocated among the Shareholders in the same manner as its corresponding item of book income, gain, loss, or deduction is allocated pursuant to Sections 17.1, 17.2 and 17.3.
(b)
In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any asset contributed to the capital of the Company by a Shareholder shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the Shareholders so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset to the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value, using the "traditional method with curative allocations" (as described in such Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(c)). In the case of any Section 1.752-7 Liability assumed by the Company from a Shareholder, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any such Section 1.752-7 Liability shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the Shareholders using the "traditional method" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(b), subject to Section 17.4(e).
(c)
(i) In the event that the aggregate allocation of depreciation and amortization deductions for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to assets contributed by the Shareholders to the Company pursuant to the first sentence of Section 17.4(b), increased or reduced, as the case may be, to take into account the effect of curative allocations of deduction, loss, income, or gain pursuant to such sentence (in aggregate, the "
Net Targeted Tax Deductions
") would result in the allocation of Net Targeted Tax Deductions to the Shareholders in a ratio that does not correspond to their respective Percentage Interests (the "
Target Ratio
"), and a Shareholder would have a shortfall in such Net
Targeted Tax Deductions (as compared to the amount that would have been allocated to such Shareholder if such Net Targeted Tax Deductions were allocated in accordance with the Target Ratio) that is in excess of $5 million in respect of a Tax Year of the Company, a sufficient amount of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of similar character (to the greatest extent possible for each relevant Tax Year) shall be specially allocated for Code Section 704(b) book and tax purposes among the Shareholders (the "Catchup Allocations") until the Net Targeted Tax Deductions, increased or reduced, as the case may be, by the Catchup Allocations made for Code Section 704(b) tax purposes (in accordance with Sections 17.4(a) and (b)), correspond to the Target Ratio. To the extent reasonably possible and administrable, the Catchup Allocations will consist first of items that do not differ for Code Section 704(b) book and tax purposes.
(ii)
For the avoidance of doubt, no allocation of any item of income, gain, loss, or deduction with respect to any Section 1.752-7 Liability will be governed by this Section17.4(c).
(iii)
Schedule 5 includes an allocation example that is intended to illustrate the mechanics of the allocations set forth in the Section 17.4(c).
(d)
For purposes of determining the nature (as ordinary or capital and, if capital, the applicable rate) of certain items of income and gain allocated among the Shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to this Section 17.4, any items of income and gain required to be recognized as ordinary income under Section 1245 or as "unrecaptured section 1250 gain" (as defined in Code Section 1(h)), shall be allocated among the Shareholders, to the extent possible, in the same proportion that the Shareholders were allocated and claimed the tax depreciation deductions or basis deductions, directly or indirectly, giving rise to such treatment under Code Sections 1(h) and 1245.
(e)
Allocation of Section 1.752-7 Liabilities.
(i)
The amount of any Section 1.752-7 Liability (the "
Section 1.752-7 Liability Amount
") shall be the present value of such liability immediately after its assumption by the Company, taking into account the Estimated Section 1.752-7 Liability Amounts and calculated on the same assumptions and using the same methodology as were used in calculating the Estimated Section 1.752-7 Liability Amounts, and shall be reflected by class on the Capital Account Schedule; provided, however, that the values of Section 1.752-7 Liabilities for IFRS financial statement purposes shall be treated as the present values of such liabilities (subject to the requirements in the first clause of this sentence regarding the calculation assumptions and methodology with respect to the Estimated Section 1.752-7 Liability Amounts) unless there is specific evidence of a more accurate value or the use of the financial statement value would be manifestly contrary to Law. The Parties agree that the pension and retiree benefit obligations of Molson Coors and its Subsidiaries and of Miller and its Subsidiaries, respectively, that are being assumed by the Company shall be reflected on the Capital Account Schedule as a single class and be treated for the purposes of this Section 17.4(e) as a single class of Section 1.752-7 Liabilities, and that the De Minimis Section 1.752-7 Liabilities that are being assumed by the Company shall be reflected on the Capital Account Schedule as a single class and be treated for the purposes of this Section 17.4(e) as a single class of Section 1.752-7 Liabilities.
(ii)
With respect to each class of Section 1.752-7 Liabilities reflected on the Capital Account Schedule, any deductions allowable for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of such class shall be allocated first to the Shareholders in proportion to such Section 1.752-7 Liabilities as reflected on the Capital Account Schedule for such class assumed from such Shareholders (or their Affiliates), at such time or times as such
deductions arise, until such Shareholders have been allocated for U.S. federal income tax purposes deductions equal to the Section 1.752-7 Liability Amounts with respect to the Section 1.752-7 Liabilities for such class assumed from such Shareholders (or their Affiliates).
(iii)
Thereafter, any deductions allowable for U.S. federal income tax purposes in respect of each class of Designated Section 1.752-7 Liabilities shall be allocated to the Shareholders, together with corresponding amounts of liabilities for book purposes, in proportion to such Designated Section 1.752-7 Liabilities as reflected on the Capital Account Schedule for such class assumed from such Shareholders (or their Affiliates), at such time or times as such deductions arise, until the total present value of deductions for such class allocated for U.S. federal income tax purposes to such Shareholders under this Section 17.4(e)(iii) and Section 17.4(e)(ii), discounted back to the time that such Designated Section 1.752-7 Liabilities were assumed by the Company using a discount rate equal to six percent (6%) per annum, are equal to the total Section 1.752-7 Liability Amounts with respect to the Designated Section 1.752-7 Liabilities for such class assumed from such Shareholders (or their Affiliates).
(iv)
Any additional deductions allowable for U.S. federal income tax purposes and book purposes in respect of a Section 1.752-7 Liability not governed by Section 17.4(e)(ii) or Section 17.4(e)(iii) shall be allocated among the Shareholders based on their respective Percentage Interests.
(v)
In the event that there is a decrease of a Section 1.752-7 Liability Amount that is reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Shareholders and that is treated as an item of income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-7(c)(1)(ii), such item of income shall be allocated to the Shareholder from whom such Section 1.752-7 Liability was assumed.
(vi)
Schedule 6 includes an allocation example that is intended to illustrate the mechanics of the allocations set forth in this Section 17.4(e).
(f)
Allocation of Deductions Related to Equity Awards.
(i)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) all allowable deductions or other expenses in respect of any Equity Award held by a Transferring CBC Employee and not paid, issued or settled directly by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates (provided, that for purposes of this Section 17.4(f), the Company shall not be considered an "Affiliate" of any Shareholder) shall be allocated for book and all applicable Tax purposes to CBC; and (ii) all allowable deductions or other expenses in respect of any Equity Award held by a Transferring Miller Employee and not paid, issued or settled directly by or on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates (provided, that for purposes of this Section 17.4(f), the Company shall not be considered an "Affiliate" of any Shareholder) shall be allocated for book and all applicable Tax purposes to Miller. In this Section 17.4(f), "Transferring CBC Employee" and "Transferring Miller Employee" shall have the meaning given to them in the JV Agreement.
(ii)
The Shareholder to whom a deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 17.4(f)(i) shall be treated as having made a Capital Contribution to the Company immediately prior to the time at which the deduction arises, in an amount equal to the deduction so allocated to such Shareholder.
17.5.  Interpretation Consistent With Regulations
(a)
The provisions of this Section 17 (and other related provisions in this Agreement) pertaining to the allocation of items of Company income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits are intended to comply with the Treasury Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(b)
All elections, decisions, and other matters concerning the allocation of Company income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits among the Shareholders, and accounting procedures, not specifically and expressly provided for by the terms of this Agreement, shall be determined by the Board in good faith. Such determination made in good faith by the Board, shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive as to the Shareholders.
18.   CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS.
18.1.  Non-voting interests
(a)
The Class B Shares will:
(i)
not carry a vote (and holders of such, in their capacities as Class B Shareholders, shall not be entitled to vote with respect to any matter relating to the Company, whether such voting right would otherwise exist or arise under the Delaware Act, at law, in equity or otherwise); and
(ii)
rank equally with the Class A Shares in relation to all other rights, including all rights relating to distributions, return of capital and liquidation.
(b)
Miller's Class B Shares shall be converted into Class A Shares upon a Change of Control of CBC pursuant to Section 19.1 or upon a failure to fund by CBC in accordance with Section 14 or upon a purchase by Miller of all (but not some only) of Molson Coors's Shares, but not otherwise.
18.2.  Exit provisions
(a)
Except as permitted by this Section 18.2 or with the prior written consent of all the other Shareholders, no Shareholder may Transfer any Shares or any legal or beneficial interest in any Shares during the Non-Transfer Period.
(b)
Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement any Transfer of any Shares by a Shareholder (the "
Original Transferor
") to any Wholly Owned Affiliate of the Original Transferor (the "
Transferee
") is permitted provided that:
(i)
the Original Transferor shall guarantee to the other Shareholders that the obligations of the Transferee shall be met and that such Transferee shall not, while a Shareholder, be put into receivership or liquidation; and
(ii)
if the Transferee ceases to be a Wholly Owned Affiliate of the Original Transferor or if the beneficial or economic interest in the Shares cease to be owned by a Wholly Owned Affiliate, the Transferee shall:
(1)
notify the Board in writing that such event has occurred; and
(2)
be bound to transfer the Shares back to the Original Transferor or to another Wholly Owned Affiliate of the Original Transferor.
(c)
Except where express provision to the contrary is made in this Agreement, the Parties shall procure that any transferee of or subscriber for Shares in the Company (whether an Affiliate of any Shareholder or not) and the ultimate Holding Company of such transferee or subscriber shall, prior to any Transfer or issue to it taking effect, have entered into a
counterpart to this Agreement (with such changes as shall be agreed by the Parties) and, provided that such transfer or subscription is not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall enter into such an agreement whenever requested to do so by any other Party to this Agreement. In connection with any Transfer of or subscription for Shares in the Company made pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement, the transferee of or subscriber for such Shares shall be admitted as a Shareholder with respect to such Shares when such person is listed on the Capital Account Schedule and upon compliance with the requirements of Section 3.1.
18.3.  After the expiration of the Non-Transfer Period, if a Shareholder (the "
Selling Shareholder
") proposes to sell all (it being understood that no Shareholder may sell less than all) of its Shares (the "
Sale Shares
") it shall give notice in writing of that fact (a "
Sale Notice
"), specifying the price at which it wishes to sell the Sale Shares (the "
Sale Price
") to the other Shareholder for cash. The Sale Notice must be in respect of all the Shares held by the Selling Shareholder. The recipient of the Sale Notice is referred to as a "
Non-Selling Shareholder
." The Selling Shareholder must give a Sale Notice to the Non-Selling Shareholder and complete the process set out in Sections 18.4 and 18.5 before contacting any potential purchaser (whether contact will be made by it or on its behalf).
18.4.  The Sale Notice shall invite the Non-Selling Shareholder to offer in writing (an "
Offer Notice
") to purchase the Sale Shares for cash at the Sale Price within 20 Business Days following delivery of the Sale Notice (the "
Offer Period
"). The Offer Notice must be in respect of all the Sale Shares and shall specify any conditions which the Non-Selling Shareholder considers are necessary or desirable to be satisfied in order for the purchase of the Sale Shares by the Non-Selling Shareholder to be completed.
18.5.  If an Offer Notice is received by the Selling Shareholder during the Offer Period it must accept the offer contained in the Offer Notice by notice in writing to the Non-Selling Shareholder unless it reasonably determines that any conditions set out in the Offer Notice are not likely to be satisfied within a nine-month period.
18.6.  If the Non-Selling Shareholder elects to purchase the Sale Shares it shall use its reasonable best efforts (including the provision of such information as may reasonably be required by any Governmental Authority) to obtain as soon as practicable any shareholder approval or Regulatory Approval and to satisfy any other condition which is set out in the Offer Notice and which has not already been obtained for the acquisition of the Sale Shares within nine months of acceptance by the Selling Shareholder or such longer period as may be agreed between the Selling Shareholder and the Non-Selling Shareholder unless a required approval has been finally denied (and during any such extended period the Non-Selling Shareholder's obligation to use its best efforts to satisfy such conditions shall survive).
18.7.  The Non-Selling Shareholder shall notify the Selling Shareholder and the Company in writing when all such approvals have been obtained and other conditions satisfied or, if it has so determined, that no such approvals are required (an "
Approval Notice
"). If any shareholder approval, Regulatory Approval or other condition which is set out in the Offer Notice is not obtained or satisfied within nine months or if any relevant Governmental Authority conclusively refuses to grant any such Regulatory Approval prior to the expiration of such period other than as a result of the failure of the Non-Selling Shareholder to use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate in obtaining such approval or satisfying such condition, then:
(a)
the transfer of the Sale Shares shall not proceed; and
(b)
the right of the Non-Selling Shareholder to acquire the Sale Shares and the Offer Notice shall cease to have effect.
18.8.  If:
(a)
no Offer Notice is received by the Selling Shareholder during the Offer Period; or
(b)
if an Offer Notice is received but the Offer Notice ceases to have effect as contemplated in Section 18.7,
the Selling Shareholder shall be entitled to transfer the Sale Shares in accordance with Sections 18.9 and 18.10 or to request the Non-Selling Shareholder to consider an IPO in accordance with Section 18.11.
18.9.  The Selling Shareholder shall then be entitled to proceed to sell the Sale Shares to a third party for cash (the "
Proposed Purchaser
") provided that:
(a)
the cash price at which the Sale Shares are proposed to be transferred or are transferred to the Proposed Purchaser shall not be less than the Sale Price;
(b)
prior to entering into an agreement with the Proposed Purchaser for the Sale Shares, the Selling Shareholder must notify in writing the Non-Selling Shareholder of the following:
(i)
the identity of the Proposed Purchaser;
(ii)
the price at which the Proposed Purchaser has agreed to acquire the Sale Shares; and
(iii)
all other financial terms and any other material terms and conditions of the proposed sale to the Proposed Purchaser (including the proposed form of all related agreements, annexes, schedules and related documentation),
(the "
Third Party Sale Notice
"); and
(c)
prior to entering into a binding agreement with the Proposed Purchaser for the Sale Shares, the Selling Shareholder must follow the process set out in Section 18.10.
18.10.  On receipt of the Third Party Sale Notice, the Non-Selling Shareholder may offer in writing, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the Third Party Sale Notice, to the Selling Shareholder to acquire the Sale Shares at a price which is at least five percent more than the price specified in the Third Party Sale Notice (the "
Last Offer Notice
"). If a Last Offer Notice is received by the Selling Shareholder it must accept the offer contained in the Last Offer Notice unless it reasonably determines that any conditions set out in the Last Offer Notice are not likely to be satisfied within a nine-month period. If the Last Offer Notice is accepted, the provisions of Sections 18.6 and 18.7 shall apply with the replacement of "Last Offer Notice" for "Offer Notice" each time it appears. If a Last Offer Notice has not been received or has not been accepted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence or has ceased to have effect pursuant to Section 18.7, the Selling Shareholder shall be entitled to enter into an agreement with the Proposed Purchaser within forty (40) Business Days thereafter to transfer the Sale Shares to the Proposed Purchaser for a price not less than that specified in the Third Party Sale Notice and on the other terms and conditions in the Third Party Sale Notice and to consummate the sale on that basis.
18.11.  IPO
        The Selling Shareholder may by notice in writing to the Non-Selling Shareholder (with a copy to all other parties) request the Non-Selling Shareholder to consider an IPO. If the Shareholders agree to implement an IPO, they shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and implement an IPO in the manner agreed between the Shareholders.
18.12.  Restrictions on Transfer
        In order to permit the Company to qualify for the benefit of a "safe harbor" under Code Section 7704, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Transfer of any Share or economic interest shall be permitted or recognized by the Company or the Board (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(d)) if and to the extent that such Transfer would cause the Company to have more than 100 partners (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h), including the look-through rule in Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)).
18.13.  Transfer Fees and Expenses
        The transferor and transferee of any Shares or other interest in the Company, but only the transferor in an IPO, shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay any transfer taxes and to reimburse the Company for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) of any Transfer or proposed Transfer, whether or not consummated.
18.14.  Void Transfers
        Any Transfer by any Shareholder of any Shares or other interest in the Company in contravention or violation of this Agreement or which would cause the Company to not be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be null and void ab initio and of no force or effect and shall not bind or be recognized by the Company or any other Party. No purported assignee of any Shares or other interests in the Company in contravention or violation of this Agreement shall have any rights hereunder or under the Delaware Act, including any right to any Profits, Losses or distributions of the Company, to appoint Directors or to have any other rights in the management of the Company.
19.   CHANGE OF CONTROL.
19.1.  Subject to Section 19.3, in the event of a Change of Control of CBC:
(a)
CBC shall notify Miller of such Change of Control as promptly as practicable upon it taking effect, and Miller will have the right, within 60 days of CBC's notification to Miller of such Change of Control taking effect, to convert its Class B Shares into Class A Shares and, if it does so, the number of Directors shall be increased by one and Miller shall be entitled to appoint one additional Director to the Board; and
(b)
if Miller exercises that right, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (other than Section 19.3), the provisions of Sections 5, 6 and 9 shall be amended as follows:
(i)
Sections 5.5(d) and (e) shall cease to apply and all decisions of the Board shall be determined by majority vote (including the affirmative vote of at least two Miller Directors) and the quorum for Board meetings will be a majority of the Directors (including at least two Miller Directors), provided that the affirmative vote of at least three CBC Directors will also be required to approve:
(1)
any of the matters described in Sections 9.1(f), 9.1(p), 9.1(s) and 9.1(t) (except in each case insofar as such matters have already been approved by the Board in accordance with Section 5.5(e));
(2)
any amendment to or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, including any change to the number of Directors constituting the Board (other than as provided in Section 19.1(a));
(3)
the issue of any equity interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity interests, by the Company or any Subsidiary to any entity which is not at Fair Market Value and in which CBC is not offered the opportunity to participate on a
pro rata basis, or the redemption or repurchase of such interests which is not at Fair Market Value and in which CBC is not offered the opportunity to participate on a pro rata basis;
(4)
any change with respect to the tax status of the Company;
(5)
instituting proceedings to have the Company adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent (or consenting thereto);
(6)
any transaction by the Company to merge or consolidate with and into another person, or any transaction or series of related transactions to sell, transfer, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets or rights of the Company to another person (other than a transaction or series of transactions which results in the Shareholders having the same proportionate economic interests in such other person as they had in the Company immediately beforehand);
(7)
any additional capital contribution that is not either:
(A)
consistent in timing and amount with the Annual Operating Plan; or
(B)
one in which both CBC and Miller are requested by the Board to participate, with commercially reasonable advance notice, on a pro rata basis in proportion to their respective holding of Shares in the Company; and
(8)
any proposal to liquidate or dissolve the Company (subject to Section 18-802 of the Delaware Act);
(ii)
if:
(1)
the person acquiring Control of CBC (the "
Acquirer
") has an existing controlling interest in a beer or beverage business in the United States which has a Market Share of four percent (4%) or more of the total U.S. beer market by volume ("
Existing Business
"); and
(2)
the Acquirer has offered the Existing Business to the Company at the Existing Business Price in accordance with Sections 19.5 and 19.6 (and, such offer having been accepted, has executed a definitive agreement on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company and complied with its obligations thereunder);
then in addition to the rights set out in Section 19.1(b)(i), the affirmative vote of at least three CBC Directors will be required in order to approve the matters described in Section 9.1(b) insofar as they relate to the Annual Operating Plan, but not insofar as they relate to any items of capital expenditure,
provided
,
however
that if:
(3)
the Acquirer does not offer the Existing Business to the Company at the Existing Business Price in accordance with Sections 19.5 to 19.10 (or, such offer having been made and accepted by the Company, does not execute a definitive agreement on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company to effect such sale and comply with its obligations thereunder); or
(4)
(A) the Acquirer does offer the Existing Business to the Company at the Existing Business Price in accordance with Sections 19.5 and 19.6 but the Company does not acquire the Existing Business as a result of a legal impediment or inability to obtain Regulatory Approval referred to in Section 19.8, (B) the Acquirer does not enter into sales, marketing and distribution arrangements as contemplated in Section 19.8 (either as a result of the legal impediment or inability to obtain Regulatory Approval referred to in Section 19.8 or as a result of the Acquirer's unwillingness to enter into
such arrangements), and (C) the Acquirer does not dispose of its entire interest in the Existing Business to an unrelated third party within six months, plus such reasonable time as is necessary to obtain any required Regulatory Approval, of the legal impediment arising or the inability to obtain Regulatory Approval referred to in Section 19.8,
then the affirmative vote of at least three CBC Directors will be required to approve the matters set out in Section 19.1(b)(i) but no other matters;
(iii)
in addition to the provisions set out in Section 19.1(b)(i), the affirmative vote of at least three CBC Directors will be required in order to approve the matters described in Section 9.1(c) but only if and for so long as Coors Light has a Market Share of two percent (2%) or more of the total Canadian beer market by volume;
(iv)
Miller shall be entitled at all times to appoint the Chairman with CBC being entitled at all times to appoint the Vice Chairman;
(v)
the number of Directors on each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committee shall be increased by one and Miller shall be entitled to appoint an additional nominee to each of such Committees and shall at all times be entitled to appoint the chairman of each of those Committees;
(vi)
the appointment and removal of the CEO shall become a matter for the Board without regard to Section 7; and
(vii)
Section 9 shall cease to apply.
19.2.  Subject to Section 19.3, in the event of a Change of Control of Miller:
(a)
Miller shall notify CBC of such Change of Control as promptly as practicable upon it taking effect, and CBC will be entitled to acquire from Miller, by notice in writing to Miller given within 60 days of Miller's notification to CBC of such Change of Control taking effect, for cash, such number of Class B Shares held by Miller as would increase CBC's ownership of the Class B Shares to fifty percent (50%), at a price which represents Fair Market Value as determined in accordance with Section 19.4 (provided that if such Fair Market Value is greater than an amount equal to 24.99% of SABMiller's market capitalization at the time less the value attributable, as at the date of this Agreement, to the business contributed by Miller to the Company pursuant to the JV Agreement (the "
Class 1 Amount
"), then the disposition by Miller of Class B Shares shall be subject to SABMiller shareholder approval, and if such approval is not obtained within three months of CBC giving notice in writing to Miller that it wishes to acquire such Class B Shares, then the price for the Class B Shares shall be the Class 1 Amount);
(b)
if CBC exercises that right and closes on such purchase of Class B Shares, then:
(i)
the provisions of Sections 7.2(d) and (e) (so far as still applicable) shall be amended such that all references to CBC shall be replaced by references to Miller and all references to Miller shall be replaced by references to CBC; and
(ii)
the Audit Committee Charter, the Compensation Committee Charter and the Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committee Charter shall be amended to provide that CBC shall be entitled to appoint the Chairmen of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Ethics, Compliance and Corporate Responsibility Committee; and
(iii)
CBC shall have the right to require Miller to cause that the Miller Directors vote in favor of any Board resolution to appoint a person nominated by CBC as the CEO and to remove the existing CEO, provided that nothing herein shall limit the CEO's rights or remedies under any employment agreement, including with respect to the term of employment.
19.3.  Section 19.1 will not apply if Miller has previously been the subject of a Change of Control and CBC has exercised its right under Section 19.2(a). Section 19.2 will not apply if CBC has previously been the subject of a Change of Control and Miller has exercised its right under Section 19.1(a).
19.4.  For the purposes of Section 19.2(a) the Fair Market Value of the Class B Shares shall be determined by an Independent Investment Bank in accordance with the criteria set forth on Schedule 4, the cost of which shall be borne by the Company.
19.5.  Within twenty (20) Business Days following a Change of Control of CBC, any Acquirer who has an Existing Business may offer the Existing Business to the Company for cash at its good faith estimate of the fair market value of the Existing Business. Unless the Miller Directors disagree with the Acquirer's estimate of the fair market value of the Existing Business within ten (10) Business Days, such estimate shall be the "
Existing Business Price
".
19.6.  If the Miller Directors disagree with the Acquirer's estimate of the Existing Business Price, the Board shall appoint two independent investment banks of international repute (one of which shall appointed by each Shareholder) to opine as to the appropriate price for the Existing Business. Molson Coors and CBC shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Acquirer to cooperate with the banks in their valuation process and shall share any relevant materials it has regarding valuation with the banks (but not the other Shareholder). If the difference between the two valuations is no more than ten percent (10%) of the higher valuation, the Existing Business Price shall be the average of the two valuations. If the difference is more than ten percent (10%) of the higher valuation, then the Board (or, if the Board (acting in good faith) cannot agree, the CEO) shall appoint a third independent investment bank of international repute to determine which of the two valuations is more appropriate and the valuation determined by such third investment bank shall be the Existing Business Price.
19.7.  Subject to Section 19.8, the Company shall be obligated to acquire the Existing Business at the Existing Business Price.
19.8.  In the event that (i) there is a legal impediment to the Company acquiring the Existing Business, such as a contractual restriction on such transfer, or (ii) the Board approves the acquisition of the Existing Business but after having used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary Regulatory Approval, such Regulatory Approval is not forthcoming or is forthcoming on terms not reasonably acceptable to the Board, the Company shall not be obligated to acquire the Existing Business but shall, if the Acquirer is willing to do so:
(a)
enter into agreements for the sales, marketing and distribution of the brands of the Existing Business in the United States through the MillerCoors Group on an arm's-length basis on cost-plus and other terms to be agreed between the Acquirer and the Company; and
(b)
treat the relevant brands as an integral part of the MillerCoors Group's brand portfolio.
19.9.  If, due to the legal impediment or inability to obtain Regulatory Approval referred to above, it is not possible to put in place the arrangements referred to in Section 19.8, then the Company shall not be obligated to enter into such arrangements and Section 19.1(b)(ii) shall apply.
19.10.  Any acquisition by the Company pursuant to this Section 19 shall be funded by debt to the extent consistent with the Company's debt policy at the relevant time. Any additional financing required to fund the acquisition cost of an Existing Business shall be provided by the Shareholders in proportion to their holdings of Shares and Sections 13 and 14 shall apply to such funding.
20.   NON-COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION.
20.1.  Subject to Section 21, except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Brand Cooperation Agreement or the Contract Brewing Agreements, each Party undertakes that until such Party's Group no longer owns any Shares, it will not (and shall cause the members of its Group not to) whether as principal, agent, partner, representative, shareholder, consultant, advisor, financier or in any other capacity, directly or indirectly, be associated or concerned with or interested or engaged in or by any firm, business, company or other association of persons involved directly or indirectly in the manufacture, distribution, marketing or sale of (i) Beer in the Territory or (ii) other beverages in the Territory using any Trademark including the word "Miller" or "Coors", without the consent of the CEO, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
20.2.  Subject to Section 20.3, each Shareholder undertakes that until either Party's Group no longer owns any Shares, it will not (and shall cause the members of its Group and the members of the MillerCoors Group not to) solicit for employment or employ any person who is an employee of the MillerCoors Group or an employee of the other Shareholder's Group having regular responsibility for or interaction with the Company or who has resigned from his or her position as an employee of the MillerCoors Group or such an employee of the other Shareholder's Group in the previous 12 months, except with the written approval of the Company, SABMiller or Molson Coors, as the case may be (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

21.   INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS.
21.1.  Notwithstanding Section 20, either Shareholder or its Affiliates (the "
Acquiring Party
") may acquire a Beer business which would, but for the provisions of this Section 21, amount to a breach of the undertaking in Section 20.1 (such portion of the acquisition that so competes, the "
Competing Business
") as part of a larger acquisition which is not made with the sole or main purpose of acquiring the Competing Business, provided that:
(a)
the gross sales of the Competing Business in the last financial year of that Competing Business is not greater than forty-nine percent (49%) of the gross sales in the same period of the total businesses so acquired; and
(b)
within twenty (20) Business Days following the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire the Competing Business, the Acquiring Party shall offer the Competing Business to the Company for cash at its good faith estimate of the "
Implied Acquisition Price
," which shall be equal to the fair market value of the Competing Business taking into account the price paid by the Acquiring Party for the entire business.
21.2.  If those members of the Board who are not appointed by the Acquiring Party disagree with the Acquiring Party's estimate of the Implied Acquisition Price, the Board shall appoint two independent investment banks of international repute (one of which shall be the bank which advised the Acquiring Party on the initial acquisition or, if none, shall be appointed by the Acquiring Party's Directors, and the other shall be appointed by the other Shareholder) to opine as to the appropriate price for the Competing Business. The Acquiring Party shall cooperate with the banks in their valuation process and shall share any relevant materials it has regarding valuation with the banks (but not the other Shareholder). If the difference between the two valuations is no more than ten percent (10%) of the higher valuation, the price to be paid by the Company for the Competing Business (the "
Valued Price
") shall be the average of the two valuations. If the difference is more than ten percent (10%) of the higher valuation, then the Board (or, if the Board cannot agree, the CEO) shall appoint a third independent investment bank of international repute to determine which of the two valuations is more appropriate. The Implied Acquisition Price, if accepted by those members of the Board who are not nominated by the Acquiring Party, or such determination of the Valued Price by the relevant independent
investment bank, shall be final and shall be deemed to be the "
Final Price
" for the purposes of Section 21.3.
21.3.  Subject to Sections 21.4 and 21.5, the Company shall be obligated to acquire, and the Acquiring Party shall be obligated to sell, the Competing Business at the Final Price.
21.4.  In the event that (i) there is a legal impediment to the Company acquiring the Competing Business, such as a contractual restriction on such transfer, which cannot be eliminated through the use of commercially reasonable efforts or (ii) the Board approves the acquisition of the Competing Business but after having used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary Regulatory Approval, such Regulatory Approval is not forthcoming or is forthcoming on terms not reasonably acceptable to the Directors appointed by the Shareholder who is not (or whose Affiliate is not) the Acquiring Party, the Acquiring Party shall be entitled to retain ownership of the Competing Business provided that:
(a)
the Acquiring Party and the Company shall enter into agreements for the sales, marketing and distribution of the brands of the Competing Business in the United States through the MillerCoors Group on an arm's-length basis on cost-plus and other terms to be agreed between the Acquiring Party and the Company; and
(b)
the Company shall treat the relevant brands as an integral part of the MillerCoors Group's brand portfolio.
21.5.  If, due to the legal impediment or inability to obtain Regulatory Approval referred to above, it is not possible to put in place the arrangements referred to in Section 21.4, then the Acquiring Party shall dispose of the Competing Business within the following six months plus such reasonable period of time as is necessary to obtain any required Regulatory Approval, at a price to be determined by the Acquiring Party.
21.6.  Any acquisition by the Company pursuant to this Section 21 shall be funded by debt to the extent consistent with the Company's debt policy at the relevant time. Any additional financing required to fund the acquisition cost of a Competing Business shall be provided by the Shareholders in proportion to their holdings of Shares and Sections 13 and 14 shall apply to such funding.
21.7.  If the Acquiring Party is an Affiliate of a Shareholder a reference in this Section 21 to obligations of the Acquiring Party shall be construed as obligations of the relevant Shareholder to cause the Acquiring Party to perform such obligations.
22.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.
22.1.  All transactions between members of the Molson Coors Group or the SABMiller Group, on the one hand, and members of the MillerCoors Group, on the other hand, shall be entered into on an arm's-length basis and on terms which are customary for transactions of that nature between unrelated third parties.
22.2.  Where the Company requires goods or services which can be provided by one of the Shareholders to the required standard and on terms which are at least as favorable as those available from independent third parties, the Company shall (subject always to Board approval) obtain such goods or services from the relevant Shareholder.
22.3.  The CEO and other members of the Executive Committee will discuss with the Shareholders whether it is in the best interests of the Group to share services with one or both of the Shareholders, including through the establishment of a shared services center between the Shareholders and members of the MillerCoors Group. If the CEO (after consultation with the other members of the Executive Committee) determines that it would be in the best interests of the Group to enter into such a shared service arrangement with one or both Shareholders, the
Shareholders will procure that the Company and the relevant Shareholder enters into such a shared services arrangement on arm's-length terms (such terms to be subject to Board approval).
22.4.  For the purposes of this Agreement, licensing and related arrangements between the Company and the Shareholders (including the Brand Cooperation Agreement and any agreement entered into pursuant to it, any Services Agreement or a Contract Brewing Agreement) will not be treated as related party.
23.   TERMINATION.
23.1.  Either Shareholder will be entitled to dissolve the Company:
(a)
in the event that an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the other Shareholder (or any Holding Company of that Shareholder); or
(b)
if the other Shareholder (or its Ultimate Holding Company) is the subject of a criminal indictment in the U.S., the United Kingdom or, in the case of Molson Coors, Canada, and the existence of such indictment has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, directly or indirectly, a material adverse effect on the business, condition or results of operations of the relevant Shareholder's Group, taken as a whole; or
(c)
if the other Shareholder agrees.
23.2.  Prior to dissolving the Company pursuant to Section 23.1(a) or Section 23.1(b), the Shareholder having the right to dissolve the Company pursuant to Section 23.1 shall be entitled to acquire the entire interest of the other Shareholder in the Company at a price per Share which represents Fair Market Value as determined by Section 23.3.

A disputing Party shall initiate the attempted amicable settlement process by sending written notice of the Dispute to the other Parties, and within ten (10) Business Days after such notice, the Molson Coors CEO and the SABMiller CEO shall meet, in person or by telephone, for attempted resolution by negotiations. Each of the Parties' representatives set forth in this Section 29.2 shall be empowered and authorized to bind their respective companies with respect to the Dispute and to settle the Dispute on behalf of their respective companies. If for any reason the Dispute is not resolved within 20 Business Days of the date of the written notice of the Dispute, the Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 29.3.
29.3.  Any Dispute (other than a Dispute as to a Reserved Matter, any such Dispute to be finally resolved in accordance with Section 12) not otherwise resolved pursuant to Section 29.2 shall be referred to and finally resolved by international arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. Judgment upon any award(s) rendered by the arbitral tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
29.4.  The seat of arbitration shall be New York City, New York, USA.
29.5.  The number of arbitrators shall be three, one nominated by the claimant, or jointly by multiple claimants, in the Request for Arbitration, one nominated by the respondent, or jointly by multiple respondents, in the Response and the chairman nominated by the two Party-nominated arbitrators within fifteen (15) Business Days of the appointment of the second arbitrator by the LCIA Court, failing which the chairman shall be appointed by the LCIA Court. Where there is more than one claimant and/or more than one respondent, unless otherwise agreed the parties to the Dispute hereby agree that they represent two separate sides for the purposes of the formation of the arbitral tribunal as Claimant and Respondent respectively.
29.6.  The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.
29.7.  The arbitral tribunal shall be guided by the IBA Rules of Evidence. An agreement of the Parties and the LCIA Rules (in that order) shall at all times prevail over an inconsistent provision in the IBA Rules of Evidence.

The Parties agree that an arbitral tribunal constituted under this Agreement may, upon application by any party to the arbitration before it, order that the arbitration be consolidated with any other arbitration or proposed arbitration under this Agreement and/or the Joint Venture Agreement and/or the Brand Cooperation Agreement if either (1) all of the parties to the relevant arbitrations or proposed arbitrations agree to such consolidation, or (2) the relevant arbitrations or proposed arbitrations involve common issues of fact or law and the arbitral tribunal in receipt of such an application is satisfied that such consolidation will provide a fair and efficient means for the final resolution of the parties' disputes and will not cause undue prejudice to any party.
29.9.  In the event of different rulings on the question of consolidation by different arbitral tribunals constituted under this Agreement and/or the Joint Venture Agreement and/or the Brand Cooperation Agreement, the ruling of the first arbitral tribunal to be fully appointed (the "

For the avoidance of doubt, such court shall decide an Interim Relief Application in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof) pursuant to Section 38. Without prejudice to the ability of any party to make an Interim Relief Application before any court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties agree that the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (or, if subject matter jurisdiction is unavailable, the state courts of the State of Delaware) shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of any Interim Relief Application.

For purposes of implementing the Parties' agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of Delaware, each such Party that has not as of the date hereof already duly appointed such an agent does hereby appoint CT Corporation Services as such agent.
29.11.  The Parties agree that the documents which initiate any court proceeding on an Interim Relief Application or any court proceeding to enforce this Section 29 or an award rendered hereunder, and any other documents required to be served in relation to any such proceeding, may be served on the parties in accordance with Section 32 regardless of where such proceeding is initiated. These documents may, however, be served in any other manner allowed by law.
30.   FURTHER ASSURANCE.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Separation Agreement on the date first written above.
Exhibit A
        I, Timothy V. Wolf, in consideration of and subject to the performance by Molson Coors Brewing Company, a Delaware corporation (the "
Company
"), of its obligations under the Separation Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2008 (the "
Separation Agreement
"), do hereby release and forever discharge as of the date hereof the Company and its affiliates and all present and former directors, officers, agents, representatives, employees, successors and assigns of the Company and its affiliates and the Company's direct or indirect owners (collectively, the "
Released Parties
") to the extent provided below.
        1)    I understand that any payments or benefits paid or granted to me under the Separation Agreement on or after the date hereof represent, in part, consideration for signing this General Release and are not salary, wages or benefits to which I was already entitled. I understand and agree that I will not receive such payments and benefits specified in the Separation Agreement unless I execute this General Release and do not revoke or breach this General Release. Such payments and benefits will not be considered compensation for purposes of any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained or hereafter established by the Company or its affiliates. I also acknowledge and represent that I have received all payments and benefits that I am entitled to receive (as of the date hereof) by virtue of any employment by the Company.
        2)    Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 9 below and except for those provisions arising out of the performance of the Separation Agreement which expressly survive the termination of my employment with the Company, I knowingly and voluntarily (for myself and my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns) release and forever discharge the Company and the other Released Parties from any and all claims, suits, controversies, actions, causes of action, cross-claims, counter-claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and attorneys' fees, or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity, both past and present (through the date this General Release becomes effective and enforceable) and whether known or unknown, suspected, or claimed against the Company or any of the Released Parties that I, my spouse, or any of my heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, may have, which arise out of or are connected with my employment with, or my separation or termination from, the Company (including, but not limited to, any allegation, claim or violation, arising under: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act); the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (except as provided in paragraph 8 below); any applicable Executive Order Programs; the Fair Labor Standards Act; or their state or local counterparts; or under any other federal, state or local civil or human rights law, or under any other local, state, or federal law, regulation or ordinance; or under any public policy, contract or tort, or under common law; or arising under any policies, practices or procedures of the Company; or any claim for wrongful discharge, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, defamation; or any claim for costs, fees, or other expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred in these matters) (all of the foregoing are collectively referred to herein as the "
Claims
").
        3)    I represent that I have made no assignment or transfer of any right, claim, demand, cause of action, or other matter covered by paragraph 2 above.
        4)    I agree that this General Release does not waive or release any rights or claims that I may have (a) under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 which arise after the date I execute this General Release, (b) with respect to any options to acquire common stock of the Company which I may exercise after the Separation Date as a result of Section 4 of the Separation Agreement, (c) with respect to any vested benefits (including, but not limited to, 401(k) or other vested retirement benefits) or (d) for claims which cannot be released as a matter of law. I acknowledge and agree that my
separation from employment with the Company is in compliance with the terms of the Separation Agreement and company policy and shall not serve as the basis for any Claim (including, without limitation, any claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967). I further agree that this General Release does not include or limit in any way my rights to indemnification pursuant to the Company's articles of incorporation, by-laws, and/or policies.
        5)    I agree that I am waiving all rights to sue or obtain equitable, remedial or punitive relief from any or all Released Parties of any kind whatsoever, including, without limitation, reinstatement, back pay, front pay, attorneys' fees and any form of injunctive relief. Notwithstanding the above, I further acknowledge that I am not waiving and am not being required to waive any right that cannot be waived under law, including the right to file an administrative charge or participate in an administrative investigation or proceeding; provided, however that I disclaim and waive any right to share or participate in any monetary award resulting from the prosecution of such charge or investigation or proceeding.
        6)    In signing this General Release, I acknowledge and intend that it shall be effective as a bar to each and every one of the Claims hereinabove mentioned or implied. I covenant and agree that I will not file or institute at any time hereafter any Claim (whether arising out of or connected with my employment with, or my separation or termination from, the Company or otherwise) against any of the Released Parties. I agree that filing or instituting any such Claims would be a material breach of this General Release. I expressly consent that this General Release shall be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those relating to unknown and unsuspected Claims (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated Claims), if any, as well as those relating to any other Claims hereinabove mentioned or implied. I acknowledge and agree that this waiver and agreement not to bring any Claim is an essential and material term of this General Release and that without such waiver and agreement not to bring any Claim the Company would not have agreed to the terms of the Separation Agreement. I further agree that in the event I should bring a Claim seeking damages against the Company, or in the event I should seek to recover against the Company in any Claim brought by a governmental agency on my behalf, this General Release shall serve as a complete defense to such Claims to the maximum extent permitted by law. I further agree that I am not aware of any pending Claim of the type described in paragraph 2 above as of the execution of this General Release and I represent and warrant to the Company that I have not filed or instituted any Claim against any of the Released Parties.
        7)    I represent that I am not aware of any claim by me other than the claims that are released by this Agreement. I acknowledge that I may hereafter discover claims or facts in addition to or different than those which I now know or believe to exist with respect to the subject matter of the release set forth in paragraph 2 above and which, if known or suspected at the time of entering into this General Release, may have materially affected this General Release and my decision to enter into it. Nevertheless, I hereby waive any right, claim or cause of action that might arise as a result of such different or additional claims or facts.
        8)    I agree that neither this General Release, nor the furnishing of the consideration for this General Release, shall be deemed or construed at any time to be an admission by the Company, any Released Party or myself of any improper or unlawful conduct.
        9)    I agree that I will forfeit all amounts payable by the Company pursuant to or referenced in the Separation Agreement (including, without limitation, the benefits referenced in paragraphs 2(a) and 4 thereof) if I challenge the validity of this General Release. I also agree that if I violate this General Release by suing the Company or the other Released Parties, I will pay all costs and expenses of defending against the suit incurred by the Released Parties, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and return all payments received by me pursuant to or referenced in the Separation Agreement. I
understand that this paragraph 9 does not apply if I file a charge or lawsuit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (an "
