DENVER, Colo., and MONTREAL, Quebec 
Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today reported higher income for the first quarter ending March 29, 2009.
 
Peter Swinburn, Molson Coors president and chief executive officer, said In the first quarter, our strong brands, strategic initiatives, cost reductions and lower incentive compensation drove 75 percent profit growth for our company.  We also achieved positive pricing and local-currency profit growth in each of our major markets. These positive factors more than offset continuing commodity inflation, unfavorable currency movements, a higher tax rate, and lower volume, particularly in the U.K.  We are pleased with the bottom-line momentum we have achieved leading into the peak summer selling season, but we nonetheless remain cautious about the rest of the year due to uncertainty around currency exchange rates and beer market volume trends, plus continuing commodity price inflation.
First Quarter Highlights
(1)
 
Key operating and financial highlights for the Companys fiscal first quarter ended March 29, 2009, compared to the fiscal first quarter ended March 30, 2008, include the following:
 
First quarter 2009 results reflect the Companys adoption of new accounting standards for convertible debt (FSP APB14) and Non-controlling Interests in Financial Statements (FAS160), as well as the adoption of hectoliters as its standard global volume measure. Prior period results presented have been adjusted to reflect these changes.
(1)
The Company calculates non-GAAP underlying income by excluding special and other one-time items from the nearest U.S. GAAP earnings measure.  To calculate underlying income in the first quarter of 2009, the Company excluded one-time expenses, particularly related to MillerCoors and the Fosters cash-settled total-return swap, as well as net special charges of $10.2 million pretax.  For further details, please see the section Special and Other One-Time Items below, along with tables for reconciliations to the nearest U.S. GAAP measures.  All $ amounts are in U.S. Dollars.

Molson Coors Brewing Company
The Companys effective tax rate during the first quarter 2009 for income from continuing operations was negative 2 percent on a reported basis, and positive 8 percent on an underlying basis. These rates are lower than the Companys expected annual rate for 2009 because of the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in the quarter. The Company estimates that its full-year 2009 effective tax rate will be in the range of 16 percent to 20 percent on an underlying basis.
During the quarter, Molson Coors achieved an incremental $18 million of cost savings as part of its three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth (RFG) cost savings program. These cost savings include the companys 42 percent share of RFG cost savings initiatives that were achieved by MillerCoors, which equaled $3 million in the first quarter.
MillerCoors further accelerated synergy delivery timing, realizing $50 million in the first quarter which captures some savings originally planned for delivery in the second quarter.  A total of $78 million in synergy savings has been realized since July 1, 2008, exceeding the companys original goal of $50 million for the first 12 months of operations. The company now expects to realize $128 million of synergies by June 30, 2009. 
By the end of calendar year 2009, MillerCoors expects to achieve a total of $238 million in synergies, surpassing its original forecast of $225 million.  While the timing of synergy delivery has accelerated, MillerCoors $500 million synergy goal is unchanged.
Molson Coors Brewing Companys total worldwide beer volume was 10.516 million hectoliters in the quarter, 2.7 percent lower versus the prior year on a pro forma basis, as shown in Table 1 below.

Business Segments
Following are the Companys 2009 first quarter results by business segment:
Canada Business
The Canada business reported underlying pretax income of $58.1 million in the first quarter, a 9.4 percent decrease from the same period last year, as gains in the base business were more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.  The year-over-year depreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollarwas 20 percent, which reduced the Canada segment underlying income by approximately $12 million.  In local currency, Canada underlying pretax income was more than 13 percent higher than the first quarter 2008.
      
 
Canada sales-to-retail (STR) decreased 3.2 percent in the first quarter versus last year, resulting in a market-share decrease of about three-quarters of a share point.  Strategic brand changes were led by double-digit growth of Coors Light and mid-single-digit growth by Carling, offset by the decline of partner imports, Molson Canadian and non-strategic brands. This deceleration versus first quarter 2008 was driven by soft industry volumes and the Companys decision to limit participation in off-premise discounting in a number of provinces during the quarter. Canada beer industry volumes declined an estimated 1.2 percent in the quarter.
Canada sales volume was 1.8 million hectoliters, virtually unchanged versus 2008.  Comparable net sales per hectoliter increased 2.0 percent in local currency, led by price increases across all major markets, partially offset by continued discounting activity.
(3)
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.4 percent on a comparable basis in local currency, primarily due to a 2.5 percent inflationary increase in commodities, packaging materials and distribution. About a third of these inflationary increases were offset by savings from cost reduction initiatives. Additional cost increase drivers include a 1 percent increase in overhead expenses and ongoing sales mix shifts.
Comparable marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.7 percent in local currency, driven by lower overhead expense and cycling higher long-term incentive compensation costs in the prior year.
Other income increased due to $2.7 million of pretax gains from foreign currency hedges.
  Except where otherwise indicated, comparable Canada results exclude the deconsolidation of Brewers Retail Inc. in Ontario on March 1, 2009, and effects of forming MillerCoors in 2008. Comparable results exclude the year-over-year impact for beer sales to MillerCoors.  With the completion of the MillerCoors joint venture, the financial impact of our brand exports to the U.S. are no longer being treated as inter-company sales and eliminated upon consolidation of total Molson Coors results.  Sales volume for these U.S. exports are excluded from Canada results and are now reported by MillerCoors.

United States Business (MillerCoors)
(4)
Molson Coors underlying U.S. segment pretax income increased 52.3 percent to $94.2 million in the first quarter due to strong underlying income growth by MillerCoors.  U.S. segment results include the Companys 42 percent share of net income attributable to MillerCoors and various adjustments for the equity income calculation under U.S. GAAP, as shown in Table 5 below.
MillerCoors Operating and Financial Highlights (U.S. GAAP)
For the first quarter, underlying net income attributable to MillerCoors, excluding special items, increased 46.3 percent to $216.4 million from the prior year pro forma result, driven by accelerated synergy delivery, strong revenue growth, disciplined cost management, and phasing of marketing expenditure, despite continuing commodity cost pressures.
MillerCoors domestic STRs increased 0.4 percent versus the prior year pro forma quarter due to strong results from five of the six focus brands, offset primarily by declines in Miller Lite and Milwaukees Best.
Domestic sales-to-wholesalers (STWs) declined 1 percent versus prior year, while total STWs declined 2 percent, driven by a double-digit reduction in contract brewing volumes.
MillerCoors total net sales increased by 3.8 percent to $1.716 billion versus the prior quarter.  Excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, net sales increased 4.5 percent to $1.609 billion.  Third-party contract brewing volumes declined 10 percent, though profits from contract brewing increased slightly.
pro forma
Pricing remained strong in the first quarter as domestic net sales per hectoliter, excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 5.6 percent based on 2008 price increases (in the first and fourth quarters) and reductions in discounting.  Pricing growth was lower than the previous quarter due to cycling of early 2008 general price increases.
Though MillerCoors continues to realize supply chain related synergies and deliver savings from its cost leadership programs  Resources For Growth and Project Unicorn  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) per hectoliter increased by 5.3 percent due to significant increases in brewing and packaging materials related to high commodity costs last year.
For the quarter, marketing, general and administrative costs decreased by 9.1 percent driven by timing and management of marketing and sales spending and the accelerated timing of synergy delivery.
Depreciation and amortization expense for MillerCoors in the first quarter was approximately $71 million, and additions to tangible and intangible assets totaled $97 million.
MillerCoors, a U.S. joint venture of Molson Coors Brewing Company and SABMiller plc, was launched on

July 1, 2008.  Molson Coors has a 42 percent economic interest in MillerCoors which is accounted for using the equity method.  Molson Coors interest in MillerCoors results, along with certain adjustments under U.S. GAAP, are reflected in Equity Investment Income in MillerCoors.  Historical period results have not been reclassified to conform to this presentation, so year-over-year comparisons of consolidated and U.S. segment volume, net sales, cost of goods sold, and marketing, general and administrative results are less meaningful.  For comparability, the parent companies of MillerCoors have provided a full income statement for first quarter 2009, along with pro forma results for the prior year period.  This release also includes reconciliation from MillerCoors Net Income to Molson Coors Brewing Company Equity Investment Income in MillerCoors (see Table 5) and Non-GAAP U.S. Segment Underlying Pretax Income (see Table 4).
 
 
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
United Kingdom Business
The U.K. business reported underlying pretax income of $3.5 million in the first quarter, an improvement of $5.5 million versus the same quarter last year. A 28 percent decline in the value of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar reduced underlying pretax income by approximately $2 million.  This represents the companys best first quarter U.K. profit performance in five years, driven by strong pricing growth, the ramp-up of its contract brewing arrangement, and reduced marketing and pension costs, partly offset by lower volumes and higher input cost inflation.
U.K. owned-brand volume decreased 13.8 percent during the quarter, while the beer industry declined 8 percent, reflecting a weak economy in the U.K. The Company under-performed the market, as it took a firm stance with customers on pricing.
In local currency, comparable U.K. net sales per hectoliter of owned products increased 11.6 percent, nearly three-quarters driven by higher net pricing in all channels, with the balance of the increase attributable to positive sales mix.
Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter for owned brands increased 5.2 percent in local currency in the first quarter, due primarily to higher input cost inflation, partly offset by results of cost-reduction initiatives and lower pension costs.
  Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased 2.7 percent in local currency due to lower pensions and marketing expenses in the first quarter.
Global Markets Business and Corporate
The Companys Global Markets business grew volume nearly 26 percent, on a small base, driven by the strength of Coors Light in China and Carling in Europe.  Marketing, general and administrative expense for Global Markets was $11 million in the quarter, an increase of $2.8 million versus a year ago.
Corporate general and administrative expense was $21.1 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $7.8 million, driven by lower employee incentive compensation this year.
Corporate net interest expense was $21.9 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $8.7 million compared to a year ago, with about $5 million of this reduction attributable to foreign currency movements and the balance due to BRI deconsolidation.  In the quarter, Corporate other expense of $21.9 million was driven by a one-time mark-to-market expense related to the Fosters cash-settled total-return swap.  The underlying pretax loss for Global Markets and Corporate was $48.4 million, a 22.1 percent decrease versus the first quarter of 2008.

Special and Other One-Time Items
During the first quarter 2009, the Company reported net special charges of $10.2 million pretax, which was composed primarily of Canada severance and pension curtailment charges of $7.5 million and Edmonton Brewery closure costs of $0.7 million, as well as U.K. restructuring costs of $0.9 million.
Corporate other expense in the quarter included a $21.4 million one-time, non-cash mark-to-market expense related to the cash-settled total-return swap the Company arranged with respect to Fosters common stock in 2008.
During the first quarter of 2009, MillerCoors reported special or exceptional items totaling $10.4 million, including employee retention and relocation expenses. This equates to $4.4 million at Molson Coors 42 percent ownership share.
These special and other one-time items have been excluded from underlying earnings in the first quarter 2009.
Discontinued Operations
The Company reports results associated with its former Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser (Kaiser), as discontinued operations.  The Company reported a loss of $3.9 million from discontinued operations during the quarter primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Kaiser indemnity estimates.

Pretax and After-Tax Underlying Income should be viewed as a supplement to  not a substitute for  our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  We believe that Underlying Income performance is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to items such as special items, which can vary substantiallyfrom company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure.  Our management uses Underlying Income as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and language indicating trends, such as trend improvements, progress, anticipated, expected, improving sales trends and on track. It also includes financial information, of which, as of the date of this press release, the Companys independent auditors have not completed their review.   Although the Company believes that the assumptions upon which the financial information and its forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these assumptions will prove to be correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Companys projections and expectations are disclosed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These factors include, among others, changes in consumer preferences and product trends; price discounting by major competitors; failure to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from MillerCoors; failure to realize anticipated results from synergy initiatives; and increases in costs generally.  All forward-looking statements in this press release are expressly qualified by such cautionary statements and by reference to the underlying assumptions. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Reconciliation of Net Income attributable to MillerCoors to MCBC's Equity Income in MillerCoors and Reconciliation to U.S. Segment Underlying Pretax Income
Table 5:
 
(Note: Some numbers may not sum due to rounding.)
(1) MillerCoors made its initial accounting policy elections upon formation, impacting certain asset and liability balances.  These adjustments reflect the impact to our investment in MillerCoors, which is based upon our contributed assets and liabilities. These adjustments were concluded in the first quarter of 2009.
 
(2) MCBCs net investment in MillerCoors is based on the carrying values of the net assets it contributed to the joint venture.  MCBCs investment basis in MillerCoors is less than our underlying equity (42)% in the total net assets of MillerCoors (contributed by both Coors and Miller) by approximately $648.1 million.  This amount is being amortized over a period of time represented primarily by the remaining useful lives of long-lived assets giving rise to the difference.  For non-depreciable assets, such as goodwill, no adjustment will be recorded to the MillerCoors equity method income unless there is an impairment.
(3) The net adjustment is to record all stock-based compensation associated with preexisting equity awards to be settled in MCBC Class B common stock held by former CBC employees now employed by MillerCoors and eliminate all stock-based compensation impacts related to preexisting SABMiller equity awards held by Miller employees now employed by MillerCoors.  The adjustment is to recognize the additional 58% of the stock-based compensation costs associated with those awards recognized and reported by MCBC's U.S. business and eliminate all of the costs associated with equity awards to be settled in SABMiller equity.
 (4) MillerCoors Q1 2009 Special Items of $10.4 million, multiplied by MCBC's proportionate share of MillerCoors at 42%, equals $4.4 million.

(a) On December 29, 2008, we adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1,  ("FSP APB 14-1"). This FSP APB 14-1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Upon adopting FSP APB 14-1, the provisions were retroactively applied. As a result, $4.0 and $3.9 million of additional non-cash interest expense was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively.
