DENVER, Colo., and MONTREAL, Quebec  Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today reported double-digit income growth for the third quarter.  Net income attributable to Molson Coors increased 37.4 percent to $235.3 million for the third quarter, up from $171.3 million a year ago.  Underlying after-tax income increased 22.7 percent to $212.9 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, up from $173.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, a year ago.
(1)
Peter Swinburn, Molson Coors president and chief executive officer, said, Molson Coors had a successful third quarter, with underlying earnings up more than 22 percent versus a year ago.  This headline profit includes some non-operating and one-time noise, both positive and negative.  The positive resolution of tax positions in the quarter was partially offset by currency headwinds, a mark-to-market hedge loss this year, and the challenge of cycling supplier negotiation benefits last year.  Excluding these factors, earnings grew approximately 13 percent in the quarter.  These trading results reflect a high level of brand investment, coupled with cost control and price management.  Our results also reflect weak industry volume trends, continued cost inflation across our businesses, and more promotional pricing activity in Canada.  In terms of our portfolio performance, total-company volume in the third quarter declined, and worldwide Coors Light volumes were down slightly against a strong growth quarter a year ago.
We remain focused on building a diverse portfolio of extraordinary brands, offering value-enhancing innovations for consumers, and achieving positive pricing to grow our top-line and bottom-line as the economy improves.  We offer value to consumers in many forms, including innovative brands and promotional packaging, as well as category-leading advertising, retail promotions and service to our customers.  In the fourth quarter, incremental investments related to these efforts will be most significant in our Canada, U.S. and international businesses.  These investments are consistent with our brand-led global strategies, and we expect them to drive top-line and bottom-line growth as we move into 2010.
Third Quarter Highlights
 
Key operating and financial highlights for the Companys fiscal third quarter ended September 26, 2009, compared to the fiscal third quarter ended September 28, 2008, include the following:
 
 
1
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
The Companys effective tax rate during the third quarter 2009 for income from continuing operations was 9 percent on a reported basis and 4 percent on an underlying basis.  The Company estimates that its full-year 2009 underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of negative 2 percent to positive 2 percent.  These tax rates are significantly lower than the Companys anticipated long-term tax rate range of 22 percent to 26 percent due to the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions during 2009.
During the quarter, Molson Coors achieved an incremental $18 million of cost savings as part of its three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth (RFG) cost savings program.  Savings from the RFG program now total $246 million.
MillerCoors achieved $73 million in synergies in the third quarter, largely due to marketing synergies, as well as organizational savings resulting from the elimination of duplicate and transitional positions in the third quarter 2008.  Molson Coors 42 percent share of these synergies is $31 million.  Network optimization savings continue to be realized from shifting production of Coors and Miller brands into the larger MillerCoors brewery network, a process which will continue for the next nine months.  MillerCoors continues to integrate business processes and systems across the enterprise to deliver enhanced customer solutions and better leverage the scale of the business.
MillerCoors has delivered $183 million in synergies this year, bringing the total to $211 million since beginning operations on July 1, 2008.  The Company now expects to achieve $270 million of cumulative synergies by the end of 2009, surpassing its original commitment of $225 million.  As previously communicated, MillerCoors will deliver incremental cost savings above the $500 million synergy target, and approximately $200 million in cost savings are expected to be delivered by the end of 2012, approximately in-line with current market expectations.  These cost savings include efficiencies in production costs, procurement, and marketing, general and administrative expense.
Molson Coors Brewing Companys total worldwide beer volume was 13.8 million hectoliters in the quarter, 2.9 percent lower versus the prior year, as shown in Table 1 below.

Business Segments
Following are the Companys 2009 third quarter results by business segment:
Canada Business
Canada underlying pretax income in local currency declined 2 percent versus a year ago.  Positive net pricing and the benefit of cost savings initiatives were offset by declines in volume and higher marketing, general and administrative expenses, driven by increased brand investment and the deconsolidation of our interest in the Beer Stores in Ontario (Brewers Retail Inc.).  On a reported basis, Canada underlying pretax income was $139.3 million in the third quarter, 7.7 percent lower than a year ago, as the Canadian Dollar declined versus the U.S. Dollar approximately 6 percent, or $9 million, in the quarter.
Canada sales-to-retail (STRs) decreased 3.2 percent in the third quarter versus last year.  Coors Light continued to show growth, while Molson Canadian and Molson Export declined versus prior year.  Canada beer industry volumes decreased an estimated 0.7 percent in the quarter.
Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters, down 1.8 percent from a year ago.  Comparable net sales per hectoliter increased 2 percent in local currency, driven by favorable net pricing, led by price increases across all major markets, partially offset by continued price discounting activity.
(2)
Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased slightly on a comparable basis in local currency.  An increase in commodity, packaging material, distribution and other input costs, including pension expense, as well as fixed cost deleverage related to lower export volume to the U.S., were offset by savings from our Resources for Growth initiatives.
Comparable marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 4.4 percent in local currency, driven by higher brand and innovation investments.

Molson Coors Brewing Company
United States Business (MillerCoors)
(3)
Molson Coors underlying U.S. segment pretax income grew 16.6 percent to $107.4 million in the third quarter due to strong underlying income growth by MillerCoors.  Strong MillerCoors income growth was partially offset by cycling high equity income last year and one day of income for the legacy Coors business prior to the formation of MillerCoors on July 1, 2008.
MillerCoors Operating and Financial Highlights (U.S. GAAP)
For the quarter, underlying net income attributable to MillerCoors, excluding special items, increased 28.1 percent to $244.4 million versus the prior-year comparable quarter.  MillerCoors is successfully delivering synergies, controlling costs, and managing revenue for sustainable profit growth, despite continuing commodity cost pressures.
MillerCoors domestic sales-to-retailers (STRs) were down 1.3 percent due to a slight decline in premium light volumes and continued softness in above premium and premium brands.  Domestic sales-to-wholesalers (STWs) fell 0.7 percent primarily driven by lower retail sales.
MillerCoors total net revenue increased 3.1 percent to $2.01 billion versus the prior-year comparable quarter, driven by domestic net pricing.  Excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, net sales revenue increased 3.0 percent to $1.87 billion.  Third-party contract brewing volumes declined 4.6 percent, though profits were up slightly from the prior-year comparable quarter.
Pricing remained strong in the third quarter, as domestic net revenue per barrel, excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 3.7 percent, driven by sustained price increases taken in the fall of 2008 and reductions in discount activity.
Cost of goods sold per barrel increased 3.5 percent as benefits from MillerCoors cost leadership programs were more than offset by brewing and packaging material cost increases under procurement contracts largely arranged prior to more recent commodity market price reductions.
Marketing, general and administrative costs decreased 4.5 percent, driven primarily by lower organizational costs and synergies, which were partially offset by IT integration-related expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for MillerCoors in the third quarter were $72.9 million and additions to tangible and intangible assets totaled $79.5 million.
United Kingdom Business
U.K. underlying pretax earnings in local currency increased more than 20 percent versus a year ago.  This increase was driven by positive results from the strategic actions our U.K. team has taken in the past year, including leveraging our contract brewing arrangement and brand building efforts, allowing us to forgo low-margin volume.  The benefit of these actions was partially offset by the one-time impact of a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges and cycling a one-time supplier negotiation benefit of $6 million in 2008, combined with lower volume and higher marketing, general and administration expenses in the quarter.  On a reported basis, third quarter U.K. underlying pretax income was $32.7 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 6.5 percent, versus the same quarter last year.  These results include the impact of a 13 percent devaluation of the British Pound versus the U.S. Dollar, which reduced U.K. earnings by $5 million in the quarter.
 
4
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company
U.K. owned-brand volume decreased 6.3 percent during the quarter due to declining industry volume and the Companys strategy to forgo low-margin volume.  The U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 1 percent in the third quarter.
Comparable net sales per hectoliter of owned products increased 21 percent in local currency, driven by two factors.  Higher pricing in all channels and positive sales mix drove 17 percent and 4 percent of the increase, respectively.
Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of owned brands increased 22 percent in local currency in the third quarter, driven by cycling the one-time supplier negotiation benefit in 2008, input cost inflation, adverse brand and channel mix, a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges, and the deleveraging impact of lower owned-brand volumes.
Marketing, general and administrative expense increased 7.8 percent in local currency due to higher marketing, incentive compensation, and bad debt expenses in the quarter, along with sales-related costs in our new Cobra business.
International Markets and Corporate
The underlying pretax loss for International Markets and Corporate was $57.5 million, a 7.1 percent increase versus the third quarter of 2008.
The Companys International Markets business grew volume nearly 28 percent, on a small base, driven by the strength of Coors Light in China and Carling in Europe.  Marketing, general and administrative expense for International Markets was $12.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.1 million versus a year ago.
Corporate general and administrative expense was $28.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of $7.7 million, driven by higher incentive compensation, project spending, and labor-related costs this year.
Corporate net interest expense was $24.7 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $3.7 million compared to a year ago, with approximately $2.7 million of this reduction attributable to the deconsolidation of BRI and the balance due to foreign currency movements.  In the quarter, Corporate other income of $58.2 million was driven by a one-time mark-to-market gain related to the Fosters cash-settled total-return swap.

Molson Coors Brewing Company
 
Special and Other One-Time Items
During the third quarter 2009, the Company reported net special charges of $4.3 million pretax, which was composed primarily of $3.5 million of non-cash expenses associated with closing the Edmonton Brewery.
Other one-time items in the quarter included a $59.3 million non-cash mark-to-market gain in Corporate other income related to the cash-settled total-return swap the Company arranged with respect to Fosters common stock in 2008.
During the third quarter of 2009, MillerCoors reported special charges totaling $14.7 million, which include pension curtailment and integration expenses.  This equates to $6.2 million at Molson Coors 42 percent economic ownership share.
The foregoing special and other one-time items have been excluded from underlying earnings in the third quarter 2009.
The companys underlying results were reduced by other non-operating or unusual factors, including unfavorable year-over-year currency movements, a mark-to-market hedge loss this year and supplier negotiation benefits last year in the U.K.  These headwinds totaled $22.3 million pretax in the 3 quarter. 
rd
Meanwhile, results in the quarter benefited from the favorable resolution of some unrecognized tax positions, which increased $36.4 million from a year ago.
 
Discontinued Operations
The Company reports results associated with its former Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser (Kaiser), as discontinued operations.  The Company reported a loss of $9.0 million from discontinued operations during the quarter due to legal expenses and losses from foreign exchange, which were partially offset by reductions in liabilities.

Pretax and after-tax underlying income should be viewed as a supplement to  not a substitute for  our results of operations presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  We believe that underlying income performance is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to evaluate our performance without regard to items such as special items, which can vary substantiallyfrom company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure.  Our management uses underlying income as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.

(Note: Some numbers may not sum due to rounding.)
 
Notes:
MillerCoors made its initial accounting policy elections upon formation, impacting certain asset and liability balances.  These adjustments reflect the impact to our investment in MillerCoors, which is based upon our contributed assets and liabilities.
(1)
MCBCs net investment in MillerCoors is based on the carrying values of the net assets it contributed to the joint venture.  MCBCs investment basis in MillerCoors is less than our underlying equity (42%) in the total net assets of MillerCoors (contributed by both Coors and Miller) by approximately $633.4 million.  This amount is being amortized over a period of time represented primarily by the remaining useful lives of long-lived assets giving rise to the difference.  For non-depreciable assets, such as goodwill, no adjustment will be recorded to the MillerCoors equity method income unless there is an impairment.
(2)
The net adjustment is to record all stock-based compensation associated with preexisting equity awards to be settled in MCBC Class B common stock held by former CBC employees now employed by MillerCoors and eliminate all stock-based compensation impacts related to preexisting SABMiller equity awards held by Miller employees now employed by MillerCoors.  The adjustment is to recognize the additional 58% of the stock-based compensation costs associated with those awards recognized and reported by MCBC's U.S. business and eliminate all of the costs associated with equity awards to be settled in SABMiller equity.
(3)
MillerCoors Q3 2009 Special Items of $14.7 million, multiplied by MCBC's proportionate share of MillerCoors at 42%, equals $6.2 million. MillerCoors Q3 2008 Special Items of $22.6 million, multiplied by MCBC's proportionate share of MillerCoors at 42%, equals $9.5 million.

Included in Equity Income in MillerCoors.  This adjustment represents the fair value mark to market component of MCBC share-based compensation held by employees of MillerCoors.

Notes:
On December 29, 2008, we adopted guidance regarding accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) that applies to all convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature, which means that such convertible debt instruments, by their terms, may be settled either wholly or partially in cash upon conversion. This guidance requires issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner reflective of the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The provisions of this guidance were retroactively applied.  As a result, $4.0 million and $11.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense was recorded in the third quarter and first thirty-nine weeks of 2008, respectively.  During the third quarter and first thirty-nine weeks of 2009, we recorded $4.1 million and $12.2 million of additional non-cash interest expense, respectively.

On December 29, 2008, MCBC adopted guidance regarding accounting for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the provisions of which, among others, require that minority interests be renamed noncontrolling interests and that consolidated net income (loss) includes the amounts attributable to such noncontrolling interests for all periods presented.
