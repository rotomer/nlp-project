Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") intends to offer up to Cdn$500 million of senior notes due 2017 to certain Canadian accredited investors on a private placement basis.  The notes are expected to be issued by a subsidiary of the Company and would be pari pasu with the Company's other outstanding notes and its credit facility.  The Company expects to use the proceeds to refinance a portion of its current debt and for general corporate purposes which may, in part, include payments to fund pension obligations. The offering is subject to market and other customary conditions.  There can be no assurances that the private placement will be consummated.
 
The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.  This filing shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor shall there be any sale of the securities mentioned in this filing in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
