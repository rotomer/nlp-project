On October 6, 2010, Molson Coors International LP (the "Issuer"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company"), issued CAD $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Series A Notes due 2017 (the "Notes").  The Notes are guaranteed by the Company and by each of Coors Brewing Company, Molson Canada 2005, CBC Holdco, Inc., Coors International Holdco ULC, Molson Coors Callco ULC, Molson Coors International General ULC, and Molson Coors Capital Finance ULC (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors").
 
The Notes were issued by the Issuer pursuant to an indenture, dated as of October 6, 2010, among the Issuer, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the "Trustee"), as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture thereto dated October 6, 2010 (the "Indenture"). Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Notes are unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer with right to payment under the Notes equal in right of payment with any of the Issuer's current unsecured indebtedness. The Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 3.95%, which will be payable on April 6 and October 6 of each year (to holders of record on the immediately preceding April 1 and October 1 of each year), commencing on April 6, 2011.
 
The Indenture provides that the Issuer may redeem the Notes at its option in whole or in part at any time at the Issuer's option, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture contains covenants which, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the ability of the Issuer, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur secured indebtedness and enter into certain sale/leaseback transactions. The Indenture contains customary events of default.
