On March 4, 2011 the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") approved the participants and determined the targets and performance criteria, for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, under the Company's Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011, to be paid in 2012. The approved performance measures are pre-tax income (for those with corporate responsibilities or business unit responsibility in the UK and Canada), earnings before interest, taxes and amortization and market share growth (for certain employees with responsibility for the MillerCoors joint venture), and pre-tax income and volume (for those with responsibility for Molson Coors International). In addition, the Compensation Committee approved earnings per share growth as the performance criterion to be applied to the performance units for the 2011-2014 performance period under the long-term equity compensation component of the Plan.
