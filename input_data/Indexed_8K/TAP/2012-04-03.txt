Any such payments shall include Default Interest from the date any such

Alternate Rate of Interest

(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans as Eurocurrency Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Borrowing Request that requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective and
 
the applicable Borrower may instead request an ABR Borrowing not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing and (ii) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion or continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in US Dollars, as an ABR Borrowing, or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in Euro, as a Borrowing bearing interest at such rate as the Lenders and the Company may agree adequately reflects the costs to the Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans (or, in the absence of such agreement, shall be repaid as of the last day of the current Interest Period applicable thereto).

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay or cause the Additional Borrower to pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), other than any Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, then from time to time the Company will pay or cause the Additional Borrower to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company will pay or cause the Additional Borrower to pay to such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that neither the Company nor the Additional Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such
provided
 
increased costs or reductions and delivers a certificate with respect thereto as provided in paragraph (c) above; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly inform the applicable Borrower of the contents thereof) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments

SECTION 2.16. (a) Subject to all the provisions of this Section 2.16 and except as required by law, any and all payments by or on account of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes
.
provided
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes (not otherwise addressed in Section 2.16(a)) to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (except to the extent such penalties, interest or costs are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct by a Lender or the Administrative Agent), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall give the Company written notice of
 
any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to be made hereunder with respect to which the Company has an indemnity obligation, but the failure of such Lender or Administrative Agent to give such notice shall not limit its right to receive indemnification hereunder, except that a failure to give such notice will constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of the first sentence of this clause (c) to the extent penalties, interest or costs are incurred solely as a result of the failure to give such notice. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in seeking a refund or return of such payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that claims to be entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower to whom a Lender has made a Loan is organized or resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, or any other jurisdiction with respect to which the Administrative Agent or Lender receives written notice of such exemption from the Company with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Such documentation shall include, as applicable and without limitation, (x) properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY (including the appropriate attachments thereto) or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case claiming complete exemption from United States withholding tax along with any other documentation required by applicable law, (y) where claiming exemption under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, a statement signed under penalty of perjury that such Person is not (1) a "bank" as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10% shareholder of the Company (within the meaning if Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) or (3) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Company or any Loan Party within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code, together with a properly completed U.S. Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and (z) a properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. In addition, if a payment made to the Administrative Agent or Lender under this Agreement or in respect of any Obligation of a Borrower would be subject to United States withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Person were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable) and such Person is claiming or seeking to claim an exemption from withholding under FATCA, such Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Person has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Borrower from any penalties, interest or other costs incurred by such Borrower solely as a result of the failure of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to comply properly with such documentation requirements.
 
(f) The Administrative Agent or each Lender, on the date it becomes the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder (or designates a new lending office), will designate lending offices for the Loans to be made and held by it, and represents and warrants that, on such date (but without giving effect to any Change in Law after the date hereof), it will not be liable and the relevant Borrower will not be required to withhold or deduct for any withholding tax that is imposed by the United States of America on payments by such Borrower except if such Lender (or assignor, if any) was, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law (and would have been able to comply on the date that the applicable Lender or assignor became a Lender hereunder). The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall provide documentation to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.16(e)) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company to establish the foregoing. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender is unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law described above, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall provide the Company with (i) adequate information as will permit the Company to determine the applicable rate of withholding tax and (ii) any additional properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Company which is necessary to make such withholding on a payment made hereunder. The Administrative Agent or each Lender shall indemnify the relevant Borrower for the full amount of Excluded Taxes paid or required to be paid by such Borrower on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder or under any Loan Document as a result of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's failure to comply with this Section 2.16(f).
(g) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent (each a "") receives a refund or credit in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.16 and, in the case of a credit, such credit reduces the Tax liability of the Finance Party and is in the good faith opinion of the relevant Finance Party both identifiable and quantifiable without requiring such Finance Party or its professional advisers to expend a material amount of time or incur a material cost in so identifying or quantifying, the Finance Party will pay over the amount of such refund or credit to the relevant Borrower to the extent the Finance Party has received indemnity payments or additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit); , that the relevant Borrower, upon the request of the Finance Party, agrees to repay the amount it received to the Finance Party within 30 days of such request, plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority (except to the extent such penalties or other charges are incurred solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the relevant Finance Party), if the refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or cancelled. Amounts payable to a Borrower under this clause (g) with respect to a refund received by a Finance Party will be paid to the relevant Borrower within 30 days of receipt of such refund by the Finance Party. Amounts payable under this clause (g) with respect to a credit realized by a Finance Party will be paid within 30 days of the determination by the Finance Party that the credit reduced the Tax liability of such Finance Party.
Finance Party

(i) This Section 2.16 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
 
SECTION 2.17. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time (unless a different time is specified under a particular provision hereof or thereof), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account specified in Schedule 2.17 or, in any such case, to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify reasonably in advance of the date of the required payment in a notice delivered to the Company; that such payments shall be subject to the principles of Section 2.16(f) (substituting "Administrative Agent" for "Lender" and "account" for "lending offices"). The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any Lender or other Person promptly following receipt thereof to the appropriate lending office or other address specified by such Lender or other Person. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Administrative Agent to make such payment.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
.
provided
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Loans, resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective Loans and accrued interest thereon; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
 
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry practices on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by it for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Administrative Agent until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any amendment or waiver of any Loan Document that requires the consent of all Lenders (or of each affected Lender, where such Lender is an affected Lender) and such amendment or waiver is consented to by the Required Lenders, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, but with the cooperation of the Administrative Agent, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender (a "") to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent if such consent would be required under Section 10.04(b), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such

compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Replaced Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within one (1) Business Day of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Replaced Lender, then such Replaced Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Replaced Lender.
SECTION 2.19. . Prior to the Closing Date the Company may designate any Lux Subsidiary as the Additional Borrower by delivery to the Administrative Agent of the Additional Borrower Agreement executed by such Lux Subsidiary and the Company, and upon such delivery, and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.03, such Lux Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be the Additional Borrower and a party to this Agreement. As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Additional Borrower Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall send a copy thereof to each Lender.
Designation of Additional Borrower
SECTION 2.20. . (a) If and so long as any Lender is required to make special deposits with the Bank of England, to maintain reserve asset ratios or to pay fees, in each case in respect of such Lender's Loans, such Lender may require the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loans at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in Exhibit E hereto.
Additional Reserve Costs
(b) If and so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other authority (including any such requirement imposed by the European Central Bank or the European System of Central Banks, but excluding requirements reflected in the Mandatory Costs Rate) in respect of any of such Lender's Loans, such Lender may require the relevant Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Loans subject to such requirements, additional interest on such Loans at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Loans.
(c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the relevant Lender, acting in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the relevant Loans, and such additional interest so notified to the relevant Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loans.
SECTION 2.21. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders

(a) Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue from and after the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender on the undrawn portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
(b) [Intentionally Omitted];
 
(c) the outstanding Commitment and Loans, if any, of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action under this Agreement (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification pursuant to Section 10.02), that any amendment, waiver or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders or that would (i) change the percentage of Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders, that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (ii) amend this Section 2.21 or Section 10.02 in a manner which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other Lenders and is adverse to such Defaulting Lender, (iii) increase or extend the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender or subject such Defaulting Lender to any additional obligations (it being understood that any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute an increase or extension of the Commitment of any Lender or an additional obligation of any Lender), (iv) reduce the principal of the Loans made by such Defaulting Lender or (v) postpone the scheduled date for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans made by such Defaulting Lender, shall in each case require the consent of such Defaulting Lender (which consent shall be deemed to have been given if such Defaulting Lender fails to respond to a written request for such consent within 30 days after receipt of such written request);
provided
(d) [Intentionally Omitted];
(e) [Intentionally Omitted];

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to a Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Section (other than subclause (vii) of such clause (i)), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Company, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans to be due and payable in whole or in part (in which case any principal amount not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest on the Loans and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately (except as provided above), without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower; , , that (notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document) the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders shall not be permitted to take any such action pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above during the Certain Funds Period unless an Event of Default which is a Certain Funds Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and in case of any event described in clause (h) or (i) of this Section with respect to a Borrower, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower.
provided
however
 
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the Additional Borrower hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Additional Borrower. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Additional Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of
 
any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against the Additional Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by the Additional Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, DBNY is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders, each assignee of any Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Company of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Company or any other Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement in the event that all the capital stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
With respect to the Loans made by it under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own
 
securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties under the Loan Documents shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise upon receipt of notice in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
provided
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and in good faith believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
In taking any discretionary action hereunder, or in determining whether any provision hereof is applicable to any event, transaction or circumstance, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be required (unless required by any other express provision hereof) to, communicate such proposed action or determination to the Lenders prior to taking or making the same, and shall be entitled (subject to any otherwise applicable requirement of Section 10.02(b)), in the absence of any contrary communication received from any Lender within a reasonable period of time specified in such communication from the Administrative Agent, to assume that such proposed action or determination is satisfactory to such Lender.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Company shall have the right, with the consent of the Required Lenders (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor; , that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Lenders, and not the Company, shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint such successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Company (or, if applicable, the Required Lenders) and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after written demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against such Administrative Agent by the United States Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of
 
the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective) unless such failure was due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Article. The agreements in this Article shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as an Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the applicable Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent) allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent. Nothing herein shall be deemed to give the Administrative Agent the right to vote the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding pursuant to such Debtor Relief Law.

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

Successors and Assigns

obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Loans and Commitments are intended to be treated as registered obligations for tax purposes and the right, title and interest of the Lenders in and to such Loans and Commitments shall be transferable only in accordance with the terms hereof. This Section 10.04(c) shall be construed so that the Loans and Commitments are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.
(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.

To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the ""). No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to the Borrowers or any other Person (including the existence or identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement) except (i) to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loans or other obligations are in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the applicable United States Treasury Regulations or (ii) with respect to any Person whose interest in the Obligations is treated as a participation by reason of the penultimate sentence of Section 10.04(b).

A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with and be subject to Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.
(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall be deemed to utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by the Granting Bank and such Granting Bank shall for all purposes remain the Lender of record hereunder. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which

In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.04 other than Section 10.04(d), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (if consented to by the Company and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans (but not relating to any Borrower, except with the Company's consent) to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

"" has the meaning ascribed to it for the purposes of, and shall be calculated in accordance with, the Fees Regulations.
Fee Base
"" means, as appropriate, either: (a) the Banking Supervision (Fees) Regulations 1998; or (b) such regulations as from time to time may be in force, relating to the payment of fees for banking supervision in respect of periods subsequent to January 1, 2000.

"" means the Financial Services Authority. Any reference to a provision of any statute, directive, order or regulation herein is a reference to that provision as amended or re-enacted from time to time.
FSA
2. Calculation of the Mandatory Costs Rate. The Mandatory Costs Rate is an addition to the interest rate on each Eurocurrency Loan or any other sum on which interest is to be calculated to compensate the Lenders for the cost attributable to Eurocurrency Loan or such sum resulting from the imposition from time to time under or pursuant to the Act and/or by the Bank of England, the FSA (or other United Kingdom governmental authorities or agencies) or the European Central Bank of a requirement to place non-interest bearing or Special Deposits (whether interest bearing or not) with the Bank of England and/or pay fees to the FSA calculated by reference to the liabilities used to fund the relevant Eurocurrency Loan or such sum.
The "" will be the rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be equal to the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) resulting from the application of the following formula:
Mandatory Costs Rate
For Sterling:
XL + S(L-D) + F x 0.01
100-(X + S)
For other Foreign Currencies:
F x 0.01
300
where on the day of application of the formula
 
X is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (in excess of any stated minimum) by reference to which Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) is required under or pursuant to the Act to maintain cash ratio deposits with the Bank of England;
L is the rate of interest (exclusive of Applicable Rate and Mandatory Costs Rate) payable on that day on the related Eurocurrency Loan or unpaid sum pursuant to this Agreement;
F is the rate of charge payable by Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) to the FSA pursuant to the Fees Regulations and expressed in pounds per 1 million of the Fees Base of such Reference Lender;
S is the level of interest-bearing Special Deposits, expressed as a percentage of Eligible Liabilities, which Deutsche Bank AG, Canada Branch is required to maintain by the Bank of England (or other United Kingdom governmental authorities or agencies); and
D is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) on Special Deposits.
(X, L, S and D are to be expressed in the formula as numbers and not as percentages. A negative result obtained from subtracting D from L shall be counted as zero.)
The Mandatory Costs Rate attributable to a Eurocurrency Loan or other sum for any period shall be calculated at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the first day of such period for the duration of such period.
The determination of Mandatory Costs Rate by the Administrative Agent in relation to any period shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
3. Change of Requirements
If there is any change in circumstance (including the imposition of alternative or additional requirements) which in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent renders or will render the above formula (or any element thereof, or any defined term used therein) inappropriate or inapplicable, the Administrative Agent shall (with the written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) be entitled to vary the same. Any such variation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties and shall apply from the date specified in such notice.

The Lenders have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Lenders to extend such credit are conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of the Guarantors (as defined below) is a Subsidiary of the Company, will derive substantial benefits from the extension of credit to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to extend such credit.

(a) (i) Each Guarantor (other than any Lux Guarantor) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of all the Obligations; and
(ii) each Lux Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Lux Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Additional Borrower.
(b) Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Without prejudice to the Borrowers' rights to receive demands for payment in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
 
SECTION 3. . Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment
SECTION 4. .
No Limitations, Etc
(a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 20, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been fully paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
SECTION 5. . Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
 
SECTION 6. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and Lenders.
Agreement to Pay; Indemnity: Subrogation: Contribution
Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.

Company
Administrative Agent
Reference is made to the Term Loan Agreement dated as of April 3, 2012 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the ""), among the Company, the Lenders from time to time party thereto and the Administrative Agent. The Lenders have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Lenders to extend such credit are conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of the Guarantors (as defined below) is a Subsidiary of the Company, will derive substantial benefits from the extension of credit to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to extend such credit. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Credit Agreement
SECTION 1.
Definitions.
(a) Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement.
(b) The rules of construction specified in Section 1.03 of the Credit Agreement also apply to this Agreement.

"" means (a) the Subsidiaries identified on Schedule I hereto and (b) each other Subsidiary that becomes a party to this Agreement as a Guarantor after the Effective Date.
Guarantors

Lux Guarantor
SECTION 2. Guarantee.
(a) (i) Each Guarantor (other than any Lux Guarantor) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of all the Obligations; and
(ii) each Lux Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other Lux Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the Additional Borrower.
(b) Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Without prejudice to the Borrowers' rights to receive demands for
payment in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
SECTION 3. . Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment
SECTION 4. .
No Limitations, Etc
(a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 20, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been fully paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
 
SECTION 5. . Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
SECTION 6. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and Lenders.
Agreement to Pay; Indemnity: Subrogation: Contribution
Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.
Contributing Guarantor
Claiming Guarantor
 
SECTION 7. .

SECTION 10. ; . This Agreement shall become effective as to any Guarantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such Guarantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Guarantor shall have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement.

Subject to Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement, all payments by each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be made without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (and the Administrative Agent and each Guarantor hereby agree to comply with the provisions of Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement as if said Section referred to this Agreement and payments by such Guarantor hereunder).

(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan under Section 2.10(a) prior to the Maturity Date), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
provided
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
SECTION 2.13. If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans as Eurodollar Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Borrowing Request that requests a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and the Borrower may instead request an ABR Borrowing not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing and (ii) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion or continuation of any Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as an ABR Borrowing.
SECTION 2.14. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs.
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition or Tax affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender, other than any Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), other than any Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
 
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and delivers a certificate with respect thereto as provided in paragraph (c) above; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
provided further
SECTION 2.15. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan to a Loan of a different Type or Interest Period other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.08(c) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment or deemed assignment of any Eurodollar Loan or the right to receive payment other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18 then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense actually incurred and attributable to such event but excluding loss of anticipated profits. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly inform the Borrower of the contents thereof) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments.
SECTION 2.16. (a) Subject to all the provisions of this Section 2.16 and except as required by law, any and all payments by or on account of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes; that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes (not otherwise addressed in Section 2.16(a)) to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to
 
any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (except to the extent such penalties, interest or costs are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct by a Lender or the Administrative Agent), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower written notice of any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to be made hereunder with respect to which the Borrower has an indemnity obligation, but the failure of such Lender or Administrative Agent to give such notice shall not limit its right to receive indemnification hereunder, except that a failure to give such notice will constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of the first sentence of this clause (c) to the extent penalties, interest or costs are incurred solely as a result of the failure to give such notice. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in seeking a refund or return of such payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that claims to be entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower to whom a Lender has made a Loan is organized or resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, or any other jurisdiction with respect to which the Administrative Agent or Lender receives written notice of such exemption from the Borrower with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Such documentation shall include, as applicable and without limitation, (x) properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY (including the appropriate attachments thereto) or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case claiming complete exemption from United States withholding tax along with any other documentation required by applicable law, (y) where claiming exemption under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, a statement signed under penalty of perjury that such Person is not (1) a "bank" as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10% shareholder of the Borrower (within the meaning if Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) or (3) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower or any Loan Party within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code, together with a properly completed U.S. Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and (z) a properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. In addition, if a payment made to the Administrative Agent or Lender under this Agreement or in respect of any Obligation of the Borrower would be subject to United States withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Person were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable) and such Person is claiming or seeking to claim an exemption from withholding under FATCA, such Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably
 
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Person has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Such Lender or Administrative Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Borrower from any penalties, interest or other costs incurred by the Borrower solely as a result of the failure of such Lender or the Administrative Agent to comply properly with such documentation requirements.
(f) The Administrative Agent or each Lender, on the date it becomes the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder (or designates a new lending office), will designate lending offices for the Loans to be made and held by it, and represents and warrants that, on such date (but without giving effect to any Change in Law after the date hereof), it will not be liable and the Borrower will not be required to withhold or deduct for any withholding tax that is imposed by the United States of America on payments by the Borrower except if such Lender (or assignor, if any) was, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law (and would have been able to comply on the date that the applicable Lender or assignor became a Lender hereunder). The Administrative Agent and each Lender shall provide documentation to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.16(e)) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish the foregoing. If the Administrative Agent or a Lender is unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law described above, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall provide the Borrower with (i) adequate information as will permit the Borrower to determine the applicable rate of withholding tax and (ii) any additional properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower which is necessary to make such withholding on a payment made hereunder. The Administrative Agent or each Lender shall indemnify the Borrower for the full amount of Excluded Taxes paid or required to be paid by the Borrower on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any Loan Document as a result of the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's failure to comply with this Section 2.16(f).
(g) If a Lender or the Administrative Agent (each a "") receives a refund or credit in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.16 and, in the case of a credit, such credit reduces the Tax liability of the Finance Party and is in the good faith opinion of the relevant Finance Party both identifiable and quantifiable without requiring such Finance Party or its professional advisers to expend a material amount of time or incur a material cost in so identifying or quantifying, the Finance Party will pay over the amount of such refund or credit to the Borrower to the extent the Finance Party has received indemnity payments or additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit); , that the Borrower, upon the request of the Finance Party, agrees to repay the amount it received to the Finance Party within 30 days of such request, plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority (except to the extent such penalties or other charges are incurred solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the relevant Finance Party), if the refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or cancelled. Amounts payable to the Borrower under this clause (g) with respect to a refund received by a Finance Party will be paid to the Borrower within 30 days of receipt of such refund by the Finance Party. Amounts payable under this clause (g) with respect to a credit realized by a Finance Party will be paid within 30 days of the determination by the Finance Party that the credit reduced the Tax liability of such Finance Party.

(h) [Intentionally Omitted].
(i) This Section 2.16 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 2.17. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time (unless a different time is specified under a particular provision hereof or thereof), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account specified in Schedule 2.17 or, in any such case, to such other account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify reasonably in advance of the date of the required payment in a notice delivered to the Borrower; that such payments shall be subject to the principles of Section 2.16(f) (substituting "Administrative Agent" for "Lender" and "account" for "lending offices"). The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any Lender or other Person promptly following receipt thereof to the appropriate lending office or other address specified by such Lender or other Person. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Administrative Agent to make such payment.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
provided
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from the Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Loans, resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective Loans and accrued interest thereon; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
provided
 
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry practices on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by it for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Administrative Agent until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 2.16, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to any amendment or waiver of any Loan Document that requires the consent of all Lenders (or of each affected Lender, where such Lender is an affected Lender) and such amendment or waiver is consented to by the Required Lenders, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, but with the cooperation of the Administrative Agent, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender (a "") to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i)
Replaced Lender
provided
 
the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent if such consent would be required under Section 10.04(b), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Replaced Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within one (1) Business Day of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Replaced Lender, then such Replaced Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Replaced Lender.
SECTION 2.19. [Intentionally Omitted].
SECTION 2.20. [Intentionally Omitted].
SECTION 2.21. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders.
(a) Commitment Fees shall cease to accrue from and after the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender on the undrawn portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a);
(b) [Intentionally Omitted];
(c) the outstanding Commitment and Loans, if any, of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action under this Agreement (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification pursuant to Section 10.02), that any amendment, waiver or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other affected Lenders or that would (i) change the percentage of Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders, that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (ii) amend this Section 2.21 or Section 10.02 in a manner which affects such Defaulting Lender differently than other Lenders and is adverse to such Defaulting Lender, (iii) increase or extend the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender or subject such Defaulting Lender to any additional obligations (it being understood that any amendment, waiver or consent in respect of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or Events of Default shall not constitute an increase or extension of the Commitment of any Lender or an additional obligation of any Lender), (iv) reduce the principal of the Loans made by such Defaulting Lender or (v) postpone the scheduled date for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans made by such Defaulting Lender, shall in each case require the consent of such Defaulting Lender (which consent shall be deemed to have been given if such Defaulting Lender fails to respond to a written request for such consent within 30 days after receipt of such written request);
provided
 
(d) [Intentionally Omitted];
(e) [Intentionally Omitted];
(f) in the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agree (acting reasonably) that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Defaulting Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Defaulting Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its share of the outstanding Commitments at the time;
(g) the operation of any provision of this Section 2.21, will not (i) constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender, or (except with respect to clause (f) above) cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender, or (ii) except as expressly provided in this Section 2.21, excuse or otherwise modify the performance by the Borrower of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and
(h) anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may (i) require such Lender to assign and delegate all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents in accordance with Section 2.18(b) or (ii) terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender on a non-pro rata basis upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
provided
The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders, as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date (but subject to Section 4.03 and Section 7.01), that:

SECTION 7.02. [Intentionally Omitted].
SECTION 7.03. [Intentionally Omitted].
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders, each assignee of any Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement in the event that all the capital stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person other than the Borrower or an Affiliate of the Borrower in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
 
With respect to the Loans made by it under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties under the Loan Documents shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise upon receipt of notice in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
provided
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and in good faith believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
 
of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
In taking any discretionary action hereunder, or in determining whether any provision hereof is applicable to any event, transaction or circumstance, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be required (unless required by any other express provision hereof) to, communicate such proposed action or determination to the Lenders prior to taking or making the same, and shall be entitled (subject to any otherwise applicable requirement of Section 10.02(b)), in the absence of any contrary communication received from any Lender within a reasonable period of time specified in such communication from the Administrative Agent, to assume that such proposed action or determination is satisfactory to such Lender.
The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Borrower shall have the right, with the consent of the Required Lenders (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor; , that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Lenders, and not the Borrower, shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint such successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Borrower (or, if applicable, the Required Lenders) and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. If neither the Borrower (or, if applicable, the Required Lenders) nor the Administrative Agent have appointed a successor Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall be deemed to have succeeded to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
 
To the extent required by any applicable law, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after written demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against such Administrative Agent by the United States Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective) unless such failure was due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Article. The agreements in this Article shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as an Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent) allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent. Nothing herein shall be deemed to give the Administrative Agent the right to vote the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding pursuant to such Debtor Relief Law.
 
SECTION 10.01. (a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and subject to paragraph (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments.
 
(b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders (subject to clause (c) below) or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that, no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that the waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such Lender), (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, or reduce the Applicable Rate, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount, (iii) postpone the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such scheduled payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount or which holds such Commitment, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, or amend the pro rata treatment of each reduction of the Commitments under Section 2.08, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or reduce the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, or (vi) release all or substantially all the Subsidiary Guarantors from its or their obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, without the written consent of each Lender; that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

This Section 10.04(c) shall be construed so that the Loans and Commitments are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.

Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender entitled to such benefits and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, but only to the extent that such Participant agrees to comply with and be subject to Section 2.16 as if it were a Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Bank makes such payment.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.04 other than Section 10.04(d), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to its Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (if consented to by the Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit facilities to or for the account of such SPC to fund the Loans made by such SPC or to support the securities (if any) issued by such SPC to fund such Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans (but not relating to the Borrower, except with the Borrower's consent) to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by the Borrower or Guarantor to the Administrative Agent and Lenders.

(f) Upon acceptance of a B/A by a Lender, such Lender shall purchase such B/A from the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary at the Discount Rate for such Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as provided in Section 2.06. The acceptance fee payable by the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary to a Lender under Section 2.11 in respect of each B/A accepted by such Lender shall be set off against the Discount Proceeds payable by such Lender under this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any B/A Drawing resulting from the conversion or continuation of a B/A Drawing or Global Tranche Loan pursuant to Section 2.07, the net amount that would otherwise be payable to such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary by each Lender pursuant to this paragraph will be applied as provided in Section 2.07(e).
(g) Each Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/A's accepted and purchased by it (it being understood that no such sale, rediscount or disposition shall constitute an assignment or participation of any Commitment hereunder).
(h) Each B/A accepted and purchased hereunder shall mature at the end of the Contract Period applicable thereto.
(i) Subject to applicable law, each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Lender in respect of a B/A accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Lender in its own right and each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Lender as holder sues such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary on the B/A for payment of the amounts payable by such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall pay the Lender that has accepted and purchased such B/A the full face amount of such B/A, and after such payment such Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.
(j) At the option of each Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary and any Global Tranche Lender, B/As under this Agreement to be accepted by that Lender may be issued in the form of depository bills for deposit with The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited pursuant to the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All depository bills so issued shall be governed by the provisions of this Section 2.05.
(k) If a Global Tranche Lender is not a chartered bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Global Tranche Lender notifies the Canadian Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept B/As, such Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing B/As, make a Loan (a "") to the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the amount and for the same term as each draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Lender will provide to the Canadian Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary in the same manner as such Lender would have provided the Discount
B/A Equivalent Loan
 
Proceeds in respect of the draft which such Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would result if such Lender had accepted (and been paid an acceptance fee) and purchased (on a discounted basis) a B/A for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Lenders and the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary as the B/A that such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and will be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan in the same manner in which the Discount Proceeds of a B/A would be deducted from the face amount of the B/A. Subject to the repayment requirements of this Agreement, on the last day of the relevant Contract Period for such B/A Equivalent Loan, the applicable Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary shall be entitled to convert each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another type of Loan, or to roll over each such B/A Equivalent Loan into another B/A Equivalent Loan, all in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
(l) Notwithstanding any provision hereof but subject to Section 2.10(b), the Borrowers may not prepay any B/A Drawing other than on the last day of its Contract Period.
(m) For greater certainty, all provisions of this Agreement which are applicable to B/As shall also be applicable, mutatis mutandis, to B/A Equivalent Loans.
SECTION 2.06.  (a) (i) In the case of any Borrowing or B/A Drawing to be made on the Closing Date, (A) each Lender shall make its Loan on the Closing Date and disburse the Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) of each B/A to be accepted and purchased by it on the Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency by 9:00 a.m., Local Time, to the account of the Applicable Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose for Loans of such Class and currency by notice to the applicable Lenders and (B) the Applicable Agent will make such Loans or Discount Proceeds available to the relevant Borrower by crediting the amounts so received, in like funds by 10:00 a.m., Local Time, to an account of such Borrower notified by such Borrower to the Applicable Agent. In the case of any Borrowing or B/A Drawing to be made on the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of either the Administrative Agent or the Company, request that each Lender make, and each Lender agrees to make, its Loans and disburse the Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) of each B/A to be accepted and purchased by it by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the applicable currency into an escrow account for each applicable currency in the name of the Administrative Agent, on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, notified by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders (such escrow accounts of the Administrative Agent, collectively, the ""), by 12:00 noon, Local Time one Business Day before the proposed date of Borrowing set forth in the Closing Date Borrowing Request. Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to release all amounts deposited by the Lenders into the Escrow Account (such amounts, the "") to the applicable Borrower on the Closing Date upon the satisfaction (or waiver in accordance with Section 4.02) of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02; that, in the event the Closing Date does not occur within two Business Days of the proposed date of Borrowing set forth in the Closing Date Borrowing Request (the ""), the Escrow Funds shall be returned to the respective Lenders within one Business Day of the Return Date and applied in prepayment of the Loans or amounts due in respect of B/As. The Borrowers agree that interest shall accrue on the Loans from and including the date of the Escrow Funds being deposited in the Escrow Account.

(b) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing or acceptance and purchase of B/As that such Lender will not make available to the Applicable Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees), the Applicable Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant
 
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing or the applicable Discount Proceeds (net of applicable acceptance fees) available to the Applicable Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Applicable Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan or the applicable Discount Rate and pro-rated acceptance fee, as the case may be (subject to the return of such interest as provided in the next sentence). If such Lender pays such amount to the Applicable Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing or such Lender's purchase of B/As and the Applicable Agent shall return to such Borrower any amount (including interest) paid by such Borrower to the Applicable Agent pursuant to this paragraph.
SECTION 2.07.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.

Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Applicable Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the relevant Borrower, or by the Company on its behalf. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit any Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Eurocurrency Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d) or (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 or Section 2.05, as applicable:

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), other than any Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes, then from time to time the Company will pay or cause the other Borrowers to pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any Other Taxes (not otherwise addressed in Section 2.16(a)) to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (except to the extent such penalties, interest or costs are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct by a Lender or Agent), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or by an Agent, on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Lender or Agent shall give the Company written notice of any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to be made hereunder with respect to which the Company has an indemnity obligation, but the failure of such Lender or Agent to give such notice shall not limit its right to receive indemnification hereunder, except that a failure to give such notice will constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of the first sentence of this clause (c) to the extent penalties, interest or costs are incurred solely as a result of the failure to give such notice. Such Lender or Agent shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company in seeking a refund or return of such payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender or Agent that claims to be entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower to whom a Lender has made a Loan is organized or resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, or any other jurisdiction with respect to which the Agent or Lender receives written notice of such exemption from the applicable Borrower with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. Such documentation shall include, as applicable and without limitation, (x) properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8ECI, W-8IMY (including the appropriate attachments thereto) or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case claiming complete exemption from United States withholding tax along with any other documentation required by applicable law, (y) where claiming exemption under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, a statement signed under penalty of perjury that such Person is not (1) a "bank" as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (2) a 10% shareholder of the Company (within the meaning if Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) or (3) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Company or any Loan Party within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code, together with a properly completed U.S. Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and (z) a properly completed and executed U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9. In addition, if a payment made to an Agent or Lender under this Agreement or in respect of any Obligation of a Borrower would be subject to United States withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Person were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable) and such Person is claiming or seeking to claim an exemption from withholding under FATCA, such Person shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Person has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Such Lender or Agent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and such Borrower from any penalties, interest or other costs incurred by such Borrower solely as a result of the failure of such Lender or Agent to comply properly with such documentation requirements.
 
(f) Each Agent or Lender, on the date it becomes an Agent or a Lender hereunder (or designates a new lending office), will designate lending offices for the Loans to be made and held by it and B/As to be accepted and purchased by it, and represents and warrants that, on such date (but without giving effect to any Change in Law after the date hereof), it will not be liable and the relevant Borrower will not be required to withhold or deduct for any withholding tax that is imposed (i) by the United States of America on payments by the Company or any US Borrowing Subsidiary, (ii) by Canada on payments by any Canadian Borrowing Subsidiary, or (iii) unless such Agent or Lender is a Treaty Lender required to complete an application for a reduced withholding tax rate under an applicable income tax treaty with the United Kingdom in order to receive the benefit of such reduced withholding tax rate, by the United Kingdom on payments from the United Kingdom by any UK Borrowing Subsidiary, in each case except if such Lender (or assignor, if any) was, at the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law (and would have been able to comply on the date that the applicable Lender or assignor became a Lender hereunder). Each Agent and each Lender shall provide documentation to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.16(e)) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company to establish the foregoing. If an Agent or a Lender is unable to comply with this Section 2.16(f) because of a change in applicable law described above, such Agent or Lender shall provide the relevant Borrower with (i) adequate information as will permit such Borrower to determine the applicable rate of withholding tax and (ii) any additional properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the relevant Borrower which is necessary to make such withholding on a payment made hereunder. Each Agent or Lender shall indemnify the relevant Borrower for the full amount of Excluded Taxes paid or required to be paid by a Borrower on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder or under any Loan Document as a result of such Agent's or Lender's failure to comply with this Section 2.16(f).
(g) If a Lender or an Agent (each a "") receives a refund or credit in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes pursuant to this Section 2.16 and, in the case of a credit, such credit reduces the Tax liability of the Finance Party and is in the good faith opinion of the relevant Finance Party both identifiable and quantifiable without requiring such Finance Party or its professional advisers to expend a material amount of time or incur a material cost in so identifying or quantifying, the Finance Party will pay over the amount of such refund or credit to the relevant Borrower to the extent the Finance Party has received indemnity payments or additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund or credit and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund or credit); , that the relevant Borrower, upon the request of the Finance Party, agrees to repay the amount it received to the Finance Party within 30 days of such request, plus penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority (except to the extent such penalties or other charges are incurred solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the relevant Finance Party), if the refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or cancelled. Amounts payable to a Borrower under this clause (g) with respect to a refund received by a Finance Party will be paid to the relevant Borrower within 30 days of receipt of such refund by the Finance Party. Amounts payable under this clause (g) with respect to a credit realized by a Finance Party will be paid within 30 days of the determination by the Finance Party that the credit reduced the Tax liability of such Finance Party. To the extent that a UK Borrowing Subsidiary has been required to make an increased payment pursuant to Section 2.16(a) to an Agent or Lender solely as a result of an application for relief under an applicable income tax treaty being submitted but not processed before the relevant interest payment date, such Agent or Lender shall be required to make an application under such treaty for a refund of the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes which have caused such increased payment to become payable.

Unless such Treaty Lender is eligible to use the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in relation to such payments, such Treaty Lender shall as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming a Lender under this Agreement submit an application for gross payment to its local tax authority and provide a copy of such application to the Company. If such Treaty Lender is eligible to use the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in relation to such payments, such Treaty Lender shall use such scheme and shall promptly provide written notification to the Company of its intention to do so as soon as reasonably
 
practicable after becoming a Lender under this Agreement (the "Relevant Accession Date") and, in connection therewith, (i) each UK Borrowing Subsidiary that is a Borrower on the Relevant Accession Date shall file a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Treaty Lender with HM Revenue & Customs within 30 days of the Relevant Accession Date, and (ii) each UK Borrowing Subsidiary which becomes a Borrower after the Relevant Accession Date shall file a duly completed form DTTP2 in respect of such Treaty Lender with HM Revenue & Customs within 30 days of becoming a Borrower and shall promptly provide such Treaty Lender with a copy thereof.
(i) This Section 2.16 shall not be construed to require any Agent, or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 2.17.  (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest or fees, or of amounts payable under Sections 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time (unless a different time is specified under a particular provision hereof or thereof), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Applicable Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Applicable Agent to the applicable account specified in Schedule 2.17 or, in any such case, to such other account as the Applicable Agent shall from time to time specify reasonably in advance of the date of the required payment in a notice delivered to the Company; that such payments shall be subject to the principles of Section 2.16(f) (substituting "Applicable Agent" for "Lender" and "account" for "lending offices"); that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Applicable Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any Lender or other Person promptly following receipt thereof to the appropriate lending office or other address specified by such Lender or other Person. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan and all amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing shall be made in the currency of such Loan or B/A Drawing; all other payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by an Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if such Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by such Agent to make such payment.

(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to any Agent from any Borrower to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due from such Borrower hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on its Loans or amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans, amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing, as applicable, of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of their respective Loans and amounts owing in respect of any B/A Drawing and accrued interest thereon; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the relevant Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d) Unless the Applicable Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Applicable Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Applicable Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Applicable Agent, at a rate determined by the Applicable Agent in accordance with banking industry practices on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it to any Agent pursuant to this Agreement, then the Agents may, in their discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by them for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations to the Agents until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18.  (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such assignment.

2
/3% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments of all Lenders, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, but with the cooperation of the Administrative Agent, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender (a "") to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent if such consent would be required under Section 10.04(b), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Replaced Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within one (1) Business Day of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Replaced Lender, then such Replaced Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Replaced Lender.

(c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above shall be determined by the relevant Lender, acting in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the relevant Loans, and such additional interest so notified to the relevant Borrower by such Lender shall be payable to such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loans.

provided
 
Defaulting Lender or (v) postpone the scheduled date for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans made by such Defaulting Lender, shall in each case require the consent of such Defaulting Lender (which consent shall be deemed to have been given if such Defaulting Lender fails to respond to a written request for such consent within 30 days after receipt of such written request);
(d) [Intentionally Omitted].
(e) [Intentionally Omitted].
(f) in the event that the Agents and the Borrowers each agree (acting reasonably) that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Defaulting Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Defaulting Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its applicable Tranche Percentage;
(g) the operation of any other provision of this Section 2.21, will not (i) constitute a waiver or release of any claim the Borrowers, the Agents or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender, or (except with respect to clause (f) above) cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender, or (ii) except as expressly provided in this Section 2.21, excuse or otherwise modify the performance by the Borrowers of their respective obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; and
(h) anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may (i) require such Lender to assign and delegate all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant to Section 2.18(b) or (ii) terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender on a non-pro rata basis upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders thereof), that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrowers, the Agents or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.

CAM Exchange.
provided
(b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by either Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages. Any direct payment received by a Lender on or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of set-off, in respect of an Obligation shall be paid over to the Applicable Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith.
In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit to the other Borrowers hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of such other Borrowers. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the
 
provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any other Borrower to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, the Company shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrower arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower to the Agents and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full performance and payment of the Obligations.
In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Persons named in the heading of this Agreement are hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent and Canadian Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders, each assignee of any Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agents to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agents by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent and, to the extent expressly provided herein, the Canadian Administrative Agent are hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Company of any Event of Default specified in this Agreement of which the
 
Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Company or any other Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as received by the Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement in the event that all the capital stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of to a Person other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company in a transaction not prohibited by this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
With respect to the Loans made by it under this Agreement, each Agent in its individual capacity and not as Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent under the Loan Documents and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and their duties under the Loan Documents shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) no Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) no Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that such Agent is required to exercise upon receipt of notice in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); that such Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, no Agent shall have any duty to disclose, and no Agent shall be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the institution serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as such Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by a Borrower, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
provided
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and in good faith believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, each Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless such Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.
In taking any discretionary action hereunder, or in determining whether any provision hereof is applicable to any event, transaction or circumstance, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, but shall not be required (unless required by any other express provision hereof) to, communicate such proposed action or determination to the Lenders prior to taking or making the same, and shall be entitled (subject to any otherwise applicable requirement of Section 10.02(b)), in the absence of any contrary communication received from any Lender within a reasonable period of time specified in such communication from the Administrative Agent, to assume that such proposed action or determination is satisfactory to such Lender.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Company shall have the right, with the consent of the Required Lenders (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor; , that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Lenders, and not the Company, shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint such successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Company (or, if applicable, the Required Lenders) and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or Toronto or London, as applicable, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.
provided
To the extent required by any applicable law, each Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.16, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless each Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 10 days after written demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for such Agent) incurred by or asserted against such Agent by the United States Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of such Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify such Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective) unless such failure was due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by such Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes each Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due such Agent under this Article. The agreements in this Article shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of each Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers shall have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as an Agent or a Lender hereunder.
In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, each Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether such Agent shall have made any demand on the applicable Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Agents (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Agents) allowed in such judicial proceeding and (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the applicable Agent and, in the event that an Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to such Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due such Agent. Nothing herein shall be deemed to give the Agents the right to vote the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding pursuant to such Debtor Relief Law.

(a) Except in the case of notices and other communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and subject to paragraph (b) below), all notices and other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

SECTION 10.02.  (a) No failure or delay by any Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
Waivers; Amendments
.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.08(e), none of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders (subject to clause (c) below) or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; that, except as expressly contemplated by Section 2.08(e), no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that the waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute an increase in the Commitment of such Lender), (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan, any amount payable in respect of any B/A or reduce the Applicable Rate, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount, (iii) postpone the date of any scheduled payment of the principal amount of any Loan, any amount payable in respect of any B/A, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such scheduled payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender owed such amount or which holds such Commitment, (iv) change Section 2.17(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, or amend the pro rata treatment of each reduction of the Commitments under Section 2.08, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or reduce the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release the Company or all or substantially all the Subsidiary Guarantors from its or their obligations under Article VIII or the Subsidiary Guarantee Agreement, without the written consent of each Lender, (vii) change any provisions of Section 7.02 without the written consent of each Lender, or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than those of Lenders holding Loans of any other Class without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each adversely affected Class; that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of any Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of such Agent, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Global Tranche Lenders (but not the US/UK Tranche Lenders) or the US/UK Tranche Lenders (but not the Global Tranche Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrowers and the Subsidiary Guarantors will promptly enter into any amendment to this Agreement or any other Loan Document (and the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to enter into such amendment on behalf of such Lender) to the extent reasonably requested by either Arranger (i) to give effect to any applicable "market flex" provisions in accordance with Section 2 of the Fee Letter referred to in clause (a) of the definition of "Fee Letter" and (ii) to incorporate any minor changes to this Agreement or any other Loan Document that are reasonably requested by prospective Lenders, and are reasonably acceptable to the Company, during the primary syndication of the Commitments and the Loans ( that such minor changes pursuant to this clause (ii) are not materially adverse to the Borrowers or inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter) (it being understood and agreed that no Arranger may request any amendment or modification to Section 4.02 if such amendment or modification would impose new or additional conditions precedent to, or otherwise expand, the conditions precedent set forth therein).
provided
 
SECTION 10.03.  (a) The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Arrangers and the Agents and their Affiliates (limited in the case of legal fees to the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP only and, with respect to any amendment, modification or waiver, one counsel per jurisdiction and any other counsel to the extent required by conflicts of interest), in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any Agent or any Lender (limited in the case of legal fees, (x) with respect to any Agent, to the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, one counsel per jurisdiction and any other counsel to the extent required by conflicts of interest, and (y) with respect to all of the Lenders combined, to the reasonable fees, charges and out-of-pocket disbursements of one counsel per jurisdiction and any other counsel to the extent required by conflicts of interest) in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with any Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or the B/As accepted and purchased, hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver

Indemnitee
provided
(c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to any Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against such Agent in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments at the time (or most recently prior to such time).
provided
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, the Agents and the Lenders shall not assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
SECTION 10.04.

Successors and Assigns

consent of each Lender thereto (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agents and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than to any Competitor) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it); that (i) the Administrative Agent and, except in the case of an assignment (A) to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, (B) at a time when an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), (b), (h) or (i) has occurred and is continuing or (C) with respect to assignments (such assignments to be made in accordance with Section 2 of the Commitment Letter) in connection with the syndication of the Commitments and the Loans by the "Commitment Parties" (as defined in the Commitment Letter) to the extent such consent is not required pursuant to Section 2 of the Commitment Letter, the Company must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$10,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, which shall contain, without limitation, a representation and warranty from the assignee that such assignee is not a Competitor, together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500 (it being understood that such fee is not payable by the Company), (iv) in connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Borrowers, each Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and the documentation required to be delivered under Sections 2.16(e) and (f), (vi) no assignee shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.16 than the assigning Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the assigned interest unless the entitlement to receive any additional amounts under Section 2.16 arises as a result of a change in applicable law after the date such assignee becomes a party to this Agreement and (vii) the assignee shall be a Qualifying Lender, that if the assignee is a Treaty Lender then such Treaty Lender and each UK Borrowing Subsidiary shall comply with Section 2.16(h). Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the consent of the Company is required pursuant to this Section 10.04(b) in connection with any proposed assignment, then the Company shall be deemed to have consented to such proposed assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Business Days after having received written notice of such proposed assignment.

The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Loans and Commitments are intended to be treated as registered obligations for tax purposes and the right, title and interest of the Lenders in and to such Loans and Commitments shall be transferable only in accordance with the terms hereof. This Section 10.04(c) shall be construed so that the Loans and Commitments are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code.

(d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender entitled to such benefits and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, but only to the extent that such Participant agrees to comply with and be subject to Section 2.16 as if it were a Lender. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the relevant Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the ""). No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to the Borrowers or any other Person (including the existence or identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement) except (i) to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Loans or other obligations are in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the applicable United States Treasury Regulations or (ii) with respect to any Person whose interest in the Obligations is treated as a participation by reason of the penultimate sentence of Section 10.04(b).

Participant Register
(f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company's prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with and be subject to Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.
(g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "") of such Granting Bank, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.01; that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment to make any Loan by any SPC and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.

2. Calculation of the Mandatory Costs Rate. The Mandatory Costs Rate is an addition to the interest rate on each Eurocurrency Loan or any other sum on which interest is to be calculated to compensate the Lenders for the cost attributable to Eurocurrency Loan or such sum resulting from the imposition from time to time under or pursuant to the Act and/or by the Bank of England, the FSA (or other United Kingdom governmental authorities or agencies) or the European Central Bank of a requirement to place non-interest bearing or Special Deposits (whether interest bearing or not) with the Bank of England and/or pay fees to the FSA calculated by reference to the liabilities used to fund the relevant Eurocurrency Loan or such sum.
The "" will be the rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be equal to the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) resulting from the application of the following formula:
Mandatory Costs Rate
For Sterling:
XL + S(L-D) + F x 0.01
100-(X + S)
For other Foreign Currencies:
F x 0.01
300
where on the day of application of the formula
X is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (in excess of any stated minimum) by reference to which Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) is required under or pursuant to the Act to maintain cash ratio deposits with the Bank of England;
L is the rate of interest (exclusive of Applicable Rate and Mandatory Costs Rate) payable on that day on the related Eurocurrency Loan or unpaid sum pursuant to this Agreement;
F is the rate of charge payable by Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) to the FSA pursuant to the Fees Regulations and expressed in pounds per 1 million of the Fees Base of such Reference Lender;
S is the level of interest-bearing Special Deposits, expressed as a percentage of Eligible Liabilities, which Deutsche Bank AG, Canada Branch is required to maintain by the Bank of England (or other United Kingdom governmental authorities or agencies); and
D is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to Deutsche Bank AG (or its applicable affiliate) on Special Deposits.
(X, L, S and D are to be expressed in the formula as numbers and not as percentages. A negative result obtained from subtracting D from L shall be counted as zero.)
The Mandatory Costs Rate attributable to a Eurocurrency Loan or other sum for any period shall be calculated at or about 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the first day of such period for the duration of such period.
The determination of Mandatory Costs Rate by the Administrative Agent in relation to any period shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.
3. Change of Requirements
If there is any change in circumstance (including the imposition of alternative or additional requirements) which in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent renders or will render the above formula (or any element thereof, or any defined term used therein) inappropriate or inapplicable, the Administrative Agent shall (with the written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld) be entitled to vary the same. Any such variation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties and shall apply from the date specified in such notice.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.

The Agents and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been fully paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
SECTION 5. . Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
SECTION 6. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor
Agreement to Pay; Indemnity: Subrogation: Contribution
 
shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Agents and Lenders.
Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.

(iii) each UK Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, jointly with the other UK Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the payment when and as due of the Obligations of the UK Borrowing Subsidiaries (other than its own Obligations as a UK Borrowing Subsidiary).
(b) Each of the Guarantors further agrees that the due and punctual payment of the Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Obligation. Without prejudice to the Borrowers' rights to receive demands for payment in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and to
the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Guarantors waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrower or any other Loan Party of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment.
SECTION 3. . Each of the Guarantors further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Agent or Lender to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Agent or Lender in favor of any Borrower or any other Person.
Guarantee of Payment
SECTION 4. .
No Limitations, Etc
(a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Section 20, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any Agent or Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise; (ii) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Guarantor under this Agreement; (iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Obligations; or (v) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor) or which would impair or limit the right of any Guarantor to subrogation.
(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, other than the payment in full in cash of all the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor. The Agents and the Lenders may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor have been fully paid in full in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, as the case may be.
SECTION 5. . Each of the Guarantors agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Agent or Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
SECTION 6. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Agent or Lender may have at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor that guarantees such Obligation hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by any Agent or Lender, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Applicable Agent or Lender in cash the amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligations then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Each Guarantor further agrees that if payment in respect of any Obligation guaranteed hereunder by such Guarantor shall be due in a currency other than US Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or other event, payment of such Obligation in such currency or at such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the reasonable judgment of any Agent or Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of the Administrative Agent, such Guarantor shall make payment of such Obligation in US Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the
Agreement to Pay; Indemnity: Subrogation: Contribution
 
date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify each Agent and Lender against any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment. Upon payment by any Guarantor of any sums as provided in this Section 6, all rights of such Guarantor against any of the Borrowers or any other Guarantor arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Obligations owed by such Borrower or Guarantor to the Agents and Lenders.
Subject to the subordination provisions contained in the preceding paragraph of this Section 6, (i) each of the Borrowers agrees to indemnify any Guarantor making any payment as required under this Section 6 for the full amount of such payment and, until such indemnification obligation shall have been satisfied, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment, and (ii) each Guarantor (a "") agrees that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement, and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrowers as provided for in clause (i), the Contributing Guarantor shall, to the extent the Claiming Guarantor shall not have been so indemnified by the Borrowers, indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor) and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 21, the date of the Supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under clause (i) to the extent of such payment.

Subject to Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement, all payments by each Guarantor under this Agreement shall be made without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (and the Administrative Agent and each Guarantor hereby agree to comply with the provisions of Section 2.16 of the Credit Agreement as if said Section referred to this Agreement and payments by such Guarantor hereunder).

The rights and remedies of the Agents and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Molson Coors Brewing Company (NYSE: TAP; TSX) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement with StarBev L.P., owned by funds ("CVC Funds") advised by CVC Capital Partners Limited ("CVC") and StarBev management, to acquire StarBev for 2.65 billion ($3.54 billion). Headquartered in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Prague, Czech Republic, StarBev operates nine breweries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and generated 2011 sales of approximately 0.7 billion ($1.0 billion) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 241 million ($322 million).
April 3, 2012 (DENVER AND MONTREAL) 
1
The purchase price represents a multiple of approximately 11x EBITDA.
"The acquisition of StarBev fits squarely into Molson Coors' strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world," said Peter Swinburn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors. "The Central and Eastern European beer market is attractive, with strong historical trends and upside potential as the region returns to its pre-economic-crisis growth rates.
"StarBev, as a market leader in the CEE region, provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth and an excellent foundation from which to extend our key brands, such as Carling, into Central and Eastern Europe. Staropramen, StarBev's international flagship brand, will also enhance our portfolio in some of our current and planned markets."
StarBev, which employs approximately 4,100 people, has brewing operations in the Czech Republic, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and also sells its brands in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovakia. StarBev brews 13.3 million hectoliters annually and holds a top three market share position in each of its markets. Starbev's portfolio of more than 20 brands includes local champions such as Borsodi, Kamenitza, Bergenbier, Ozusko, Jelen and Niksicko and also distributes brands such as Stella Artois, Beck's, Hoegaarden, Lowenbrau and Leffe under license.
Following the acquisition, Molson Coors expects that significantly more of its revenue will come from growth and emerging markets. The CEE markets are expected to benefit from positive volume and per capita consumption trends over the long-term.
 
 
 
Mr. Swinburn continued, "Making targeted acquisitions that expand our global presence and drive shareholder value is a key pillar of our stated growth strategy. We are committed to being disciplined buyers. We believe this acquisition, which is financially compelling and meets all of our return on capital requirements, is consistent with these goals."
Molson Coors expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings in the first full year of operations and to generate approximately $50 million of pre-tax operational synergies by 2015, primarily through production efficiencies, procurement, systems and related areas.
Mr. Swinburn concluded, "StarBev is a strong brewing operation with great brands, talented management and employees who will benefit from being part of a global, brand-led brewing company that can bring additional innovation and marketing expertise to their operations. We have very exciting plans for growing this business and its brands. We are impressed with StarBev's operations and look forward to working with the StarBev team to capitalize on the great opportunities in their markets."
Alain Beyens, CEO of StarBev said: "We are delighted to become part of one of the world's largest brewers. It has been great to work with CVC as we have developed and grown this business over the last few years. Their support has enabled StarBev to become a leading innovator of world-class brands. I am convinced Molson Coors will take StarBev to the next level of development and growth."
The transaction is subject to approval by certain European competition authorities and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012. Following the close, StarBev will be operated as a separate business unit within Molson Coors and will remain headquartered in the Czech Republic.
Molson Coors has committed financing in place to complete the acquisition.
