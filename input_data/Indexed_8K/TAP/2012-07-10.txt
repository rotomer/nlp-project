Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 
On July 5, 2012, Molson Coors Brewing Company (the "Company") received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), indicating that the Company was deficient in meeting the requirements of Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the "LCM") because the Company's audit committee was not composed of at least three members at the time of the notice. This deficiency was the result of the retirement from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of two of the Company's independent directors who served on the Company's audit committee.  Prior to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders these individuals had reached the Company's mandatory director retirement age, and were therefore not eligible for re-election to the Board.
 
On July 9, 2012, the Board appointed Roger Eaton, an independent director, to serve on the Company's audit committee.  Therefore, the Company currently complies with Section 303A.07(a) of the LCM.
 
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
As previously disclosed on a Form 8-K, on May 31, 2012, Roger Eaton was appointed to the Board. At the time of that filing, Mr. Eaton had not been appointed to any committees of the Board.  On July 9, 2012, the Board appointed Mr. Eaton to serve on the Company's audit committee.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
