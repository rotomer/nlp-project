The Revolving Facilities Agreement provides for a one-year revolving credit facility of EUR150,000,000. The EUR150,000,000 commitment is split between a EUR110,000,000 facility which can be utilized by the European Borrowers for general corporate purposes, with up to EUR10,000,000 of such facility being provided in the form of ancillary facilities at the discretion of the lender, and a EUR40,000,000 facility which can be utilized by the European Borrowers only in the form of letters of credit to secure cash pooling services.

The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 22 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.

(f)
                                   
any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or
 
(g)
                                
any insolvency or similar proceedings.
 
22.5
                       
Guarantor Intent
 
Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 22.4 (), the Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following:  business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.
Waiver of Defences
 
22.6

refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and the Guarantor shall not be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(b)
                                
hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from the Guarantor or on account of the Guarantor's liability under this Clause 22.
 
22.8
                       
Deferral of Guarantor's rights
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, the Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 22:
 
(a)

(d)

Guarantee and Indemnity
 
(e)
