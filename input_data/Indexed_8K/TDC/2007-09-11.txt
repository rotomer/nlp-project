: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and stockholders:
FIFTH
(1) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.
(2) The number of members of the Board of Directors shall be fixed, from time to time, exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors, subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, if any. As used in this Article FIFTH and in Article TENTH, the term "entire Board of Directors" means the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies.
(3) The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. The initial division of the members of the Board of Directors into classes shall be made by the decision of the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. The term of the initial Class I directors shall terminate on the date of the 2008 annual meeting; the term of the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 2009 annual meeting; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on the date of the 2010 annual meeting. At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 2008, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.
(4) A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and thereafter until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify,
 
subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Directors need not be stockholders.
(5) Subject to applicable law and to the terms of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled only by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors of such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. Except as otherwise required by applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, any or all of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such class or series, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article FIFTH unless expressly provided by such terms.
provided
(6) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the stockholders; , , that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such By-Laws had not been adopted.
provided
however
: No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article SIXTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
SIXTH
: The Corporation shall indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or hereafter in effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and personal and legal representa-
SEVENTH
 
tives; , , that, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs, executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article SEVENTH shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article SEVENTH to directors and officers of the Corporation. The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws of the Corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Any repeal or modification of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.
provided
however
: Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, and the ability of the stockholders to consent in writing to the taking of any action is hereby specifically denied. Unless otherwise required by law or the terms of the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of a class or series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by either the (1) Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there be one, or (2) the Chief Executive Officer, and shall be called by the Chief Executive Officer at the request in writing made pursuant to a resolution of (a) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or (b) a committee of the Board of Directors that has been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority include the power to call such meetings. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. The ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders is hereby specifically denied. At a special meeting of stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto).
EIGHTH
: Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the Corporation.
NINTH
: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporation's By-Laws. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the entire Board of Directors shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Corporation's By-Laws. The Corporation's By-Laws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of voting power of
TENTH
 
the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors, except that unless approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of the By-Laws inconsistent with the purpose and intent of any provision of any of Article II, Section 3, 9, 13, 15 or 16 or Article III, Section 1, 2 or 6, Article VIII and Article IX of the By-Laws.
: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Designation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation's By-Laws or the DGCL, and all rights herein conferred upon stockholders are granted subject to such reservation; , , that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (and in addition to any other vote that may be required by law), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors shall be required to amend, alter, change or repeal, or to adopt any provision as part of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with the purpose and intent of Articles FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH and TENTH of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or this Article ELEVENTH; and that no Preferred Stock Designation shall be amended after the issuance of any shares of the class or series of Preferred Stock created thereby, except in accordance with the terms of such Preferred Stock Designation and the requirements of applicable law.

Without limiting the foregoing, at the reasonable request and expense of the other party, each of NCR and Teradata shall cooperate with the other to enforce any rights or remedies it may have with respect to any Asset the transfer of which is delayed or not completed whether as a result of a required Consent and/or Governmental Approval or otherwise.
(d) If and when the Consents and/or Governmental Approvals, the absence of which caused the deferral of transfer of any Asset pursuant to Section 2.10(b), are obtained, the transfer of the applicable Asset shall be effected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or the applicable Ancillary Agreement.
(e) The Person retaining an Asset due to the deferral of the transfer of such Asset shall not be obligated, in connection with the foregoing, to expend any money unless the necessary funds are advanced by the Person entitled to the Asset, other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys' fees and recording or similar fees, all of which shall be promptly reimbursed by the Person entitled to such Asset.
(a) Each of NCR and Teradata, at the request of any of the others, shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate (including with respect to any federal government contract) or assign all obligations under agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that constitute Teradata Liabilities, or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements other than any member of the Teradata Group, so that, in any such case, Teradata and its Subsidiaries will be solely responsible for such Liabilities; , , that none of NCR or Teradata shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom such consents, approvals, substitutions and amendments are requested.

Teradata shall indemnify each NCR Indemnitee and hold each of them harmless against any Liabilities arising in connection therewith. NCR shall, without further consideration, pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to Teradata promptly all money, rights and other consideration received by it or any member of its respective Group in respect of such performance (unless any such consideration is an Excluded Asset). If and when any such consent, approval, release, substitution or amendment shall be obtained or such agreement, lease, license or other rights or obligations shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, NCR shall thereafter assign, or cause to be assigned, all its rights, obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any rights or obligations of any member of its Group to Teradata without payment of further consideration and Teradata shall, without the payment of any further consideration, assume such rights and obligations.
(c) To the extent it is not feasible as an administrative or practical manner to implement the provisions of this Section 2.11, NCR or another member of the NCR Group may pay or satisfy the applicable Liability and Teradata or another member of the Teradata Group shall reimburse it to the extent it represents payment for or satisfaction of a Teradata Liability.
(d) Schedule 2.11 to this Agreement sets forth a list of contracts and agreements. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to replicate the contracts and agreements to the extent contemplated thereby.
(a) Each of NCR and Teradata, at the request of any of the others, shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, or to cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval or amendment required to novate or assign all obligations under agreements, leases, licenses and other obligations or Liabilities of any nature whatsoever that do not constitute Teradata Liabilities, or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements other than any member of the NCR Group, so that, in any such case, the members of the NCR Group will be solely responsible for such Liabilities; , , that none of NCR or Teradata shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom such consents, approvals, substitutions and amendments are requested.

NCR shall indemnify each Teradata Indemnitee and hold each of them harmless against any Liabilities arising in connection
 
therewith. Teradata shall cause each member of the Teradata Group without further consideration, to pay and remit, or cause to be paid or remitted, to NCR or to another member of the NCR Group specified by NCR promptly all money, rights and other consideration received by it or any member of the Teradata Group in respect of such performance. If and when any such consent, approval, release, substitution or amendment shall be obtained or such agreement, lease, license or other rights or obligations shall otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, Teradata shall promptly assign, or cause to be assigned, all its rights, obligations and other Liabilities thereunder or any rights or obligations of any member of the Teradata Group to NCR or to another member of the NCR Group specified by NCR without payment of further consideration and NCR, without the payment of any further consideration shall, or shall cause such other member of the NCR Group to, assume such rights and obligations.
(c) To the extent it is not feasible as an administrative or practical manner to implement the provisions of this Section 2.12, Teradata or another member of the Teradata Group may pay or satisfy the applicable Liability and NCR or another member of the NCR Group shall reimburse it to the extent it represents payment for or satisfaction of a Liability of a member of the NCR Group.

provided
(d) Teradata shall not make, and shall not permit any member of the Teradata Group to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against NCR or any member of the NCR Group, or any other Person released pursuant to Section 5.1(a), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 5.1(a). NCR shall not, and shall not permit any member of the NCR Group, to make any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against Teradata or any member of the Teradata Group, or any other Person released pursuant to Section 5.1(b), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 5.1(b).
(e) It is the intent of each of NCR and Teradata by virtue of the provisions of this Section 5.1 to provide for a full and complete release and discharge of all Liabilities existing or arising from all acts and events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur and all conditions existing or alleged to have existed on or before the Effective Time, between or among Teradata or any member of the Teradata Group, on the one hand, and NCR or any member of the NCR Group, on the other hand (including any contractual agreements or arrangements existing or alleged to exist between or among any such members on or before the Effective Time), except as expressly set forth in Section 5.1(c). At any time, at the request of any other party, each party shall cause each member of its respective Group to execute and deliver releases reflecting the provisions hereof.
Teradata shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless NCR, each member of the NCR Group and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "NCR Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Liabilities of the
5.2
Indemnification by Teradata.
 
NCR Indemnitees relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the following items (without duplication):
(a) the failure of Teradata or any other member of the Teradata Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Teradata Liabilities or Teradata Contract in accordance with their respective terms, whether prior to or after the Effective Time or the date hereof;
(b) the Teradata Business, any Teradata Liability or any Teradata Contract or any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with any of the foregoing;
(c) any breach by Teradata or any member of the Teradata Group of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (except to the extent any Ancillary Agreement contains an express provision on the limitation of liability); and
(d) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with respect to all information contained in any Information Statement or any other Disclosure Document.
NCR shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Teradata, each member of the Teradata Group and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Teradata Indemnitees"), from and against any and all Liabilities of the Teradata Indemnitees relating to, arising out of or resulting from any of the following items (without duplication):
5.3
Indemnification by NCR.
(a) the failure of NCR or any other member of the NCR Group or any other Person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any Liabilities of the NCR Group other than the Teradata Liabilities, whether prior to or after the Effective Time or the date hereof;
(b) the NCR Self-Services Business or any Liability of the NCR Group other than the Teradata Liabilities or any action taken or omitted to be taken in connection with any of the foregoing; and
(c) any breach by NCR or any member of the NCR Group of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (except to the extent any Ancillary Agreement contains an express provision on the limitation of liability).
(a) The parties intend that any Liability subject to indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to this Article V will be net of Insurance Proceeds applicable to the Liability. Accordingly, the amount which any party (an "Indemnifying Party") is required to pay to any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnitee") will be reduced by any Insurance Proceeds theretofore actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in reduction of the related Liability. If an Indemnitee receives a payment (an "Indemnity Payment") required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives
5.4
Indemnification Obligations Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Amounts.
 
Insurance Proceeds, then the Indemnitee will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the Insurance Proceeds recovery had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made.
(b) An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other third party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (, a benefit they would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall obligate any member of any Group to seek to collect or recover any Insurance Proceeds.
i.e.
(a) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental Authority) who is not a member of the NCR Group or the Teradata Group of any claim or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (collectively, a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 5.2 or 5.3, or any other Section of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give such Indemnifying Party written notice thereof within 20 days after becoming aware of such Third Party Claim. Any such notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of any Indemnitee or other Person to give notice as provided in this Section 5.5(a) shall not relieve the related Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article V, except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice.
5.5
Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party Claims.
(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend (and, unless the Indemnifying Party has specified any reservations or exceptions, to seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any Third Party Claim. Within 30 days after the receipt of notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 5.5(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such Indemnitee except as set forth in the next sentence. In the event that the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in any such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all Indemnitees shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party.
(c) If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election as provided in Section 5.5(d), such Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Claim at the cost and expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) of the Indemnifying Party.
 
(d) Unless the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, no Indemnitee may settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.
(e) In the case of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnifying Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of the Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitee if the effect thereof is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other order or other nonmonetary relief to be entered, directly or indirectly, against any Indemnitee.
(f) The provisions of Section 5.5 (other than this Section 5.5(f)) and Section 5.6 shall not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Sharing Agreement).
(g) Schedule 5.5(g) sets forth certain additional rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the category of claims specified thereon.
(a) Any claim on account of a Liability which does not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party as contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
5.6
Additional Matters
.
(b) In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or against any other person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.
(c) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named defendant, if the Indemnifying Party shall so request, the parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named defendant if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying Party to manage the Action as set forth in this Section and the Indemnifying Party shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys' fees, experts' fees and all other external expenses, and the allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement.
 
(d) The indemnity obligations of this Article V shall apply as between the members of the NCR Group, on the one hand, and the Teradata Group, on the other hand, notwithstanding any contrary provision in any contract or agreement or other document with a third party allocating Liability in a different manner in order to obtain the consent of such third party to an assignment, novation or replication of a contract or agreement.
The remedies provided in this Article V shall be cumulative and, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, shall not preclude assertion by any Indemnitee of any other rights or the seeking of any and all other remedies against any Indemnifying Party.
5.7
Remedies Cumulative.
5.8 Survival of Indemnities.
(a) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article V shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Indemnitee; (ii) the knowledge by the Indemnitee of Indemnifiable Losses for which it might be entitled to indemnification or contribution hereunder; and (iii) any termination of this Agreement.
(b) The rights and obligations of each Party and their respective Indemnitees under this Article V shall survive the sale or other Transfer by any Party or its respective Subsidiaries of any Assets or businesses or the assignment by it of any Liabilities.
5.9 Limitation on Liability
Except as may expressly be set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, neither NCR nor Teradata nor any member of either Group shall in any event have any Liability to the other nor to any member of the other's Group for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages, whether or not caused by or resulting from negligence or breach of obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement and whether or not informed of the possibility of the existence of such damages, that the limitation in this Section 5.9 shall not apply to an Indemnitor's indemnification obligations hereunder or in any Ancillary Agreement with respect to any Liability any Indemnitee may have to any third party not affiliated with any member of the NCR Group or the Teradata Group for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages.
provided however
(a) NCR and Teradata agree to cooperate in good faith to provide for an orderly transition of insurance coverage from the date hereof through the Distribution Date and for the treatment of any Insurance Policies that will remain in effect following the Effective Time on a mutually agreeable basis, in each case subject to the terms and conditions hereof. In no event shall NCR, any other member of the NCR Group or any NCR Indemnitee or Teradata Indemnitee have liability or obligation whatsoever to any member of the Teradata Group in the event that any Insurance Policy or other contract or policy of insurance shall be terminated or otherwise cease to be in effect for any reason, shall be unavailable or
6.1
Insurance Matters.
 
inadequate to cover any Liability of any member of the Teradata Group for any reason whatsoever or shall not be renewed or extended beyond the current expiration date.
(b) (i) Except as otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement, the parties intend by this Agreement that Teradata and each other member of the Teradata Group be successors-in-interest to all rights that any member of the Teradata Group may have as of the Effective Time as a subsidiary, affiliate, division or department of NCR prior to the Effective Time under any policy of insurance issued to NCR by any insurance carrier unaffiliated with NCR or under any agreements related to such policies executed and delivered prior to the Effective Time, including any rights such member of the Teradata Group may have, as an insured or additional named insured, subsidiary, affiliate, division or department, to avail itself of any such policy of insurance or any such agreements related to such policies as in effect prior to the Effective Time. At the request of Teradata, NCR shall take all reasonable steps, including the execution and delivery of any instruments, to effect the foregoing; that NCR shall not be required to pay any amounts, waive any rights or incur any Liabilities in connection therewith.
provided however
(ii) Except as otherwise contemplated by any Ancillary Agreement, after the Effective Time, none of NCR or Teradata or any member of their respective Groups shall, without the consent of the other, provide any such insurance carrier with a release, or amend, modify or waive any rights under any such policy or agreement, if such release, amendment, modification or waiver would adversely affect any rights or potential rights of any member of the other Group thereunder; , , that the foregoing shall not (A) preclude any member of any Group from presenting any claim or from impairing or exhausting any policy limit through actual loss payments, (B) require any member of any Group to pay any premium or other amount or to incur any Liability, or (C) require any member of any Group to renew, extend or continue any policy in force. Each of Teradata and NCR will share such information as is reasonably necessary in order to permit the other to manage and conduct its insurance matters in an orderly fashion.
provided
however
(c) This Agreement shall not be considered as an attempted assignment of any interest under a policy of insurance or as a contract of insurance and shall not be construed to waive any right or remedy of any member of the NCR Group in respect of any Insurance Policy or any other contract or policy of insurance.

(b) Each of NCR and Teradata is aware that from time to time certain business opportunities may arise which more than one Group may be financially able to undertake, and which are, from their nature, in the line of more than one Group's business and are of practical advantage to more than one Group. In connection therewith, the parties agree that if either NCR or Teradata acquires knowledge of an opportunity that meets the foregoing standard with respect to more than one Group, neither NCR or Teradata shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to any of the others and may pursue or acquire such opportunity for itself, or direct such opportunity to any other Person.
Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, any amount not paid when due pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (and any amounts billed or otherwise invoiced or demanded and properly payable that are not paid within 45 days of such bill, invoice or other demand) shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 2%.

The requesting party shall bear all costs and expenses (including allocated costs of in-house counsel and other personnel) in connection therewith.
7.7
Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation.
(b) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, the other parties shall make available to such Indemnifying Party, upon written request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may reasonably be required in connection with such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate in such defense, settlement or compromise, or such prosecution, evaluation or pursuit, as the case may be.
(c) Without limiting any provision of this Section, each of the parties agrees to cooperate, and to cause each member of its respective Group to cooperate, with each other in the defense of any infringement or similar claim with respect any intellectual property and shall not claim to acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group to claim to acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any intellectual property of a third Person in a manner that would hamper or undermine the defense of such infringement or similar claim.
(d) The obligation of the parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this Section 7.7 is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate cooperation and shall include the obligation to provide as witnesses inventors and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of the witness could assert a possible business conflict (subject to the exception set forth in the first sentence of Section 7.7(a)).
(e) In connection with any matter contemplated by this Section 7.7, the parties will enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement so as to maintain to the extent
 
practicable any applicable attorney-client privilege or work product immunity of any member of any Group.
(a) Subject to Article VIII, each of NCR and Teradata, on behalf of itself and each member of its respective Group, agrees to hold, and to cause its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives to hold, in strict confidence, with at least the same degree of care that applies to NCR's confidential and proprietary information pursuant to policies in effect as of the Effective Time, all Information concerning each such other Group that is either in its possession (including Information in its possession prior to any of the date hereof, the Effective Time or the Distribution Date) or furnished by any such other Group or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives at any time pursuant to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise, and shall not use any such Information other than for such purposes as shall be expressly permitted hereunder or thereunder, except, in each case, to the extent that such Information has been (i) in the public domain through no fault of such party or any member of such Group or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives, (ii) later lawfully acquired from other sources by such party (or any member of such party's Group) which sources are not themselves bound by a confidentiality obligation), or (iii) independently generated without reference to any proprietary or confidential Information of the other party.
7.8

(b) Each party agrees not to release or disclose, or permit to be released or disclosed, any such Information to any other Person, except its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, counsel and other advisors and representatives who need to know such Information (who shall be advised of their obligations hereunder with respect to such Information), except in compliance with Section 7.9. Without limiting the foregoing, when any Information is no longer needed for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, each party will promptly after request of the other party either return to the other party all Information in a tangible form (including all copies thereof and all notes, extracts or summaries based thereon) or certify to the other party that it has destroyed such Information (and such copies thereof and such notes, extracts or summaries based thereon).
(c) Notwithstanding Section 7.9(a) or (b), any express provision of any Ancillary Agreement providing for a shorter or longer period of survival of confidentiality obligations shall be given effect.

Subject to the foregoing, the Person that received such request may thereafter disclose or provide Information to the extent required by such law (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful process or such Governmental Authority.

Protective Arrangements.
 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in any Ancillary Agreement, in a Schedule hereto or thereto or in Section 8.11, the procedures for discussion, negotiation and arbitration set forth in this Article VIII shall apply to all disputes, controversies or claims (whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise) that may arise out of or relate to, or arise under or in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including all actions taken in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby on or prior to the date hereof), or the commercial or economic relationship of the parties relating hereto or thereto, between or among any member of the NCR Group and the Teradata Group (collectively, the "Covered Matters"). Except as expressly set forth in any Ancillary Agreement or in a Schedule hereto or thereto (which shall govern to the extent, if any, set forth therein), ach party agrees on behalf of itself and each member of its respective Group that the procedures set forth in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in connection with any dispute, controversy or claim relating to any of the foregoing matters and irrevocably waives any right to commence any Action in or before any Governmental Authority, except as expressly provided in Sections 8.7(b) and 8.8 and except to the extent provided under the Arbitration Act in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards and/or to enforce arbitrability. Each party on behalf of itself and each member of its respective Group irrevocably waives any right to any trial by jury with respect to any claim, controversy or dispute set forth in the first sentence of this Section 8.1.
8.1
Agreement to Arbitrate.
(a) It is the intent of the parties to use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve expeditiously any dispute, controversy or claim between or among them with respect to the matters covered hereby that may arise from time to time on a mutually acceptable negotiated basis. In furtherance of the foregoing, any party involved in a dispute, controversy or claim may (but shall not be required to) deliver a notice (an "Escalation Notice") demanding an in person meeting involving representatives of the parties at a senior level of management of the parties (or if the parties agree, of the appropriate strategic business unit or division within such entity). A copy of any such Escalation Notice shall be given to the General Counsel, or like officer or official, of each party involved in the dispute, controversy or claim (which copy shall state that it is an Escalation Notice pursuant to this Agreement). Any agenda, location or procedures for such discussions or negotiations between the parties may be established by the parties from time to time; , , that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to meet within 30 days of the Escalation Notice. Neither the decision not to deliver any Escalation Notice nor the failure of the parties to meet or to resolve any dispute, controversy or claim within such 30 day period shall limit any other right of any party hereunder, including any right to demand mediation and arbitration.
8.2
Escalation.
provided
however
(b) At any time and in any event at least 45 days prior to the delivery of an Arbitration Demand Notice pursuant to Section 8.3, either party may deliver a notice to the other party requesting mediation of any dispute, controversy or claim that may arise out of or relate to, or arise under or in connection with any Covered Matter (a "Mediation Notice"). In such event, the parties shall retain a mediator to aid the parties in their discussions and negotiations by informally providing advice to the parties. The mediator may be chosen from a list of mediators
 
candidates previously selected by the parties or by other agreement of the parties. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on a mediator within 15 days after delivery of a Mediation Notice, either party may request that JAMS appoint an independent mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals located in New York, NY. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS panel of neutrals, and in promptly scheduling the mediation proceedings. Any opinion expressed by the mediator shall be strictly advisory and shall not be binding on the parties, nor shall any opinion expressed by the mediator be admissible in any arbitration proceedings. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, subject to protections afforded to compromise discussions under Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and applicable state and local law corollaries, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days of delivery of a Mediation Notice (or such later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), the administration of the arbitration, if any, may proceed forthwith. The mediation may continue, if all the parties so agree, after the appointment of the arbitrator. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as arbitrator in the case. The pendency of a mediation shall not preclude a party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of the arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the parties agree not to defend against any application for provisional relief on the ground that a mediation is pending. Costs of the mediation shall be borne equally by the parties involved in the matter, except that each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. Mediation is a prerequisite to a demand for arbitration under Section 8.3 and no such demand may be made until at least 45 days after delivery of a Mediation Notice with respect to the applicable matter.
(a) At any time after 45 days after the delivery of a Mediation Notice (as applicable, the "Arbitration Demand Date"), any party involved in the dispute, controversy or claim (regardless of whether such party delivered the Mediation Notice) may, unless the Applicable Deadline has occurred, make a written demand (the "Arbitration Demand Notice") that the dispute be resolved by binding arbitration, which Arbitration Demand Notice shall be given to the parties to the dispute, controversy or claim in the manner set forth in Section 11.5. In the event that any party shall deliver an Arbitration Demand Notice to another party, such other party may itself deliver an Arbitration Demand Notice to such first party with respect to any related dispute, controversy or claim with respect to which the Applicable Deadline has not passed without the requirement of delivering a Mediation Notice. No party may assert that the failure to resolve any matter during any discussions, negotiations or mediation, the course of conduct during the discussions, negotiations or mediation or the failure to agree on a mutually acceptable time, agenda, location or procedures for the meeting, in each case, as contemplated by Section 8.2, is a prerequisite to a demand for arbitration under Section 8.3.
8.3
Demand for Arbitration.
(b) Except as may be expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, any Arbitration Demand Notice may be given until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations under applicable law (as applicable and as it may in a particular case be specifically extended by the parties in writing, the "Applicable Deadline"). Any discussions, negotiations or
 
mediations between the parties pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise will not toll the Applicable Deadline unless expressly agreed in writing by the parties. Each of the parties agrees on behalf of itself and each member of its Group that if an Arbitration Demand Notice with respect to a dispute, controversy or claim is not given prior to the expiration of the Applicable Deadline, as between or among the parties and the members of their Groups, such dispute, controversy or claim will be barred. Subject to Sections 8.7(d) and 8.8, upon delivery of an Arbitration Demand Notice pursuant to Section 8.3(a) prior to the Applicable Deadline, the dispute, controversy or claim shall be decided by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules set forth in this Article VIII.
(a) Within 15 days after a valid Arbitration Demand Notice is given, the parties involved in the dispute, controversy or claim referenced therein shall attempt to select as a sole arbitrator either an individual from a list previously agreed to by the parties or a retired judge from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York satisfactory to all such parties.
8.4
Arbitrators.
(b) In the event that such parties are not able jointly to select a sole arbitrator within such 15-day period, any party may request that JAMS appoint an independent retired judge from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as a sole arbitrator. In the event that JAMS is unable to appoint such an individual as an arbitrator within a 15-day period after any such request, JAMS shall appoint an independent arbitrator from its New York panel of neutrals.
(c) Any arbitrator selected pursuant to this Section 8.4 shall be disinterested with respect to any of the parties and the matter and shall be reasonably competent in the applicable subject matter.
(d) The sole arbitrator selected pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above will set a time for the hearing of the matter which will commence no later than 90 days after the date of appointment of the sole arbitrator and which hearing will be no longer than 30 days (unless (I) in the judgment of the arbitrator the matter is unusually complex and sophisticated and thereby requires a longer time, in which event such hearing shall be no longer than 90 days or (II) the parties involved in the arbitration agree in writing to a different time frame for the hearing). The final decision of such arbitrator will be rendered in writing to the parties not later than 60 days after the last hearing date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
(e) The place of any arbitration hereunder will be New York, New York, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
Within the time period specified in Section 8.4(d), the matter shall be presented to the arbitrator at a hearing by means of written submissions of memoranda and verified witness statements, filed simultaneously, and responses, if necessary in the judgment of the arbitrator or both the parties. If the arbitrator deems it to be advisable to a fair resolution of the dispute, live cross-examination or direct examination may be permitted. The arbitrator shall actively manage the arbitration with a view to achieving a just, speedy and cost-effective resolution of the dispute, claim or controversy. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, set time and other limits on the presentation of each party's case, its memoranda or
8.5
Hearings.
 
other submissions, and refuse to receive any proffered evidence, which the arbitrator, in his or her discretion, finds to be cumulative, unnecessary, irrelevant or of low probative nature. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any arbitration hereunder will be conducted in accordance with the JAMS Rules for Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then prevailing (except that the arbitration will not be conducted under the auspices of JAMS and the fee schedule of JAMS will not apply, unless the parties involved in the arbitration otherwise agree in writing). Except as expressly set forth in Section 8.8(b), the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be had and will be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction over the parties. Arbitration awards will bear interest at an annual rate of the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum commencing on the 30
th
day after the date of the issuance of the award. To the extent that the provisions of this Agreement and the prevailing rules of the JAMS conflict, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.
(a) Any party involved in the applicable dispute may request discovery in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. The arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the production of documents or testimony relevant to the dispute, controversy or claim and may limit discovery in his or her discretion, or upon motion by a party with an opportunity to be heard by any other parties.
8.6
Discovery and Certain Other Matters.
(b) The arbitrator shall have full power and authority to determine issues of arbitrability but shall otherwise be limited to interpreting or construing the applicable provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and will have no authority or power to limit, expand, alter, amend, modify, revoke or suspend any condition or provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; it being understood, however, that the arbitrator will have full authority to implement the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and to fashion appropriate remedies for breaches of this Agreement (including interim or permanent injunctive relief); that the arbitrator shall not have (i) any authority in excess of the authority a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the controversy or dispute would have absent these arbitration provisions or (ii) any right or power to award any incidental, indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages. (unless the same are expressly provided for in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, whether in provisions for indemnification or otherwise) that the limitation in this clause (ii) shall not apply to an Indemnitor's indemnification obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement with respect to any Liability any Indemnitee may have to any third party not affiliated with any member of the NCR Group or the Teradata Group for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages. It is the intention of the parties that in rendering a decision the arbitrator give effect to the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and follow applicable law (it being understood and agreed that this sentence shall not give rise to a right of judicial review of the arbitrator's award).
provided
provided however
(c) If a party fails or refuses to appear at and participate in an arbitration hearing after due notice, the arbitrator may hear and determine the controversy upon evidence produced by the appearing party.
(d) Arbitration costs and arbitrator compensation will be borne equally by each party involved in the matter, except that each party will be responsible for its own
 
attorney's fees and other costs and expenses, including the costs of witnesses selected by such party.
(a) Unless either party shall, prior to the closing of the arbitration hearing, request a supplemental written opinion, which the arbitrator in his or her discretion may grant or refuse, any arbitration award shall be a bare award limited to a holding for or against a party and shall be without findings as to facts, issues or conclusions of law (including with respect to any matters relating to the validity or infringement of patents or patent applications) and shall be without a statement of the reasoning on which the award rests, but must be in adequate form so that a judgment of a court may be entered thereupon. Judgment upon any arbitration award hereunder may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. To the extent that a supplemental written opinion is requested as set forth above and is provided by the arbitrator, then such shall be separate and apart from the remainder of the bare arbitration award itself, and shall not be considered part of the award and shall be deemed merely advisory unless the amount of the award exceeds $25 million and further judicial review of the award is sought as set forth below in this Article.
8.7 Certain Additional Matters.
(b) Prior to the time at which an arbitrator is appointed pursuant to Section 8.4, any party may seek one or more temporary restraining orders in a court of competent jurisdiction if necessary in order to preserve and protect the status quo. Neither the request for, or grant or denial of, any such temporary restraining order shall be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein and the arbitrator may dissolve, continue or modify any such order. Any such temporary restraining order shall remain in effect until the first to occur of the expiration of the order in accordance with its terms or the dissolution thereof by the arbitrator.
(c) Except as required by law, the parties shall hold, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives to hold, the existence, content and result of any mediations and arbitrations hereunder in confidence in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII, except as may be required in order to challenge, enforce or seek other judicial review of any award. Each of the parties shall request that any mediator or arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement.
(d) In the event that at any time the sole arbitrator shall fail to serve as an arbitrator for any reason, the parties shall select a new arbitrator who shall be disinterested as to the parties and the matter in accordance with the procedures set forth herein for the selection of the initial arbitrator. The extent, if any, to which testimony previously given shall be repeated or as to which the replacement arbitrator elects to rely on the stenographic record (if there is one) of such testimony shall be determined by the replacement arbitrator.
(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that any party reasonably determines the amount in controversy in any dispute, controversy or claim (or any series of related disputes, controversies or claims) under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement is, or is reasonably likely to be, in excess of $25 million and if such party desires to commence an Action in lieu of complying with the arbitration provisions of this Article, such party shall so state in its Arbitration Demand Notice. If the other parties to the arbitration do not agree that the amount in controversy in such dispute, controversy
8.8
Limited Court Actions.
 
or claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) is, or is reasonably likely to be, in excess of $25 million, the arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 8.4 hereof shall decide whether the amount in controversy in such dispute, controversy or claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) is, or is reasonably likely to be, in excess of $25 million. The arbitrator shall set a date that is no later than ten days after the date of his or her appointment for submissions by the parties with respect to such issue. There shall not be any discovery in connection with such issue. The arbitrator shall render his or her decision on such issue within five days of such date so set by the arbitrator. In the event that the arbitrator determines that the amount in controversy in such dispute, controversy or claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) is or is reasonably likely to be in excess of $25 million, any party to the arbitration may elect, within 30 days after such determination by the arbitrator, in lieu of arbitration, to commence an Action with respect to such dispute, controversy or claim (or such series of related disputes, controversies or claims) in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator does not so determine, or if a party does not elect to initiate an Action within 30 days after such determination by the arbitrator, the provisions of this Article (including with respect to time periods) shall apply as if no determinations were sought or made pursuant to this Section 8.8(a). All Applicable Deadlines shall be tolled from the date of submission of the Arbitration Demand Notice under this Section 8.8(a), until and through the close of the thirtieth day after the Arbitrator's determination under this Section 8.8(a).
(b) In the event that an arbitration award in excess of $25 million is issued in any arbitration proceeding commenced hereunder, any party may, within 60 days after the date of such award, submit the dispute, controversy or claim (or series of related disputes, controversies or claims) giving rise thereto to a court of competent jurisdiction, regardless of whether such party or any other party sought to commence an Action in lieu of proceeding with arbitration in accordance with Section 8.8(a). In such event, the applicable court may elect to rely on the record developed in the arbitration or, if it determines that it would be advisable in connection with the matter, allow the parties to seek additional discovery and/or to present additional evidence. Each party shall be entitled to present arguments to the court with respect to whether any such additional discovery and/or evidence shall be permitted and with respect to all other matters relating to the applicable dispute, controversy or claim (or series of related disputes, controversies or claims). Provided review is sought within such 60-day period, all Applicable Deadlines shall be deemed to have been tolled as of the initial submission of the Arbitration Demand Notice under Section 8.3.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the parties will continue to provide service and honor all other commitments under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement during the course of dispute resolution pursuant to the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to all matters not subject to such dispute, controversy or claim.
8.9
Continuity of Service and Performance.
The interpretation of the provisions of this Article, only insofar as they relate to the agreement to arbitrate and any procedures pursuant thereto, shall be governed by the Arbitration Act and other applicable federal law. In all other respects, the interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed as set forth in Section 11.2.
8.10
Law Governing Arbitration Procedures.
 
The provisions of this Article VIII shall not apply to disputes, claims or controversies relating to Taxes other than High-Level Disputes (as defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement) to which it shall apply, to the extent and subject to the terms and conditions of the Tax Sharing Agreement.
8.11
Applicability to High-Level Disputes.
(a) In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
9.1
Further Assurances.
(b) Without limiting the foregoing, prior to, on and after the Effective Time, each party hereto shall cooperate with the other parties, and without any further consideration, but at the expense of the requesting party, to execute and deliver, or use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and to make all filings with, and to obtain all consents, approvals or authorizations of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument (including any Consents or Governmental Approvals), and to take all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to take by any other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transfers of the Teradata Assets and the assignment and assumption of the Teradata Liabilities and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Without limiting the foregoing, each party will, at the reasonable request, cost and expense of any other party, take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to vest in such other party good and marketable title, free and clear of any Security Interest, if and to the extent it is practicable to do so.
