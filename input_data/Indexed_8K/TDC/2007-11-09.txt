On September 30, 2007, NCR Corporation (NCR) completed the separation of its Teradata data warehousing business through a distribution of 100% of the common stock of Teradata Corporation (the "Company") to holders of NCR common stock (the "Separation"). In contemplation of the Separation, NCR submitted a private letter ruling request to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concerning the Company's ability to continue to amortize (and deduct) for income tax purposes certain research and development costs that had been capitalized by NCR for tax purposes under Section 59(e) of the Internal Revenue Code subsequent to the transfer of the related intellectual property to the Company. In August 2007, NCR was notified that the IRS would likely issue an adverse ruling on its request. Based on this notification, the Company believed that the related deferred tax asset may not have met the criteria for recognition under FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), , related to the transferred tax basis, which would have resulted in a charge of approximately $144 million at September 30, 2007 ($150 million at June 30, 2007). In October 2007, based on the Company's technical analysis and considering the estimated amounts of possible outcomes, management determined that $124 million of the related deferred tax asset met the criteria for recognition under FIN 48 and, therefore, included a $20 million charge in its October 30, 2007 third quarter earnings press release to reduce the carrying value of the related deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2007. Subsequently, the Company was notified that the IRS had reconsidered its initial determination and was prepared to issue a favorable ruling. Accordingly, management believes that a charge is no longer necessary with respect to this matter and has revised its previously reported results for the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2007 to reflect 100% recognition of the related deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2007. However, until the issuance of a written favorable ruling by the IRS, there can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately realize this deferred tax asset.
