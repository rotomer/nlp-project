The actions described below were taken by resolutions approved by the members of the Committee who are each considered an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Committee also approved performance measures to be considered, along with other factors, if any, deemed to be appropriate by the Committee, in exercising downward discretion to determine the amount of the annual incentive opportunity awards, if any, that will be paid to the Company's executive officers under the MIP in respect of fiscal year 2008 performance (the "2008 Annual Awards").
