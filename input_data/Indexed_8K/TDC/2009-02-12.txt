Due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economic environment and its potential impact on Teradata's current and potential customers, the company will not provide specific revenue or earnings guidance for 2009 at this time. Despite this limited visibility, the company is providing the following information regarding its expected 2009 results: In addition to the headwind created by the economic environment, Teradata expects approximately 4 percentage points of negative impact from currency translation on its reported revenue and a corresponding currency impact on operating income, based on currency rates as of February 9, 2009. Teradata expects its Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expense to be flat to down from 2008 while absorbing the incremental expense associated with the company's initiative to increase the number of sales territories. Research and development (R&D) expense is expected to increase from the R&D expense incurred in 2008 to a level less than the R&D expense reported in 2007. Teradata expects its effective tax rate in 2009 to be 26 to 27 percent.
