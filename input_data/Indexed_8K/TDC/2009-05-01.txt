(e) At its meeting on April 27, 2009, the Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Teradata Corporation ("Teradata" or the "Company") made the following adjustments to the performance-based restricted stock unit awards for the October 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 performance period (the "PBRSU Awards"): (i) the Committee increased the cumulative net operating profit ("CNOP") target performance level for these awards by $44.4 million; and (ii) when determining achievement of performance against objectives under the PBRSU Awards, the Committee agreed that a positive adjustment of $44.4 million be applied to the actual CNOP results for the performance period. The Committee approved these adjustments to account for the Company's actual over-performance of its CNOP goals during the first three quarters of 2007 while it was a division of NCR Corporation ("NCR"). The PBRSU Awards were granted to a number of Teradata's management at the time of the spin off from NCR, including the following named executive officers of the Company: Michael Koehler, Robert Fair, Daniel Harrington, and Bruce Langos. The awards were granted by Teradata to these officers in substitution for similar awards that were originally granted by NCR on March 1, 2007, for the performance period from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
