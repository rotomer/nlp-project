Gross margin in the first quarter was 54.5 percent versus 51.7 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Gross margin in the first quarter increased 280 basis points, with both product and services gross margins improving from the prior year period.

Teradata reported first-quarter net income of $45 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, which compared to net income of $42 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.
"With constant currency revenue growth, meaningful margin improvement, and a 13% increase in operating income in the first quarter, Teradata is off to a good start for 2009," said
 
 
Mike Koehler, president and chief executive officer of Teradata Corporation. "I am pleased with our performance in both generating revenue and managing costs in this difficult economy.

Regional Operating Segment Results

Gross margin in the Americas region in the quarter was 57.1 percent, compared to 54.3 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Gross margin in the quarter was higher due to improved service margins.
Revenue in Teradata's EMEA region in the first quarter of 2009 was $97 million, down 6 percent from $103 million generated in the first quarter of 2008. Revenue increased 12 percent, when adjusting for currency translation, which negatively impacted revenue growth in the EMEA region by 18 percentage points.

Gross margin in the EMEA region in the quarter was 54.6 percent, versus 50.5 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Gross margin in EMEA improved in the first quarter of 2009 driven equally by higher product and service margins.
Teradata generated $65 million of revenue in its APJ region in the quarter, a 5 percent increase from $62 million in the first quarter of 2008. Revenue growth in the APJ region was 9 percent, when adjusted for 4 percentage points of negative impact from currency translation.

Gross margin in the APJ region in the quarter was 46.2 percent, compared to 45.2 percent in the first quarter of 2008. Gross margin in the APJ region improved in the quarter due to the increased proportion of product revenues as compared to services revenues.
Operating Income
First-quarter operating income of $60 million improved from $53 million reported in the first quarter of 2008, despite higher research and development expense, and incremental investment in new sales territories. Currency translation as well as lower discretionary expense, from items such as travel and the cancellation of the company's annual sales incentive and kick-off meetings, contributed to the favorable results.
Other Items
"Other Income" declined $3 million from the first quarter of 2008. Interest income was negatively impacted by the current lower interest rate environment, despite Teradata having a $232 million higher cash and short-term investment balance than at the end of the first quarter of 2008.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 was 25.0 percent, the same as in the prior year period.
Cash Flow
During the first quarter of 2009, Teradata generated $165 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $143 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2009 and 2008 were $20 million. Teradata generated $145 million of free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software)

in the first quarter of 2009, versus generating $123 million in the same period in 2008.
 
 
Balance Sheet
Teradata ended the first quarter of 2009 with $571 million in cash and short term investments, a $129 million increase from December 31, 2008. The company used approximately $20 million of cash to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares during the first quarter of 2009. As announced in a separate press release today, Teradata's Board of Directors authorized an additional $300 million to purchase shares under the Company's general open market share repurchase program. At the time of this extension, there was approximately $65 million remaining of the initial $250 million authorization.
Although Teradata has $300 million of funds available through a pre-arranged credit facility, there was no short- or long-term debt outstanding as of March 31, 2009.

For Release on May 7, 2009
 Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC), the world's largest company solely focused on data warehousing and enterprise analytics, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $300 million increase to its general open market share repurchase program. The program, established in February 2008, has also been extended for an additional two-year period expiring in February 2012. As of May 6, 2009, the Company had purchased about 9 million shares of its common stock, spending approximately $185 million of the original $250 million authorized under this program. The Company also has an ongoing anti-dilution offset repurchase program under which it repurchases common stock with cash received from employee stock purchases and option exercises under the Company's stock plans.
MIAMISBURG, Ohio
"This additional $300 million stock repurchase authorization reflects our continued confidence in Teradata's ability to generate attractive cash from operations well in excess of our capital needs to invest in the future growth of our business and strategic opportunities," said Steve Scheppmann, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Teradata. "Teradata's strong financial position, with no debt and increasing cash from operations, affords us the opportunity to drive incremental shareholder returns through share-repurchase activity."
The stock will be repurchased periodically on an ongoing basis in open market transactions at management's discretion, in accordance with applicable securities rules regarding issuer repurchases.
