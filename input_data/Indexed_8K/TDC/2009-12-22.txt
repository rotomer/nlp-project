Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On December 19, 2009, Peter L. Fiore, a member of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Teradata Corporation ("Teradata"), died at his home in Massachusetts, at the age of 52. Mr. Fiore served as a director since July 2008 and also served as a member of the Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee").
Because of these unfortunate circumstances, the size of Teradata's Board is being reduced from nine to eight, and the size of Class II of the Board will be reduced to consist of two directorships. The Board is also temporarily waiving the requirement under the Compensation Committee's Charter to have three directors on that committee, and will reconsider Board committee assignments at its next regularly scheduled meeting in February 2010.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
