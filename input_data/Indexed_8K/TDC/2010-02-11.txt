Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 56.0 percent versus 54.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. The gross margin improvement was driven by the Americas region, which saw a more favorable deal mix as compared to the prior-year period. Gross margin for full year 2009 was 54.9 percent, up a full point from 53.9 percent in 2008. The increase in gross margin for the full year was driven primarily by improvements in consulting services, which benefited from increased utilization of internal consulting resources, along with a continued focus on operational efficiencies and leverage.
Teradata reported fourth-quarter net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $84 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, which compared to GAAP net
 
 
income of $79 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.

In 2008, Teradata reported GAAP net income of $250 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, which included $3 million ($2 million after-tax) of impairment charges to write down the value of a historical equity investment and a $3 million charge to reflect an adjustment to tax expense based on the Company's 2007 US federal tax return. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings for full-year 2009 was $1.48 per diluted share, compared to $1.42 per diluted share in 2008.

 For the full year, revenue in the Americas region was $981 million in 2009 compared to $984 million in 2008. The full-year revenue comparison in the Americas was not significantly affected by currency translation.
 
 
Gross margin in the Americas region in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 60.7 percent, compared to 57.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin in the quarter was higher due to the impact of a favorable deal mix on product gross margin and improvements in consulting services margin as compared to the prior year. Gross margin in the Americas region for full year 2009 was 58.1 percent, compared to 56.6 percent in 2008. For the year, gross margin in the Americas was higher due to improved consulting and product margins.
Revenue in Teradata's EMEA region in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $106 million, down 7 percent from $114 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Currency translation benefited the revenue comparison in the EMEA region by 7 percentage points.

Gross margin in the EMEA region in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 51.9 percent compared to 51.8 percent reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin of 53.5 percent for full year 2009 compared favorably to 51.9 percent in 2008, driven by improved consulting margins.
Teradata generated $90 million of revenue in its APJ region in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 4 percent decrease from $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The revenue comparison in the APJ region was benefited by 5 percentage points from currency translation.

For the full year 2009, revenue in the APJ region declined 9 percent to $298 million. Currency translation provided 1 percentage point of benefit in the full-year revenue comparison.
(

Gross margin in the APJ region in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 45.6 percent, compared to 50.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margin declined in the quarter due to lower service margins and the impact of lower product revenue volume compared to the prior year period. Gross margin in the APJ region for full year 2009 declined to 46.3 percent from 48.3 percent in 2008, due primarily to the impact of lower product revenue.
 
 
Operating Income
Fourth-quarter operating income of $106 million improved from $102 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. In the quarter, favorable gross margin and higher revenue more than offset slightly higher selling, general and administrative expense and higher research and development expense. Full-year operating income was $338 million in 2009, versus $333 million in 2008. For the full year, higher gross margin and lower selling, general and administrative expense more than offset the effect of lower revenue and higher research and development expense.
Other Items
Lower interest income, due to the current lower interest rate environment, was offset by other expense in the fourth quarter of 2009. "Other Expense" for the full year was $4 million, versus $5 million of "Other Income" in 2008. The year-over-year change was largely due to the lower interest rate environment. Teradata incurred similar write-downs of historical equity investments in both years.
The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 21 percent, which compared to a 23 percent tax rate in the prior year period. The effective income tax rate for the full year 2009 was 24 percent, versus the 2008 tax rate of 26 percent.

 in the fourth quarter of 2009, versus generating $105 million in the same period in 2008.
