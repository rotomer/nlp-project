 Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC), the world's largest company solely focused on data warehousing and enterprise analytics, today reported revenue of $429 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 17 percent from $367 million in 2009.
ATLANTA
The first quarter revenue comparison included 5 percentage points of benefit from currency fluctuations.
(1)
Gross margin in the first quarter improved to 55.0 percent versus 54.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009, due to higher services gross margin and a more favorable mix of product versus service revenue.
Teradata reported first-quarter net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $67 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, which compared to GAAP net income of $45 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009.
"Teradata started off strong in 2010, delivering record first quarter revenue and earnings for our shareholders," said Mike Koehler, president and chief executive officer of Teradata Corporation. "All regions grew product revenue by double digits in the quarter.
"As a result, we are raising our guidance for full-year 2010 revenue growth to 8-10 percent and earnings per share to $1.60 to $1.70.
 
"The Teradata team executed well in the first quarter, released new models for three members of our purpose-built platform family, launched new offers with key partners, grew our consulting business and increased operating margins," said Koehler.
Regional Operating Segment Results
Teradata reports its results in three regional operating segments.
Teradata generated $252 million of revenue in its Americas region in the first quarter of 2010, up 23 percent from $205 million in the first quarter of 2009. Currency translation benefited revenue growth in the Americas by 2 percentage points in the first quarter.
(1)
Gross margin in the Americas region in the first quarter of 2010 improved to 57.9 percent, compared to 57.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Gross margin in the quarter improved largely due to higher consulting services margins compared to the prior year period.
Revenue in Teradata's EMEA region in the first quarter of 2010 was $106 million, up 9 percent from $97 million generated in the first quarter of 2009. Currency translation benefited the revenue comparison in the EMEA region by 6 percentage points.
(1)
Gross margin in the EMEA region in the first quarter of 2010 was 53.8 percent, down from 54.6 percent in the first quarter of 2009, due to the impact of lower product margins compared to the prior year period.
Teradata generated $71 million of revenue in its APJ region in the first quarter of 2010, a 9 percent increase from $65 million in the first quarter of 2009. The revenue comparison in the APJ region was benefited by 10 percentage points from currency translation.
(1)
Gross margin in the APJ region in the first quarter of 2010 was 46.5 percent, versus 46.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009.
Operating Income
First-quarter operating income of $86 million improved from $60 million reported in the first quarter of 2009, driven by higher revenue and a more favorable mix of product versus services revenue.
 
Other Items
Included in Teradata's quarterly results was $5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, or approximately 2 cents of earnings per share, the same as in the prior year period.
The effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2010 was 22 percent, which compared to a 25 percent tax rate in the prior year period. The first quarter tax rate benefited from the previously disclosed recognition of certain foreign net operating loss carry-forwards resulting from an audit settlement in the first quarter of 2010.
Because more of Teradata's profit for the year is now expected to be generated in the United States, the company's tax rate for full-year 2010 is now expected to increase to the 25.5 to 26.5 percent range.
Cash Flow
During the first quarter of 2010, Teradata generated $138 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $165 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures in the first quarter of $21 million compared to $20 million in the first quarter of 2009. Teradata generated $117 million of free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software)
(2)
 in the first quarter of 2010, versus generating $145 million in the same period in 2009. The primary driver of the change in free cash flow was a higher accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2008 versus December 31, 2009.
 
 
Balance Sheet
Teradata ended the first quarter of 2010 with $712 million in cash and short-term investments, a $51 million increase from December 31, 2009, even though Teradata used approximately $70 million of cash to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2010.
Although Teradata has $300 million of funds available through a pre-arranged credit facility, there was no short- or long-term debt outstanding as of March 31, 2010.
2010 Outlook
Teradata is increasing its expectation for full-year 2010 revenue growth to 8-10 percent from the revenue it generated in 2009, and currency is expected to have minimal benefit in the year over year comparison. Teradata's original revenue growth guidance of 7-9 percent for 2010 had included 1-2 percentage points of benefit from currency translation.
Even though Teradata expects its full-year tax rate to be higher than originally anticipated, the company is increasing its earnings guidance for 2010 to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from the original guidance range of $1.54 to $1.64 per share.
