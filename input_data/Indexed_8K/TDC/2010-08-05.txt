Exhibit 99.1
 
For Release on August 5, 2010
 
 
 
 
 
 Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC), the world's largest company solely focused on data warehousing and enterprise analytics, today reported revenue of $470 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, an increase of 12 percent from $421 million in 2009.
ATLANTA
Overall, the company's second quarter year-over-year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, when compared to the second quarter of 2009.

Gross margin in the second quarter was 57.0 percent versus 55.3 percent in the second quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus service revenue more than offset lower service gross margin in the quarter.
Teradata reported second-quarter net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $74 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, which compared to GAAP net income of $62 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS was $0.46 in the second quarter of 2010, versus $0.38 in the second quarter of 2009.

"Teradata turned in its best second quarter ever, with solid revenue and EPS growth. Operating income, operating margin and gross margin rate were at the highest levels of any quarter in Teradata's history," said Mike Koehler, president and chief executive officer of Teradata Corporation.
 
"First half revenue growth of 14 percent, product revenue growth of 24 percent, and the highest number of new customer wins in five years are evidence of our leadership in the marketplace. In addition, the investments we have been making in our platform family, partners and sales territories were key contributors to our growth," said Koehler. "Given our first half performance, we now expect our revenue and EPS to be at the high end of our previous guidance ranges."
Regional Operating Segment Results
Teradata reports its results in three regional operating segments.
Teradata generated $281 million of revenue in its Americas region in the second quarter of 2010, up 23 percent from $229 million in the second quarter of 2009. Currency translation benefited the year-over-year revenue comparison in the Americas by 1 percentage point in the second quarter.
(2)
Gross margin in the Americas region in the second quarter of 2010 improved to 60.9 percent, compared to 58.1 percent in the second quarter of 2009. Gross margin in the quarter improved largely due to higher product gross margin, as well as a higher mix of product revenue versus services revenue, compared to the prior-year period.
Revenue in Teradata's EMEA region in the second quarter of 2010 was $108 million, down 8 percent from $118 million generated in the second quarter of 2009. Currency translation negatively impacted the revenue comparison in the EMEA region by 5 percentage points.
(2)
 
Gross margin in the EMEA region in the second quarter of 2010 was 52.8 percent, down from 54.2 percent in the second quarter of 2009, due to the impact of a lower proportion of product revenue (compared to services revenue), as well as lower services margins.
Teradata generated $81 million of revenue in its APJ region in the second quarter of 2010, a 9 percent increase from $74 million in the second quarter of 2009. The revenue comparison in the APJ region was benefited by 6 percentage points from currency translation.
(

Gross margin in the APJ region in the second quarter of 2010 was 49.4 percent, up from 48.6 percent in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by higher product margins and a greater proportion of product revenue (compared to services revenue).
Operating Income
Second-quarter operating income of $106 million improved from $84 million reported in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in operating income was largely due to revenue growth, particularly product revenue, as well as improved product margins, offset by higher research and development and selling expenses.
Operating margin reported in the second quarter was 22.6 percent, versus 20.0 percent in the second quarter of 2009.
Other Items
The effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 30 percent, which compared to a 26 percent tax rate in the prior-year period, driven by an overall proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax earnings.
Due to the expectation that a higher portion of Teradata's pre-tax income will be generated in the United States and the uncertainty surrounding the retroactive reinstatement in 2010 of the U.S. Federal Research & Development Tax Credit, we anticipate a potentially higher full-year effective tax rate for 2010 in the 2728% range.
Cash Flow
During the second quarter of 2010, Teradata generated $62 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $103 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million compared to $20 million in the second quarter of 2009. Teradata generated $39 million of free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software)
(3)
 in the second quarter of 2010, versus generating $83 million in the same period in 2009. In comparison to the prior-year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally due to expected lower collections of receivables.
During the first six months of 2010, Teradata generated $200 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $268 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures in the first half of 2010 were $44 million, compared to $40 million in the same period in 2009.
 
        During the first two quarters of 2010, Teradata generated $156 million of free cash flow, versus $228 million in the same period in 2009.
 
Balance Sheet
Teradata ended the second quarter of 2010 with $724 million in cash and short-term investments, a $12 million increase from March 31, 2010. Although Teradata has $300 million of funds available through a pre-arranged credit facility, there was no short- or long-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2010.
2010 Outlook
Teradata now expects full-year 2010 revenue growth to be at the "high-end" of its previous guidance range of 8 to 10 percent. Currency is not expected to materially impact the full-year, year-over-year revenue comparison.
Earnings per diluted share (EPS) is also expected at the "high-end" of the previous $1.60 to $1.70 guidance range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense for the year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be at the "high-end" of the $1.69 to $1.79 range.
