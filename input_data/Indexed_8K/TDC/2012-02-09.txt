Teradata Announces 2011 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Results
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) today reported revenue of $673 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 23 percent from $548 million in 2010.
ATLANTA
For the full-year 2011, revenue was $2.362 billion, a 22 percent increase from $1.936 billion in 2010. The fourth-quarter revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, while the full-year comparison was benefited by 3 percentage points.

Stock-based compensation expense and a number of special items (primarily acquisition-related) had a net impact of $46 million on Teradata's 2011 net income as reported under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 55.6 percent was roughly the same as the 55.7 percent reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the special items and stock-based compensation expense described in footnote #2 below,

)
fourth-quarter gross margin was 56.5 percent, an improvement from 55.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in non-GAAP gross margin resulted from a favorable deal mix and leverage from increased product revenue, as well as improved consulting margins as compared to the prior-year period. Gross margin for full year 2011 was 54.7 percent, versus 56.2 percent in 2010. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the special items described below, 2011 full-year non-GAAP gross margin was 55.9 percent, versus 56.4 percent for the full-year 2010. The decline in non-GAAP gross margin for the full year resulted from a higher mix of consulting revenue.
Teradata reported fourth-quarter net income under GAAP of $98 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, which compared to GAAP net income of $85 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, Teradata reported GAAP net income of $353 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, which compared to GAAP net income of $301 million or $1.77 per diluted share, for the full year 2010. Excluding stock compensation expense and the special items described below, non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $113 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, versus $90 million, or $0.53 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Full-year non-GAAP net income was $399 million, or $2.32 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $317 million, or $1.86 per diluted share in 2010.

"Teradata finished the year strong, resulting in our best quarter and best year ever. Both the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 were records for the company on a number of metrics including revenue growth rate, non-GAAP product gross margin and operating margin rates which resulted in 25 percent growth in non-GAAP earnings per share for both the quarter and the year. We also added the highest number of new customers for both a quarter and a year," said Mike Koehler, president and chief executive officer, Teradata Corporation.
"Many corporations have established analytics as a top priority over the past several years. However, faced with today's accelerating data volumes and new types of data, more corporations are coming to the realization that big data and analytics are much more challenging, and also an opportunity to gain competitive advantage from insights from new data sources such as mobile, sensors, and social networks. Teradata works closely with our customers to provide the optimal data strategy, architecture and technology necessary to manage these challenges, and cost effectively create new insights from all their data to win in the market place."

For the full year, revenue in the Americas region increased 23 percent to $1.436 billion in 2011, up from $1.166 billion in 2010.

For the full year 2011, revenue in the EMEA region increased 24 percent to $548 million. Currency translation did not impact the revenue comparison in EMEA for the quarter, but did benefit the annual comparison in EMEA by 6 percentage points.

Teradata generated $113 million of revenue in its APJ region in the fourth quarter of 2011, a 28 percent increase from $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Operating Income
Fourth-quarter operating income of $133 million increased from $117 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating income of $155 million increased 24 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010.

For both the quarter and full year, higher revenue more than offset the increased investment in selling expense and research and development expense.
Cash Flow
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Teradata generated $126 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $148 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter totaled $23 million compared to $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Balance Sheet
Teradata ended 2011 with $772 million in cash, an $81 million increase from September 30, 2011, and a $111 million decrease from December 31, 2010. During 2011, the company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $127 million.
As of December 31, 2011, Teradata had total debt of $300 million outstanding under a 5-year term loan. Additionally, Teradata has $300 million available through a pre-arranged credit facility; however no funds were drawn from the credit facility.
Share Repurchase Authorization
Teradata's Board of Directors has approved a new authorization to repurchase a total of $300 million of the company's shares under its general open market share repurchase program. The program, which was initially established in February 2008 and was set to expire on February 10, 2012, has been extended for an additional three-year period now expiring in February 2015. As of January 31, 2012, the Company had purchased a total of 18.2 million shares of its common stock investing approximately $475 million of the $550 million that was previously authorized under this program.
2012 Outlook
In 2012, Teradata expects revenue to increase approximately 10 to 12 percent from the revenue it generated in 2011. Teradata anticipates that currency translation will negatively impact the year-over-year revenue comparison by approximately 1 percentage point, based on currency rates on January 31, 2012.
GAAP earnings per share in 2012 is expected to be in the $2.27 to $2.37 range. Excluding special items associated with 2011 acquisitions (which include the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, estimated purchase accounting adjustments, and transaction and integration costs) as well as stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS for 2012 is expected to be in the $2.56 to $2.66 range.

In 2011, a number of special items were included in Teradata's results reported under GAAP. For the fourth quarter of 2011, Teradata's non-GAAP results as reported in this release included $6 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; $4 million of transaction, integration and reorganization costs; $2 million of acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments; and $10 million of stock-based compensation expense. For the full-year results for 2011, Teradata's non-GAAP results as reported in this release included $24 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; $25 million of transaction, integration and reorganization costs; $17 million of acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments; $28 million of gains on equity investments; and $35 million of stock-based compensation expense. Included in Teradata's 2010 results was $8 million of stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter and $26 million for the full-year.
The following tables reconcile Teradata's actual and projected results and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, under GAAP to the company's actual and projected non-GAAP results and EPS for the periods presented, which exclude certain items. Our management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross margin, operating income, net income and EPS, excluding certain items internally, to understand, manage and evaluate our business and support operating decisions. The company believes such non-GAAP financial measures (1) provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations, (2) are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations and results, that may be more easily compared to peer companies and allow investors a view to the company's operating results during the integration period of the acquisitions of Aprimo and Aster Data, (3) provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends, and (4) provide consistency and comparability with past reports and projections of future results.
