On June 15, 2012, Teradata Corporation ("Teradata") entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. and Citibank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, and the lenders party thereto (the "Revolving Credit Agreement").
The Revolving Credit Agreement provides that Teradata may borrow, during the five-year term of the agreement, on a revolving credit basis, up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $300 million. In addition, under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, Teradata from time to time and subject to certain conditions may increase the lending commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to an additional $200 million, to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Agreement are due and payable on June 15, 2017, unless extended by agreement of the parties for up to two additional one-year periods. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaces a similar revolving credit agreement in the same maximum principal amount entered into by Teradata in 2007, which agreement was terminated as of June 15, 2012.
The outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Agreement bears interest at a floating rate based upon, at Teradata's option, a negotiated base rate or a Eurodollar rate plus in each case a margin based on the leverage ratio of Teradata.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement are unsecured, but are guaranteed by certain of Teradata's material domestic subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, default provisions and affirmative and negative covenants including, among others, covenants regarding the maintenance of certain financial ratios, covenants relating to financial reporting, compliance with laws, subsidiary indebtedness, limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, sales of assets, mergers and other fundamental changes involving the company, asset sales, entry into certain restrictive agreements and investments.
Teradata has other relationships with the parties to the Revolving Credit Agreement, each of which also is a lender to Teradata with respect to a 2011 term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $300 million.
The foregoing description of the Revolving Credit Agreement is not complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Revolving Credit Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The disclosure set forth under Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Credit Extension, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Credit Extension.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF
 
 
 
 
 
 
SCHEDULE 1.01
In the normal course of business, the Borrower is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, claims and other matters, including those that relate to the environment, health and safety, employee benefits, export compliance, intellectual property, tax matters, and other regulatory compliance and general matters, including those described below. As a public company, the Borrower has certain disclosure obligations with respect to material legal proceedings as set forth in Item 103 of Regulation S-K. Currently, the Borrower is not subject to any such material legal proceedings; however, the following disclosure was included in the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed by Teradata Corporation (the "Company" or "Teradata") for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, to address certain matters that are still pending final resolution.
"The Company is subject to governmental investigations and requests for information from time to time. As previously reported prior to Teradata's separation from NCR Corporation ("NCR"), the United States Department of Justice is conducting an investigation regarding the propriety of the Company's arrangements or understandings with others in connection with certain federal contracts and the adequacy of certain disclosures related to such contracts. The investigation arises in connection with civil litigation in federal district court filed under the qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act against a number of information technology companies, including the Company. The complaints against the Company remain under seal. The Company has conducted its analysis of such claims focusing on the propriety of certain transactions under federal programs under which Teradata was a contractor. The Company has shared evidence with the Justice Department of questionable conduct that the Company uncovered, has cooperated with the Justice Department in its investigation, and is in settlement discussions with the government to resolve this matter.
A separate portion of the government's investigation relates to the adequacy of pricing disclosures made to the government in connection with negotiation of NCR's General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule as it relates to Teradata, prior to the Company's separation from NCR, and to whether certain subsequent price reductions were properly passed on to the government. Both NCR and the Company have participated in this aspect of the investigation, with respect to certain products and services of each, and each will assume financial responsibility for its own exposures, if any, without indemnification from the other. The Company has an accrual of approximately $3 million related to the current best estimate of probable liability relating to these matters. The Company believes the amounts provided in its financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The Company believes that there is not a reasonable possibility that the loss in respect of these contingent matters will materially exceed the liability reflected in the Company's financial statements, although there can be no assurance that this will in fact be the case."

This opinion is provided to you at the request of the Borrower pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v) of the Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated herein, capitalized definitional terms in this opinion have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.
In this capacity, I have examined the Loan Documents and have also examined originals, or copies identified to my satisfaction, of, among other things, certificates of incorporation and by-laws of each of the Loan Parties, records of meetings and unanimous written consents of directors of each Loan Party and such records, agreements and other instruments, and have made such inquiry as I have determined was relevant and necessary, in my judgment, to render the opinions expressed below. For purposes of such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all certificates and the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as original counterparts or as certified copies. I have also assumed that all documents examined by me and all signatures thereon (other than the signatures of officers of the Loan Parties) are genuine. In addition, I have assumed that the Lenders and the Administrative Agent have the power and authority to execute and deliver, and to perform and observe the provisions of, the Credit Agreement and have duly authorized, executed and delivered such Agreement, and that such Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Lenders, the other agents and the Administrative Agent.
Based upon the foregoing, it is my opinion that:
1. The Borrower and each Guarantor is a corporation duly and properly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party.

2. The execution and delivery by the Borrower and the Guarantors of the Loan Documents to which they are a party and the performance by the Borrower and the Guarantors of their respective obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings on the part of the Borrower and the Guarantors, are within their respective corporate powers and will not:
(a) require any consent of the Borrower's or any of the Guarantors' stockholders (other than any such consent as has already been given and remains in full force and effect);
(b) violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award binding on the Borrower or any Guarantor or (ii) the Borrower's or any Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement of which I am aware (including the Term Loan Agreement dated as of April 5, 2011 among Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto) and to which the Borrower or any Guarantor is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder or give rise to any right to accelerate or to require repayment, repurchase or redemption of any obligation under any such agreement; or
(c) result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the property of the Borrower or a Guarantor pursuant to the terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Borrower or any Guarantor.
3. The Loan Documents to which each of the Borrower and the Guarantors is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and the Guarantors.
4. To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or threatened against the Borrower or any Guarantor which (a) challenges the validity, or seeks to enjoin the consummation or performance of any Loan Document or (b) if adversely determined could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5. Neither the Borrower nor any Guarantor is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
This opinion is subject to the following further qualifications and exceptions:

(1) the effect of federal and state antitrust laws, or other state or federal laws governing restraints of trade or unfair competition;
(2) the effect of any city or county ordinances, codes, rules or regulations; and
(3) the effect of judicial decisions which may permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to modify the terms or the interpretation of the Loan Documents.
To the extent this opinion addresses or is based upon questions of fact, I have not made any independent investigation or verification other than as noted herein and I have relied as to factual matters upon the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in the Agreement. As used in this opinion, the terms "to my knowledge," "known to me" or any similar phrase means my actual knowledge and the conscious awareness of facts or other information of lawyers within the Borrower's in-house Law Department.
I am qualified to practice law in Commonwealth of Virginia, and admitted to practice as a non-Ohio attorney registered for corporate status in the State of Ohio. This opinion is limited to the laws of such States, the federal laws of the United States and the general corporate law of the State of Delaware regarding organization and authority in effect on the date hereof, and to the facts bearing on this opinion as they now exist, and no responsibility or undertaking is hereby assumed to advise you of any subsequent changes in such laws or in the applicability or effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
This opinion may be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and other agents and their participants, assignees and other transferees and by Thompson Hine LLP in rendering its opinion to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and other agents.

Based upon the foregoing, it is our opinion that:
1. Each of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower or a Guarantor is a party is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or such Guarantor and is enforceable against the Borrower or such Guarantor in accordance with its respective terms.
2. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any Guarantor, is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any Guarantor in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under the Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the Obligations, or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents, other than any disclosure filing by the Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission that may be required under the federal securities laws.
3. The making of the Loans to the Borrower and the application of the proceeds thereof in accordance with the terms of the Agreement will not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
4. The execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by the Borrower, and the borrowings thereunder, and the execution, delivery and performance of the Guaranty by each Guarantor and the incurrence by them of their obligations under the Guaranty will not violate any applicable Law of the State of New York or any applicable Law of the United States of America.
