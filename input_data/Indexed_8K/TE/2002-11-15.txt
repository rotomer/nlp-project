TECO Exhibit 99.1 ENERGY FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: NEWS MEDIA: LAURA PLUMB 813.228.1572 INVESTOR RELATIONS: MARK KANE 813.228.1772 INTERNET: WWW.TECOENERGY.COM TECO ENERGY REPORTS SALE OF $380 MILLION FIVE-YEAR NOTES NOVEMBER 15, 2002 - TAMPA, FLA. - TECO Energy, Inc. (NYSE: TE) today reported that it has agreed to sell a new series of five-year notes issued as part of its previously announced 2002 financing plan. The notes are being issued to refinance the $200-million principal amount of the company's 7% Remarketable or Redeemable Securities Due 2015 (the ROARS Notes), which TECO Energy will retire. The notes will be issued and sold to Credit Suisse First Boston who will resell them in a Rule 144A offering. The notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $380 million, will bear an interest rate of 10.5% per year, and were issued at 92.684% of par resulting in net proceeds of $352 million. The size of the offering was increased from the $240 million originally planned due to the market's acceptance of the notes. Senior Vice President Finance and CFO Gordon Gillette said, "This completes our financing plan for 2002. The increased size of the issuance improves our cash position as it allows us to pay down short-term debt previously drawn against our credit facility. With no significant debt maturities until 2007, we expect this to be the last TECO Energy debt offering for some time." The notes, which contain no restrictions on Tampa Electric's ability to issue additional debt, will also contain certain covenants that would become effective only in the event of certain credit rating downgrades. While the company does not expect these covenants to become effective, if they did, TECO Energy would be required to pass certain financial tests prior to making certain payments, including dividends, or to incur certain additional indebtedness. TECO Energy's current 2003 plan, which includes the dividend, shows that the company comfortably passes these tests, which would be required only in the event of a downgrade. The company had intended to complete an exchange of notes on terms that would qualify as a debt-for-debt exchange for accounting purposes, which would have allowed the company to amortize the repurchase premium over the life of the notes. The company has determined that the exchange of these notes will not qualify for such treatment; accordingly, the company will record a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002
for the repurchase premium, which otherwise would have been recognized over time, of approximately $34 million plus any fees paid to the purchaser of the ROARS Notes. At the same time, TECO Energy continues to make good progress on the sale of its coalbed methane gas properties and expects to close on the sale by the end of the fourth quarter. The gain expected on the sale of these properties is expected to more than offset the impact of the charge for the repurchase premium. Note: This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. These forward-looking statements include references to the company's business plan for 2002 and 2003. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward- looking statements include the following: energy price changes affecting TPS' merchant plants; TPS' ability to sell the output of the merchant plants operating or under construction at a premium to the forward curve prices and to obtain power contracts to reduce earnings volatility; TPS' settlement agreement with Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) becoming final; any unanticipated need for additional equity capital that might result from lower than expected cash flow or higher than projected capital requirements; TECO Energy's ability to successfully complete the monetization of its synthetic fuel and gasification facilities, the sale of gas properties and other actions identified in its new business plan; and TECO Energy's ability to maintain credit ratings sufficient to avoid posting letters of credit relating to its construction loans and to avoid providing additional assurances to counterparties. Others factors include: general economic conditions, particularly those in Tampa Electric's service area affecting energy sales; weather variations affecting energy sales and operating costs; potential competitive changes in the electric and gas industries, particularly in the area of retail competition; regulatory actions affecting Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas System or TECO Power Services; commodity price changes affecting the competitive positions of Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas System, as well as the margins at TECO Coalbed Methane and TECO Coal; changes in and compliance with environmental regulations that may impose additional costs or curtail some activities; TPS' ability to successfully construct, finance and operate its projects on schedule and within budget; the ability of TECO Energy's subsidiaries to operate equipment without undue accidents, breakdowns or failures; interest rates, credit ratings an other factors that could impact TECO Energy's ability to obtain access to sufficient capital on satisfactory terms; and TECO Coal's ability to successfully operate its synthetic fuel production facilities in a manner qualifying for Section 29 federal income tax credits, the use of which could be limited by taxable income or changes in law, regulation or administration. These factors and others are discussed more fully under "Investment Considerations" in the company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 8, 2002.

Exhibit 99.2 PURCHASE OF NOTES UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL In the event of any Change in Control (as defined below) and if the Notes are rated below BBB- (or an equivalent rating) by Standard & Poor's or below Baa3 (or an equivalent rating) by Moody's at such time, each Holder of a Note will have the right, at such Holder's option, subject to the terms and conditions of the indenture, to require TECO Energy (the "Company") to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes on a date selected by the Company that is no earlier than 60 days nor later than 90 days (the "Change in Control Purchase Date") after the mailing of written notice by the Company of the occurrence of such Change in Control, at a repurchase price payable in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued interest (including additional interest), if any, thereon to the Change in Control Purchase Date (the "Change in Control Purchase Price"). Within 30 days after the Change in Control, the Company is obligated to mail to each Holder of a Note a notice regarding the Change in Control, which notice shall state, among other things: - that a Change in Control has occurred and that each such Holder has the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at the Change in Control Purchase Price; - the Change in Control Purchase Price; - the Change in Control Purchase Date; - the name and address of the Paying Agent; and - the procedures that Holders must follow to cause the Notes to be repurchased. To exercise this right, a Holder must deliver a written notice (the "Change in Control Purchase Notice") to the Paying Agent at its corporate trust office in New York, New York, or any other office of the Paying Agent maintained for such purposes, not later than 30 days prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date. The Change in Control Purchase Notice shall state: - the portion of the principal amount of any Notes to be repurchased, which must be $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; 3
- that such Notes are to be repurchased by the Company pursuant to the applicable change-in-control provisions of the indenture; and - unless the Notes are represented by one or more global notes, the certificate numbers of the Notes to be repurchased. Any Change in Control Purchase Notice may be withdrawn by the Holder by a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Paying Agent not later than three Business Days prior to the Change in Control Purchase Date. The notice of withdrawal shall state the principal amount and, if applicable, the certificate numbers of the Notes as to which the withdrawal notice relates and the principal amount, if any, which remains subject to a Change in Control Purchase Notice. If a Note is represented by a global note, DTC or its nominee will be the holder of such Note and therefore will be the only entity that can require the Company to repurchase Notes upon a Change in Control. To obtain repayment with respect to such Note upon a Change in Control, the beneficial owner of such Note must provide to the broker or other entity through which it holds the beneficial interest in such Note (1) the Change in Control Purchase Notice signed by such beneficial owner, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States and (2) instructions to such broker or other entity to notify DTC of such beneficial owner's desire to cause the Company to repurchase such Notes. Such broker or other entity will provide to the Paying Agent (1) a Change in Control Purchase Notice received from such beneficial owner and (2) a certificate satisfactory to the Paying Agent from such broker or other entity that it represents such beneficial owner. Such broker or other entity will be responsible for disbursing any payments it receives upon the repurchase of such Notes by the Company. Payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price for a Note in registered, certificated form (a "Certificated Note") for which a Change in Control Purchase Notice has been delivered and not withdrawn is conditioned upon delivery of such Certificated Note (together with necessary endorsements) to the Paying Agent at its office in New York, New York, or any other office of the Paying Agent maintained for such purpose, at any time (whether prior to, on or after the Change in Control Purchase Date) after the delivery of such Change in Control Purchase Notice. Payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price for such Certificated Note will be made promptly following the later of the Change in Control Purchase Date and the time of delivery of such Certificated Note. If the Paying Agent holds, in accordance with the terms of the indenture, money sufficient to pay the Change in Control Purchase Price of a Note on the Business Day following the Change in Control Purchase Date for such Note, then, on and after such date, interest on such Note will cease to accrue, whether or not such Note is delivered to the Paying Agent, and all other rights of the Holder shall terminate (other than the right to receive the Change in Control Purchase Price upon delivery of the Note). Under the indenture, a "Change in Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: - the Company ceases to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the total voting power of all classes of Capital Stock then outstanding of Tampa Electric (whether arising from issuance of securities of the Company or Tampa Electric, any direct or indirect transfer of securities by the Company or Tampa Electric, any merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company or Tampa Electric or otherwise); - any "entity", "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as such term is used in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that a person or group shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all shares that such person or group has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of more than a majority of the Voting Stock of the Company; 4
- the Company consolidates with or merges into another Person, or any Person consolidates with or merges into the Company, in either event pursuant to a transaction in which the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company or such other Person is changed into or exchanged for cash, securities, or other property, other than any such transaction where (A) the outstanding Voting Stock of the Company is changed into or exchanged for, in whole or in part, Voting Stock of the surviving or transferee Person and (B) the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction retain or receive, directly or indirectly, substantially proportionate ownership of at least a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving or transferee Person immediately after such transaction; - the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than to an entity at least a majority of whose Voting Stock is owned, directly or indirectly, substantially proportionately by the holders of the Voting Stock of the Company; - during any period of up to 24 consecutive months, commencing after the date of issuance of the Notes, individuals who at the beginning of such 24-month period were directors of the Company shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board of directors of the Company, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date of issuance of the Notes, whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (other than the election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the directors of the Company) shall be, for purposes of this provision, considered as though such person were a member of the board as of the beginning of such period; or - the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the Company. The indenture requires the Company to comply with the provisions of Regulation 14E and any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act which may then be applicable in connection with any offer by the Company to purchase Notes at the option of Holders upon a Change in Control. The Change in Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Company and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change in Control purchase feature, however, is not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to accumulate shares of its common stock or to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer, solicitation or otherwise, or part of a plan by management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. Instead, the Change in Control purchase feature is a term contained in many similar debt offerings and the terms of such feature result from negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchaser. Management has no present intention to propose any anti-takeover measures although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. No Note may be repurchased by the Company as a result of a Change in Control if there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default described under "Events of Default" below (other than a default in the payment of the Change in Control Purchase Price with respect to the Notes). In addition, the Company's ability to purchase Notes may be limited by its financial resources and its inability to raise the required funds because of restrictions on issuance of securities contained in other contractual arrangements. The agreements governing the Company's other Indebtedness may contain prohibitions of certain events or provide that such events are events of default, including events that would constitute a Change in Control. In addition, the exercise by Holders of Notes of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes upon a Change in Control could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change in Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on the Company. 5
The definition of Change in Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise, established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of the sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS The indenture contains the covenants described below, which will apply only if either (a) the Notes are rated below BBB- (or an equivalent rating) by Standard & Poor's or below Baa3 (or an equivalent rating) by Moody's, or (b) the Notes are rated below the Special Ratings Trigger; provided, however, the condition of clause (b) shall not apply when the TECO Construction Undertakings have been discharged and the Company is no longer obligated with respect to Indebtedness (including guarantees) that requires the Company to deliver, when the Company's long-term unsecured indebtedness is rated below the Special Ratings Trigger, letters of credit in the aggregate face amount of $50,000,000 or more. Certain capitalized terms used below are defined under the heading "Certain Definitions" below. LIMITATION ON RESTRICTED PAYMENTS The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to: - declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on the Capital Stock of the Company to the direct or indirect holders of its Capital Stock (except dividends or distributions payable solely in its Non-Convertible Capital Stock or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Non-Convertible Capital Stock and except dividends or distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary); - purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Capital Stock of the Company; or - purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity or scheduled repayment thereof, any Subordinated Indebtedness, - make any Restricted Investment (any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasing, other acquisition or retirement, payments and other actions set forth in this and the preceding bullet points above being collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments"), if at the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment: (1) an Event of Default, or an event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom); or (2) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made since the issuance date of the Notes would exceed the sum (without duplication) of: (a) the difference of (i) Operating Cash Flow minus (ii) an amount equal to the product of (x) Consolidated Interest Expense multiplied by (y) 1.70, in each case for the period from the beginning of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the issuance date of the Notes to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending at least 45 days prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or, in case such difference shall be a deficit, minus 100% of the deficit), (b) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company from the issue or sale of or contribution with respect to its Capital Stock after the issuance date of the Notes (other than Capital Stock sold to a Subsidiary of the Company), (c) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the issuance date of the Notes is sold for cash or otherwise liquidated, redeemed or repaid for cash, the lesser of (i) the cash return of capital with respect to such Restricted Investment (less the cost of disposition, if any) and (ii) the initial amount of such Restricted Investment and (d) 100% of any dividends received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary after the issuance date of the Notes from an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company, to the extent that such dividends were not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income of the Company for such period. 6
The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: - dividends or other distributions paid in respect of any class of Capital Stock issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of any business or assets by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary where the dividends or other distributions with respect to such Capital Stock are payable solely from the net earnings of such business or assets; - any purchase or redemption of Capital Stock of the Company made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital Stock of the Company (other than Redeemable Stock or Exchangeable Stock); - dividends paid within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if at such date of declaration such dividends would have complied with this covenant; - payments made by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to an Unrestricted Subsidiary in satisfaction of obligations existing on the issuance date of the Notes. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN LIENS The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon or with respect to any of its property of any character, including without limitation any shares of Capital Stock of Tampa Electric, without making effective provision whereby the Notes shall be (so long as any such other creditor shall be so secured) equally and ratably secured. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to (a) Liens securing Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided that on the date such Liens are created, and after giving effect to such Indebtedness, the aggregate principal amount at maturity of all the secured Indebtedness of the Company at such date shall not exceed 5% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets, (b) Liens for taxes, pledges to secure workman's compensation, other statutory obligations and materialman's, mechanic's and similar liens and purchase money liens and (c) Liens incurred by Tampa Electric that are not prohibited by applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including without limitation the rules and regulations of the Florida Public Service Commission. LIMITATION ON INDEBTEDNESS The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, issue, create, assume, guarantee, incur or otherwise become liable for (collectively, "issue"), directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness, provided, however, that the Company may issue Indebtedness if the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the four consecutive fiscal quarters immediately preceding the issuance of such Indebtedness (as shown by a pro forma consolidated income statement of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the four most recent fiscal quarters ending at least 30 days prior to the issuance of such Indebtedness after giving effect to (1) the issuance of such Indebtedness and (if applicable) the application of the net proceeds thereof to refinance other Indebtedness as if such Indebtedness was issued at the beginning of the period, (2) the issuance and retirement of any other Indebtedness since the first day of the period as if such Indebtedness was issued or retired at the beginning of the period and (3) the acquisition or disposition of any company or business by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the first day of the period (including giving effect to the pro forma historical earnings and interest expense of such company or business), including any acquisition or disposition which will be consummated contemporaneously with the issuance of such Indebtedness, as if in each case such acquisition or disposition occurred at the beginning of the period) exceeds a ratio of 2.0 to 1.0. The foregoing limitation is subject to exceptions for: - Indebtedness of the Company under Credit Facilities not to exceed $1,000,000,000 in aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time; 7
- Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in the first bullet above) outstanding on the issuance date of the Notes, and Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to refund or refinance, any Indebtedness permitted by this bullet; provided, however, that (i) the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued at a discount) of the Indebtedness so issued shall not exceed the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued at a discount) of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced and (ii) the Indebtedness so issued (A) shall not mature prior to the stated maturity of the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced, (B) shall have an Average Life equal to or greater than the remaining Average Life of the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced and (C) if the Indebtedness to be exchanged, refunded or refinanced is subordinated to the Notes, the Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes in right of payment; - Indebtedness represented by the Notes and the Exchange Notes to be issued pursuant to the registration rights agreement; - Indebtedness of the Company owed to and held by a Restricted Subsidiary and Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to and held by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that in the case of Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owed to and held by a Restricted Subsidiary, (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary or (ii) any transfer of such Indebtedness (except to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed for these purposes to constitute the issuance of such Indebtedness by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be; - Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to refund or refinance, Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary issued in accordance with the first paragraph of this section above; provided, however, that (i) the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued at a discount) of the Indebtedness so issued shall not exceed the principal amount (or accreted value in the case of Indebtedness issued at a discount) of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest on, the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced and (ii) the Indebtedness so issued (A) shall not mature prior to the stated maturity of the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced, (B) shall have an Average Life equal to or greater than the remaining Average Life of the Indebtedness so exchanged, refunded or refinanced and (C) if the Indebtedness to be exchanged, refunded or refinanced is subordinated to the Notes, the Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes in right of payment; - Indebtedness of a Person existing at the time at which such Person became a Subsidiary and not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Subsidiary; - Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary represented by capital lease obligations or purchase money obligations; - Indebtedness of Tampa Electric that is not prohibited by applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including without limitation the rules and regulations of the Florida Public Service Commission; - Indebtedness for working capital of a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Tampa Electric) under Credit Facilities not to exceed $100,000,000 in aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time; and - Indebtedness issued by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries not to exceed $100,000,000 in aggregate outstanding principal amount at any time. 8
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause an Event of Default or an event that with notice or the passage of time or both would constitute an Event of Default; provided that in no event will any Restricted Subsidiary existing on the issuance date of the Notes or any substantial portion of any of such Restricted Subsidiary's businesses be transferred to or held by an Unrestricted Subsidiary. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary properly designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "--Limitation on Restricted Payments" or Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause an Event of Default or an event that with notice or the passage of time or both would constitute an Event of Default.
