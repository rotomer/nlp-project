The holders of the Offered Securities will be entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement of even date herewith between the Company and the Purchaser (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company agrees to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") registering the issuance of notes identical in all material respects to the Offered Securities except for the absence of transfer restrictions in exchange for the Offered Securities or the resale of the Offered Securities under the Securities Act. The Company hereby agrees with the Purchaser as follows: 2. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Purchaser that:

Such offering circular dated as of the date hereof, as supplemented as of the date of this Agreement and including all material incorporated by reference therein, together with any other document approved in writing by the Company for use in connection with the contemplated resale of the Offered Securities, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Offering Document".

On its issue date, the Preliminary Offering Circular did not, and on the date of this Agreement, the Offering Document does not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Preliminary Offering Circular or the Offering Document based upon written information furnished to the Company by the Purchaser specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information is that described as such in Section 7(b). Except as disclosed in the Offering Document, on the date of this Agreement, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the Commission as supplemented by all subsequent reports (collectively, the "Exchange Act Reports") which have been filed by the Company with the Commission, does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Offering Document; each other subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated or formed, as the case may be, and is an existing corporation or other entity, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Offering Document, except where the failure of the foregoing to be correct would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and each subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or other entity in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of each subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and the capital stock or other equity interests of each subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free from liens, encumbrances and defects, except for such liens, encumbrances and defects as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any governmental agency or body or any court (including without limitation the Florida Public Service Commission) is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or under the Registration Rights Agreement or in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including without limitation in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company) or the Registration Rights Agreement, except for the order of the Commission declaring the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement (each as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) effective and except such as may be required under state securities laws and assuming the accuracy of the Purchaser's representations set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement, and the due performance by the Purchaser of its agreements as set forth in that Section, including the resale of the Offered Securities in conformity with such representations and agreements. 3
(f) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture, this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and compliance by the Company with the terms and provisions of the Indenture, this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Offered Securities will not result in a breach or violation by the Company of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default by the Company under, (A) any statute, rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its property or any Significant Subsidiary or any of their respective properties, (B) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is subject, except for breaches, violations or defaults that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect, or (C) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary; and the Company has full power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities as contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) Except as disclosed in the Offering Document, there are no pending actions, suits or proceedings against or involving the Company or any of its property, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, or would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Indenture, this Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement, or which are otherwise material in the context of the sale of the Offered Securities; and to the Company's knowledge, no such actions, suits or proceedings are threatened or contemplated.

Representations by Purchaser; Resale by Purchaser. (a) The Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act. (b) The Purchaser acknowledges that the Offered Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with 6
Regulation S or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Purchaser represents and agrees that it has offered and sold the Offered Securities, and will offer and sell the Offered Securities, only in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"). Accordingly, neither the Purchaser nor its affiliates, nor any persons acting on its or their behalf, have engaged or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Offered Securities, and the Purchaser, its affiliates and all persons acting on its or their behalf have complied and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S and Rule 144A.

Certain Agreements of the Company. The Company agrees with the Purchaser that: (a) The Company will advise the Purchaser promptly in writing of any proposal to amend or supplement the Offering Document and will not effect any such amendment or supplementation to which the Purchaser has reasonably objected in writing; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the Company's periodic filings with the Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act if filed after the completion of the resale of the Offered Securities. If, at any time prior to the completion of the resale of the Offered Securities by the Purchaser any event occurs as a result of which the Offering Document as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company promptly will notify the Purchaser of such event and will promptly prepare, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission. Neither the Purchaser's consent to, nor the Purchaser's delivery to offerees or investors of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof. (b) The Company will furnish to the Purchaser copies of the Offering Document and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as the Purchaser reasonably requests, and the Company will furnish to the Purchaser on the date hereof three copies of the Offering Document signed by a duly authorized officer of the Company.

not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request of holders and prospective purchasers of the Offered Securities, to such holders and purchasers, copies of the information required to be delivered to holders and prospective purchasers of the Offered Securities pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision thereto) in order to permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with resales by such holders of the Offered Securities. The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Purchaser all such documents. (c) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the Purchaser, to qualify the Offered Securities for sale and to determine their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Purchaser designates and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the resale of the Offered Securities by the Purchaser; provided, that the Company will not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. (d) During the period of five years after the date of this Agreement, the Company will furnish to the Purchaser as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to stockholders for such year; and the Company will furnish to the Purchaser (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report and any definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or mailed to stockholders, provided that, any such report or proxy statement shall be deemed to be furnished when posted electronically on a website designated by the Company to which the Purchaser has access, and (ii) from time to time, such other information concerning the Company as the Purchaser may reasonably request, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the right of the Company to withhold information if required by applicable law. (e) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will, upon request, furnish to the Purchaser and any holder of Offered Securities a copy of the restrictions on transfer applicable to the Offered Securities. (f) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to, resell any of the Offered Securities that have been reacquired by any of them. (g) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not be or become, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act. (h) The Company will pay all expenses incidental to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, 8
including (i) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and its professional advisers; (ii) all expenses in connection with the execution, issue, authentication, packaging and initial delivery of the Offered Securities, and, as applicable, the Exchange Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), the preparation and printing of this Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Offered Securities, the Indenture, the Preliminary Offering Circular, the Offering Document and any amendments and supplements thereto, and any other document relating to the issuance, offer, sale and delivery of the Offered Securities and, as applicable, the Exchange Securities (other than, in each case, the professional fees and expenses of counsel to the Purchaser except as provided below); (iii) any filing fees or other expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel to the Purchaser, which fees and disbursements shall not exceed $5,000) incurred in connection with qualification of the Offered Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Purchaser designates and the printing of memoranda relating thereto; (iv) any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities, (v) any expenses incurred in distributing the Preliminary Offering Circular and the Offering Document (including any amendments and supplements thereto) to the Purchaser, (vi) any travel expenses of the Purchaser and the Company's officers and employees, and any other expenses of the Purchaser and the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of Offered Securities, including without limitation, any expenses relating to the chartering of private aircraft, and (vii) the professional fees and expenses of counsel to the Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Exchange Agreement dated as of September 26, 2002 between the Company and the Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, in an amount not to exceed $65,000. (i) In connection with the offering, until the Purchaser shall have notified the Company of the completion of the resale of the Offered Securities, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has or will, either alone or with one or more other persons, bid for or purchase for any account in which it or any of its affiliates has a beneficial interest any Offered Securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any Offered Securities; and neither it nor any of its affiliates will make bids or purchases for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in, or of raising the price of, the Offered Securities. (j) The Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser for a period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Closing Date. The Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances where such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbor of Regulation S thereunder to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Offered Securities. 9

The obligation of the Purchaser to purchase and pay for the Offered Securities on the Closing Date will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent: (a) On or prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser shall have received a letter, dated the date of this Agreement, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP confirming that they are independent public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder (the "Rules and Regulations") and to the effect that: (i) in their opinion the financial statements and schedules and any summary of earnings examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related published Rules and Regulations; (ii) they have performed the procedures specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a review of interim financial information as described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71, Interim Financial Information, on the unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document; (iii) on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that: (A) the unaudited financial statements and any summary of earnings included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements and summary of earnings for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles; (B) if any unaudited "capsule" information is contained in the Offering Document, such information does not agree with the amounts set forth in the unaudited consolidated financial statements for those same periods or were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements; 10
(C) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there was any change in the capital stock or any increase in short-term indebtedness or long-term debt of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries or, at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, there was any increase in consolidated net current liabilities or any decrease in consolidated net current assets or net assets or stockholders' equity, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document; or (D) for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year, in consolidated net sales, net operating income, in the total or per share amounts of consolidated income before extraordinary items, net income or in the ratio of earnings to fixed charges; except in all cases set forth in clauses (C) and (D) above for changes, increases or decreases which the Offering Document discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and (iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter. (b) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole which, in the judgment of the Purchaser, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company, including the Offered Securities, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible 11

Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchaser specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; and, provided, further, that, this indemnity with respect to the Offering Document, the Preliminary Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto, shall not inure to the benefit of the Purchaser (or any person controlling the Purchaser) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Offered Securities that are the subject thereof to the extent such sale was an initial resale of the Securities if (i) the Purchaser did not send or deliver to such person a copy of the Offering Document (or the Offering Document, as amended or supplemented) (excluding delivery of documents incorporated therein by reference) at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the Offered Securities to such person (but only to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to arise out of the untrue statement or omission of a material fact that was corrected in the Offering Document (or the Offering Document, as amended or supplemented) that was not delivered by the Purchaser at or prior to confirmation of sale) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act, (ii) the Company has provided to the Purchaser sufficient quantities of the Offering Document (or the Offering Document, as amended or supplemented) in sufficient time to enable the Purchaser to deliver to such person a copy of the Offering Document (or the Offering Document, as amended or supplemented) in a timely manner, and (iii) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Offering Document, the Preliminary Offering Circular or any amendment or supplement thereto was corrected in the Offering Document (or the Offering Document, as amended or supplemented). (b) The Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or the Preliminary Offering Circular, or any amendment or supplement thereto or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Purchaser specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information 18
furnished by the Purchaser consists of the following information in the Offering Document: (i) the second sentence of the eighth paragraph under the caption "Plan of Distribution" and (ii) the ninth paragraph under the caption "Plan of Distribution". (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Purchaser from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue 19
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Purchaser and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), the Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which the Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each partner, director or officer of the Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls the Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Purchaser under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Purchaser may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 8. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Purchaser set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Purchaser is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Purchaser is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 6(b), the Company will reimburse the Purchaser for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by it in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. 9.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same agreement. 12. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS. 13.
