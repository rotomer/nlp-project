FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits. 10.1 Credit Agreement dated as of April 9, 2003, among TECO Energy, Inc., Merrill Lynch Bank USA, as Administrative Agent, and the Financial Institutions parties thereto. 99.1 Press Release dated April 11, 2003. ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE This information is being provided under Item 12 of Form 8-K, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition." In connection with information provided as part of a webcast presentation to financial analysts on April 11, 2003, the company identified for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003 cash from operations (CFO) of $110 million and asset sales of $80 million, for total CFO of $190 million. This liquidity outlook for the first quarter is based on TECO Energy's forecast of liquidity for those periods and does not reflect actual results. Actual first quarter results will be provided in the company's regular earnings release. The amounts shown do not represent a cash flow statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). They differ mainly in presentation from a GAAP cash flow statement (i) by showing amounts from asset sales as a separate line item rather than in their cash flow statement categories and (ii) for consistency with past liquidity information, by accounting for certain investments under the equity method rather than as consolidated operations, the net effect of which would not change cash availability. The complete slides used in the presentation can be found on the company's website at www.tecoenergy.com/pdf/ENte_041103.pdf.

THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") dated as of April 9, 2003, is entered into among TECO Energy, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Borrower"), MERRILL LYNCH BANK USA, as administrative agent for the Lenders ("Administrative Agent"), and the financial institutions listed on Schedule 1 or who later become a party hereto (the "Lenders"). RECITALS A. Borrower desires to obtain financing (i) to refinance Borrower's currently outstanding $350,000,000 term loan scheduled to mature on November 13, 2003 (the "Maturing Term Loan") and (ii) to the extent of up to $150,000,000, for general corporate purposes and, in connection therewith, has requested that the Lenders provide such financing to Borrower; and B. The Lenders are willing to provide to Borrower a $350,000,000 three hundred sixty-four (364) day multiple drawdown senior term credit facility (the "Facility") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. AGREEMENT NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements herein and in the other Credit Facility Documents and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein and therein, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS 1.1 DEFINITIONS. Except as otherwise expressly provided, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and its exhibits shall have the meanings given in Exhibit A. 1.2 RULES OF INTERPRETATION. Except as otherwise expressly provided, the Rules of Interpretation set forth in Exhibit A shall apply to this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents. ARTICLE II THE FACILITY 2.1 THE FACILITY. 2.1.1 Multiple Drawdown Term Credit Facility. 2.1.1.1 Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to make advances to Borrower from time to time prior to the Original Maturity Date (each, a "Loan") in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed such Lender's Commitment; provided that, the aggregate amount of A-2 Term Loans shall not exceed $150,000,000. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each Loan shall be funded by
the Lenders as described in Section 2.1.1.3. Amounts borrowed and repaid by Borrower hereunder may not be reborrowed. 2.1.1.2 Notice of Borrowing. Borrower shall request Loans by delivering to Administrative Agent a written notice in the form of Exhibit C-1, appropriately completed (a "Notice of Borrowing") which specifies, among other things: (a) the principal portion of the requested Borrowing which will bear interest as provided in (A) Section 2.1.3.1(a) (individually, a "Base Rate Loan") and (B) Section 2.1.3.1.(b) (individually, a "LIBOR Loan"); (b) the amount of the requested Borrowing, which shall be in the minimum amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (except in the case of a Loan of all remaining undrawn amounts under the Facility); (c) the date of the requested Borrowing, which shall be a Banking Day; and (d) the account(s) to which the proceeds of the Borrowing are to be deposited, as contemplated by Section 2.1.1.3(d); and (e) whether such Borrowing is an A-1 Term Loan or an A-2 Term Loan. Borrower shall deliver each such Notice of Borrowing so as to provide not less than the Minimum Notice Period. Any Notice of Borrowing may be modified or revoked by Borrower through the Banking Day prior to the applicable Minimum Notice Period, and thereafter shall be irrevocable. 2.1.1.3 Loan Funding. (a) Notice. The Notice of Borrowing shall be delivered to Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.1. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents of each Notice of Borrowing. (b) Pro Rata Loans. Each Loan shall be made on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Proportionate Shares, with each Borrowing to consist of a Loan by each Lender equal to such Lender's Proportionate Share of such Borrowing. (c) Lender Funding. Each Lender shall, before 12:00 noon in the case of LIBOR Loans and 2:00 p.m. in the case of Base Rate Loans, in each case, on the date of each Borrowing, make available to Administrative Agent at its office specified in Section 8.1, in same day funds, such Lender's Proportionate Share of such Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing. 2
(d) Funding of Loans. No later than 2:00 p.m. in the case of LIBOR Loans and 3:00 p.m. in the case of Base Rate Loans, in each case, on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing, if the applicable conditions precedent listed in Article III have been satisfied or waived and to the extent Administrative Agent shall have received the appropriate funds from the Lenders, Administrative Agent shall make available the Loans requested in such Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in immediately available funds, at its office specified in Section 8.1, and shall transfer such funds to the bank account(s) specified by Borrower in the Notice of Borrowing delivered in respect of such Borrowing. 2.1.2 [Intentionally Omitted]. 2.1.3 Interest Provisions Applicable to all Loans. 2.1.3.1 Loan Interest Rates. Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan from the date of such Loan until the maturity or prepayment thereof at one of the following rates per annum: (a) With respect to the principal portion of such Loan which is, and during such periods as such Loan is, a Base Rate Loan, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (such rate to change from time to time as the Base Rate shall change) plus the Applicable Margin. (b) With respect to the principal portion of such Loan which is, and during such periods as such Loan is, a LIBOR Loan, at a rate per annum during each Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. 2.1.3.2 Interest Provisions. Unless otherwise specified by Borrower in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion of Loan Type and except as otherwise provided for herein, all Loans shall be Base Rate Loans. Subject to the applicable limitations set forth herein, Loans shall bear interest based upon the LIBOR Rate as specified by Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion of Loan Type. Borrower shall not request, and the Lenders shall not be obligated to make, LIBOR Loans at any time an Inchoate Default or Event of Default exists. If an Event of Default exists at the end of an Interest Period, the LIBOR Loans whose Interest Period is then ending shall automatically convert to Base Rate Loans at such time (notwithstanding the delivery of a Confirmation of Interest Period Selection with respect to such Loans). 2.1.3.3 Interest Payment Dates. Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan (i) in the case of each Base Rate Loan, on the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) in the case of each LIBOR Loan, on the last day of each Interest Period related to each LIBOR Loan and, with respect to Interest Periods longer than three months, the last Banking Day of each calendar quarter, and (iii) in all cases, upon prepayment (to the extent thereof and including any optional prepayments), upon conversion from one Type of Loan to another Type and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). 3
2.1.3.4 Interest Periods. (a) Each Interest Period selected by Borrower for all LIBOR Loans shall be one, two, three or six months or such other period as close to six months as is practicable to enable Borrower to limit the number of LIBOR Loans as required by this Section 2.1.3.4(a) or to comply with clause (C) of the next sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the previous sentence, (A) any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a day which is not a Banking Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Banking Day unless such next Banking Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall end on the immediately preceding Banking Day; (B) any Interest Period which begins on the last Banking Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such Interest Period) shall end on the last Banking Day of the next calendar month; (C) the Interest Period for any Loan may not end after the Maturity Date; (D) Borrower may not at any time have outstanding more than five different Interest Periods relating to LIBOR Loans; and (E) LIBOR Loans for each Interest Period shall be in the amount of at least $1,000,000. (b) Borrower may contact Administrative Agent at any time prior to the end of an Interest Period for a quotation of interest rates in effect at such time for given Interest Periods, and Administrative Agent shall promptly provide such quotation. Borrower may select an Interest Period telephonically within the time periods specified in Section 2.1.1.2, which selection shall be irrevocable on and after commencement of the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Borrower shall confirm such telephonic notice to Administrative Agent by telecopy on the day such notice is given (in substantially the form of Exhibit C-3, a "Confirmation of Interest Period Selection"), and Administrative Agent shall promptly forward the same to the Lenders. Borrower shall promptly deliver to Administrative Agent the original of the Confirmation of Interest Period Selection initially delivered by telecopy. If Borrower fails to notify Administrative Agent of the next Interest Period for any LIBOR Loans in accordance with this Section 2.1.3.4(b), such Loans shall automatically convert to Base Rate Loans on the last day of the current Interest Period therefor. Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable (and, in any case, within two Banking Days after delivery of the Confirmation of Interest Period Selection) notify Borrower of each determination of the interest rate applicable to each Loan. 2.1.3.5 Interest Account and Interest Computations. Borrower authorizes Administrative Agent to record in an account or accounts maintained by Administrative Agent on its books (i) the interest rates applicable to all Loans and the effective dates of all changes thereto, (ii) the Interest Period for each LIBOR Loan, (iii) the date and amount of each principal and interest payment on each Loan and (iv) such other information as Administrative Agent may determine is necessary for the computation of interest payable by Borrower hereunder. Borrower agrees that all computations by Administrative Agent of interest shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. All computations of interest on Base Rate Loans shall be based upon a year of 365 or 366 days and the actual days elapsed since the last interest payment date, and shall be adjusted in accordance with any changes in the Base Rate to take effect on the beginning of the day of such change in the Base Rate. All computations of interest on LIBOR Loans shall be based upon a year of 360 days and the actual days elapsed. 4
2.1.4 Conversion of Loans. Borrower may convert any Loan from one Type of Loan to another Type; provided, however, that (i) any conversion of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans shall be made on, and only on, the first day after the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, and (ii) Loans shall be converted only in amounts of $10,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Borrower shall request such a conversion by a written notice to Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit C-2, appropriately completed (a "Notice of Conversion of Loan Type"), which specifies: (a) the Loans, or portion thereof, which are to be converted; (b) the Type into which such Loans, or portion thereof, are to be converted; (c) if such Loans are to be converted into LIBOR Loans, the initial Interest Period selected by Borrower for such Loans in accordance with Section 2.1.3.4(b); and (d) the date of the requested conversion, which shall be a Banking Day. Borrower shall give each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type to Administrative Agent so as to provide at least the applicable Minimum Notice Period. Any Notice of Conversion of Loan Type may be modified or revoked by Borrower through the Banking Day prior to the Minimum Notice Period, and shall thereafter be irrevocable. Each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type shall be delivered by first-class mail or telecopy to Administrative Agent at the office or to the telecopy number and as otherwise specified in Section 8.1; provided, however, that Borrower shall promptly deliver to Administrative Agent the original of any Notice of Conversion of Loan Type initially delivered by telecopy. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the contents of each Notice of Conversion of Loan Type. 2.1.5 Loan Principal Payment. On the Maturity Date, Borrower shall repay to Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans made by such Lender, with any remaining unpaid principal, interest, fees and costs due and payable on such date. From and after the Maturity Date, upon payment in full of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and all other amounts owed by Borrower to Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder and under the other Credit Facility Documents, the Lenders shall promptly mark any Notes cancelled and return such cancelled Notes to Borrower. 2.1.6 Promissory Notes. The obligation of Borrower to repay the Loans made by each Lender and to pay interest thereon at the rates provided herein shall, upon the written request of any Lender, be evidenced by Notes in the form of Exhibit B (each, a "Note"), each payable to the order of such Lender and in the principal amount of such Lender's Commitment. Borrower authorizes each Lender to record on the schedule annexed to such Lender's Note, and/or in such Lender's internal records, the date and amount of each Loan made by such Lender, and each payment or prepayment of principal thereunder and agrees that all such notations shall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters noted. Borrower further authorizes 5
each Lender to attach to and make a part of such Lender's Note continuations of the schedule attached thereto as necessary. No failure to make any such notations, nor any errors in making any such notations shall affect the validity of Borrower's obligation to repay the full unpaid principal amount of the Loans or the duties of Borrower hereunder or thereunder. 2.1.7 Prepayments. 2.1.7.1 Terms of all Prepayments. Upon the prepayment of any Loan, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender which made such Loan (i) all accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid and (ii) if such prepayment is the prepayment of a LIBOR Loan on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan, all Liquidation Costs incurred by such Lender as a result of such prepayment (pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8). Amounts prepaid may not be reborrowed. 2.1.7.2 Optional Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 2.1.7.1, Borrower may, at its option and without penalty, upon three Banking Days' notice to Administrative Agent, prepay any Loans in whole or in part in an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (except in the case of a prepayment of all the Loans). (b) Amounts to be applied in connection with any prepayments made pursuant to this Section 2.1.7.2 shall be applied, first, to the prepayment of the A-1 Term Loans until all such Loans have been paid in full and, second, to the prepayment of the A-2 Term Loans until all such Loans have been paid in full. 2.1.7.3 Mandatory Prepayment and Commitment Reductions. (a) Subject to Section 2.1.7.3(g), on the date of any Prepayment Event (any Prepayment Event of a type described in clause (ii) of the definition of such term which is effected pursuant to a definitive purchase and sale agreement that is subject only to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and that is executed prior to November 13, 2003 but that is closed on or after November 13, 2003 being deemed to have occurred prior to November 13, 2003), (i) with respect to any Prepayment Event occurring prior to November 13, 2003, if the sum of (x) the Net Cash Proceeds thereof and (y) the Net Cash Proceeds of all other Prepayment Events that shall have occurred on or prior to such date exceeds $350,000,000, an amount equal to such excess over $350,000,000 (after deducting from such amount the aggregate of the amounts, if any, previously so applied in accordance with this paragraph (i)) shall be applied to prepay the Loans and reduce the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3(f); and (ii) with respect to any Prepayment Event occurring on or after November 13, 2003, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied to prepay the Loans and reduce the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3(f). 6
(b) On the date of any Targeted Asset Sale Event, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied to prepay the Loans and reduce the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3(f). (c) On the date of any Refinancing Event, the Total Commitment shall be permanently reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds thereof. (d) On the date that is the earlier of (i) the date which is five Banking Days after Arranger has presented Borrower or any of its subsidiaries with a Proposed Financing and (ii) the date on which Borrower and its subsidiaries have provided notice to Arranger that it will not accept such Proposed Financing, an amount equal to the Net Cash Proceeds of such Proposed Financing shall be applied to prepay the Loans and reduce the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3(f). (e) If Borrower has exercised its option to extend the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.1.8, on the date that is 90 days prior to the Maturity Date, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate amount of prepayments and reductions in the Total Commitment, if any, necessary to cause the sum of the then outstanding Loans and the aggregate then unused amount of the Total Commitment to equal $200,000,000 over (ii) any then Available Anticipated Asset Sale Proceeds shall be applied to prepay the Loans and reduce the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3(f). (f) Amounts to be applied in connection with any prepayments or commitment reductions made pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of this Section 2.1.7.3 shall be applied as follows: first, to the prepayment of the A-1 Term Loans until such Loans have been paid in full; second, to reduce permanently the then unused amount of the Total Commitment to an amount which, when added to the aggregate amount of all A-2 Term Loans theretofore borrowed, does not exceed $150,000,000; third, to the prepayment of the A-2 Term Loans until such Loans have been paid in full; and fourth, to reduce permanently any remaining unused amount of the Total Commitment. (g) Anything in Section 2.1.7.3(a) to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time any prepayment and commitment reduction obligation pursuant such Section shall arise as a result of the Disposition of any asset (other than TECO Transport Corporation or the Hardee Power Plant) and the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with respect to the Disposition of TECO Transport Corporation or the Hardee Power Plant that is subject only to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, such prepayment and commitment reduction obligation shall be 7
reduced by an amount equal to the Available Anticipated Asset Sale Proceeds arising out of each such purchase and sale agreement. 2.1.8 Extension of Maturity Date. Borrower may request that the Maturity Date be extended by delivering to Administrative Agent at any time prior to the Original Maturity Date a written notice in the form of Exhibit C-4, appropriately completed (a "Notice of Extension"), which specifies the date to which the Maturity Date shall be extended, which date shall be no later than six months after the Original Maturity Date, and, unless an Event of Default or Inchoate Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Original Maturity Date, the Maturity Date shall be automatically extended to the date specified in the Notice of Extension. 2.2 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] 2.3 TOTAL COMMITMENT AND FEES. 2.3.1 Total Commitment. The aggregate principal amount of all Loans made by the Lenders shall not exceed $350,000,000, subject to (i) reductions by Borrower to a lower amount pursuant to Section 2.3.3 and (ii) additional reductions pursuant to Section 2.1.7.3 (as so reduced from time to time, the "Total Commitment"). 2.3.2 [Intentionally Omitted] 2.3.3 Optional Reductions and Cancellations. Borrower may, from time to time upon three Banking Days' written notice to Administrative Agent (who shall promptly deliver such notice to the Lenders), permanently reduce, by an amount of $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, or cancel in its entirety, the Total Commitment. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.3.3 to the contrary, Borrower may not reduce or cancel any portion of the Total Commitment if such reduction or cancellation would cause a violation of any provision of this Agreement or the other Credit Facility Documents. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent any Commitment Fee then due on such cancelled amount upon any such reduction or cancellation. From the effective date of any such reduction, the Commitment Fee shall be computed on the basis of the unused Total Commitment as so reduced. Once reduced or cancelled, the Total Commitment may not be increased or reinstated. Any reductions pursuant to this Section 2.3.3 shall be applied ratably to each Lender's respective Commitments in accordance with Section 2.6.1. 2.4 FEES 2.4.1 Commitment Fee. On the last Banking Day in each calendar quarter (where all or any portion of such calendar quarter occurs on or after the date hereof and prior to the Original Maturity Date) and on the Original Maturity Date (or, if the Total Commitment is cancelled prior to such date, on the date of such cancellation), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, accruing from the date hereof or the first day of such quarter, as the case may be, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") for such quarter (or portion thereof) then ending equal to 0.50% of the daily average unused portion of the Total Commitment during such quarter (or portion thereof) times a fraction, the numerator of 8
which is the number of days in such quarter (or portion thereof) and the denominator of which is 360. 2.5 OTHER PAYMENT TERMS. 2.5.1 Place and Manner. Borrower shall make all payments due to each Lender hereunder to Administrative Agent, for the account of such Lender, to Merrill Lynch Bank USA, ABA #124-084-669, Account Number: 62030, Ref: TECO Energy, in lawful money of the United States and in immediately available funds not later than 12:00 noon, on the date on which such payment is due. Any payment received after such time on any day shall be deemed received on the Banking Day after such payment is received. Administrative Agent shall disburse to each Lender each such payment received by Administrative Agent for such Lender, such disbursement to occur on the day such payment is received if received by 12:00 noon, otherwise on the next Banking Day. 2.5.2 Date. Whenever any payment due hereunder shall fall due on a day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Banking Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be, without duplication of any interest or fees so paid in the next subsequent calculation of interest or fees payable. 2.5.3 Late Payments. If any amounts required to be paid by Borrower under this Agreement or the other Credit Facility Documents (including principal or interest payable on any Loan, and any fees or other amounts otherwise payable to Administrative Agent or any Lender) remain unpaid after such overdue amounts are due, Borrower shall pay interest (including following any Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower) on the aggregate, outstanding balance of such amounts from the date due until those amounts are paid in full at a per annum rate equal to the Default Rate. 2.5.4 Net of Taxes, Etc. 2.5.4.1 Taxes. Subject to each Lender's compliance with Section 2.5.7, any and all payments to or for the benefit of Administrative Agent or any Lender by Borrower hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction, setoff or counterclaim of any kind whatsoever and in such amounts as may be necessary in order that all such payments, after deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto (excluding income and franchise taxes imposed on or measured by the net income, net profits or capital of Administrative Agent or such Lender by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein as a result of a connection between such Lender and such jurisdiction or political subdivision, unless such connection results solely from such Lender's executing, delivering or performing its obligations or receiving a payment under, or enforcing, this Agreement or any Note) (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"), shall be equal to the amounts otherwise specified to be paid under this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents. If Borrower shall be required by law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document to 9
Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.5.4), Administrative Agent or such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. In addition, Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp, recording or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (not including income or franchise taxes) that arise under the laws of the United States of America, the State of New York or the State of Florida from any payment made hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document or from the execution or delivery or otherwise with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes"). 2.5.4.2 Indemnity. Borrower shall indemnify each Lender for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.5.4) paid by any Lender, or any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted; provided that Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify any Lender for any penalties, interest or expenses relating to Taxes or Other Taxes arising from such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Lender agrees to give notice to Borrower of the assertion of any claim against such Lender relating to such Taxes or Other Taxes as promptly as is practicable after being notified of such assertion, and in no event later than 90 days after the principal officer of such Lender responsible for administering this Agreement obtains knowledge thereof; provided that any Lender's failure to notify Borrower of such assertion within such 90 day period shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation under this Section 2.5.4 with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses arising prior to the end of such period, but shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section 2.5.4 with respect to Taxes and Other Taxes, penalties, interest or expenses accruing between the end of such period and such time as Borrower receives notice from such Lender as provided herein. Payments by Borrower pursuant to this indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender makes written demand therefor (submitted through Administrative Agent), which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate describing in reasonable detail the basis thereof. 2.5.4.3 Receipts. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by Borrower, Borrower shall furnish to Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or if such receipt is not obtainable, other evidence of such payment by Borrower reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Borrower shall compensate each Lender for all reasonable losses and expenses sustained by such Lender as a result of any failure by Borrower to so furnish such copy of such receipt. 2.5.4.4 Conduits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.5.4, if a Lender is a conduit entity participating in a conduit financing arrangement (as defined in Section 7701(1) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder) then with respect to any payments made by Borrower under this Agreement or under any Note, 10
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay additional amounts to such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.5.4 to the extent that the amount of United States Taxes exceeds the amount that would have otherwise been payable if such Lender were not a conduit entity participating in a conduit financing arrangement. 2.5.4.5 Survival of Credit Facility Obligations. The obligations of Borrower under this Section 2.5.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations. 2.5.5 Application of Payments. Payments made under this Agreement or the other Credit Facility Documents shall (a) first be applied to any fees, costs, charges or expenses due and payable to Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder or under the other Credit Facility Documents, (b) next to any accrued but unpaid interest then due and owing, and (c) then to outstanding principal then due and payable or otherwise to be prepaid. 2.5.6 Failure to Pay Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower at least two Banking Days prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment in full, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment in full to Administrative Agent on such date and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to Administrative Agent, such Lender shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith upon demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for the first five days after such date, and subsequent thereto at the Base Rate. A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing by such Lender under this Section 2.5.6 shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. 2.5.7 Withholding Exemption Certificates. Each Lender that is not formed under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof upon becoming a Lender hereunder including any entity to which any Lender grants a participation or otherwise transfers its interest in this Agreement, agrees that it will deliver to Administrative Agent and Borrower two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each Lender which delivers to Borrower and Administrative Agent a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN pursuant to the preceding sentence further undertakes to deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent further copies of the said letter and Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification or procedure, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such letter or form expires or becomes obsolete or within a reasonable time after gaining knowledge of the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent letter and forms previously delivered by it to Borrower, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be requested by Borrower, certifying in the case of a Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless 11
in any such cases an event (including any change in any treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would reasonably prevent a Lender from duly completing and delivering any such letter or form with respect to it and such Lender advises Borrower that it is not capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax, and in the case of Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, establishing an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Borrower shall not be obligated, however, to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States Federal income tax pursuant to Section 2.5.4.1 (or make an indemnification payment pursuant to Section 2.5.4.2) to any Lender (including any entity to which any Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts (or such indemnification) would not have arisen but for a failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations under this Section 2.5.7. 2.6 PRO RATA TREATMENT. 2.6.1 Borrowings, Commitment Reductions, Etc. Except as otherwise provided herein, (a) each Borrowing and each reduction of the Total Commitment shall be made or allocated among the Lenders pro rata according to their respective Proportionate Shares, (b) each payment of principal and interest on the A-1 Term Loans shall be made pro rata among the holders of the A-1 Term Loans according to the respective principal amounts of the A-1 Term Loans held by them and each payment of principal and interest on the A-2 Term Loans shall be made pro rata among the holders of the A-2 Term Loans according to the respective principal amounts of the A-2 Term Loans held by them and (c) each payment of Commitment Fees shall be shared among the Lenders pro rata according to their respective Proportionate Shares. 2.6.2 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) hereunder in excess of its ratable share of payments in accordance with Section 2.6.1, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders to which such payments were required to be made such participations in the Loans as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from such Lender shall be rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such other Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (a) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to (b) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.6.2 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation. 12
2.7 CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. 2.7.1 Inability to Determine Rates. If, on or before the first day of any Interest Period for any LIBOR Loans, (a) Administrative Agent determines that the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period cannot be adequately and reasonably determined due to the unavailability of funds in or other circumstances affecting the London interbank market, or (b) Lenders holding aggregate Proportionate Shares of 33-1/3% or more shall advise Administrative Agent that (i) the rates of interest for such LIBOR Loans do not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans or (ii) deposits in Dollars in the London interbank market are not available to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by each such Lender in good faith in writing to Administrative Agent and to Borrower) in the ordinary course of business in sufficient amounts to make and/or maintain its LIBOR Loans, Administrative Agent shall immediately give notice of such condition to Borrower. After the giving of any such notice and until Administrative Agent shall otherwise notify Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such condition no longer exist, Borrower's right to request the making of or conversion to, and the Lenders' obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. Any LIBOR Loans outstanding at the commencement of any suspension shall be converted at the end of the then current Interest Period for such Loans into Base Rate Loans, as applicable, unless such suspension has then ended. 2.7.2 Illegality. If, after the date of this Agreement, the adoption of any Governmental Rule, any change in any Governmental Rule or the application or requirements thereof (whether such change occurs in accordance with the terms of such Governmental Rule as enacted, as a result of amendment, or otherwise), any change in the interpretation or administration of any Governmental Rule by any Governmental Authority, or compliance by any Lender or Borrower with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law, but if not having the force of law, being of the type with which a Lender customarily complies) of any Governmental Authority (a "Change of Law") shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan, such Lender shall immediately notify Administrative Agent and Borrower of such Change of Law. Upon receipt of such notice, (a) Borrower's right to request the making of or conversion to, and the Lenders' obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended for so long as such condition shall exist, and (b) Borrower shall, at the request of such Lender, either (i) pursuant to Section 2.1.4, convert any then outstanding LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans at the end of the current Interest Periods for such Loans, or (ii) immediately repay or convert (at Borrower's option) LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans if such Lender shall notify Borrower that such Lender may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such Loans as LIBOR Loans. Any conversion or prepayment of LIBOR Loans made pursuant to the preceding sentence prior to the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans shall be deemed a prepayment thereof for purposes of Section 2.8. 2.7.3 Increased Costs. If, after the date of this Agreement, any Change of Law: 2.7.3.1 Shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to any LIBOR Loan, or Commitment in respect thereof, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments by Borrower to any Lender on such a Loan or with respect to any such 13
Commitment (except for Taxes, Other Taxes or changes in the rate of taxation on the overall net income of any Lender); or 2.7.3.2 Shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (without duplication of any reserve requirement included within the applicable interest rate through the definition of "Reserve Requirement") against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any Lender for any LIBOR Loan; or 2.7.3.3 Shall impose on any Lender any other condition directly related to any LIBOR Loan or Commitment in respect thereof; and the effect of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, issuing, creating, renewing, participating in or maintaining any such LIBOR Loan or Commitment in respect thereof or to reduce any amount receivable by such Lender hereunder; then Borrower shall from time to time, within 30 days after demand by such Lender, pay to such Lender additional amounts sufficient to reimburse such Lender for such increased costs or to compensate such Lender for such reduced amounts. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such increased costs or reduced amounts and the basis for determination of such amount, submitted by such Lender to Borrower, shall, in the absence of demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of this Agreement. 2.7.4 Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that (a) any Change of Law after the date of this Agreement increases the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, or the Lending Office of such Lender or any Person controlling such Lender (a "Capital Adequacy Requirement"), and (b) the amount of capital maintained by such Lender or such Person which is attributable to or based upon the Loans, the Commitments or this Agreement must be increased as a result of such Capital Adequacy Requirement (taking into account such Lender's or such Person's policies with respect to capital adequacy), Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or such Person, within 30 days after demand of Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or such Person, such amounts as such Lender or such Person shall reasonably determine are necessary to compensate such Lender or such Person for the increased costs to such Lender or such Person of such increased capital. A certificate of such Lender or such Person, setting forth in reasonable detail the computation of any such increased costs, delivered to Borrower by Administrative Agent on behalf of such Lender or such Person shall, in the absence of demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on Borrower for purposes of this Agreement. 2.7.5 Notice; Participating Lenders' Rights. Each Lender shall notify Borrower of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.7, as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than 180 days after the principal officer of such Lender responsible for administering this Agreement obtained knowledge thereof; provided, however, that the failure to give Borrower notice within such 180 day period and to make such determination during such periods shall not relieve Borrower of the obligation under this Section 2.7 with respect to any claim arising prior to the end of such period, but shall relieve Borrower of its obligations under this Section 2.7 with respect to the time between the end of such period and such time as Borrower receives notice 14
from such Lender as provided herein. No Person purchasing from a Lender a participation in any Commitment (as opposed to an assignment) shall be entitled to any payment from or on behalf of Borrower pursuant to Section 2.7.3 or Section 2.7.4 which would be in excess of the applicable proportionate amount (based on the portion of the Commitments in which such Person is participating) which would then be payable to such Lender if such Lender had not sold a participation in that portion of the Commitment. 2.8 FUNDING LOSSES. If Borrower shall (a) repay or prepay any LIBOR Loans on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans, (b) fail to borrow any LIBOR Loans in accordance with a Notice of Borrowing delivered to Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any applicable conditions or otherwise) after such notice has become irrevocable, (c) fail to convert any Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans, as applicable, in accordance with a Notice of Conversion of Loan Type delivered to Administrative Agent (whether as a result of the failure to satisfy any applicable conditions or otherwise) after such notice has become irrevocable, (d) fail to continue a LIBOR Loan in accordance with a Confirmation of Interest Period Selection after such notice of confirmation has become irrevocable, or (e) fail to make any prepayment in accordance with any notice of prepayment delivered to Administrative Agent, Borrower shall, within 30 days after demand by any Lender, reimburse such Lender for all reasonable costs and losses incurred by such Lender ("Liquidation Costs") due to such payment, prepayment or failure. Borrower understands that such costs and losses may include losses incurred by a Lender as a result of funding and other contracts entered into by such Lender to fund LIBOR Loans (other than non-receipt of the Applicable Margin). Each Lender demanding payment under this Section 2.8 shall deliver to Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of costs and losses for which demand is made. Such a certificate so delivered to Borrower shall, in the absence of demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding as to the amount of such loss for purposes of this Agreement. 2.9 ALTERNATE OFFICE, MINIMIZATION OF COSTS. 2.9.1 Minimization of Costs. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternative Lending Office with respect to its LIBOR Loans and otherwise take any reasonable actions to reduce any liability of Borrower to any Lender under Sections 2.5.4, 2.7.3, 2.7.4 or 2.8, or to avoid the unavailability of any Type of Loans under Section 2.7.2 so long as (in the case of the designation of an alternative Lending Office) such Lender, in its sole discretion, does not determine that such designation is disadvantageous to such Lender. 2.9.2 Replacement Rights. If and with respect to each occasion that a Lender either makes a demand for compensation pursuant to Section 2.5.4, 2.7.3 or 2.7.4 or is unable for a period of three consecutive months to fund LIBOR Loans pursuant to Section 2.7.2 or such Lender wrongfully fails to fund a Loan, Borrower may, upon at least five Banking Days' prior irrevocable written notice to each of such Lenders and Administrative Agent, in whole permanently replace the Loans and Commitments of such Lender; provided that Borrower shall replace such Loans and Commitments with the Loans and Commitments of a lender reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. Such replacement Lender shall upon the effective date of replacement purchase the Obligations owed to such replaced Lender for the aggregate amount thereof and shall thereupon and for all purposes become a "Lender" hereunder. Such notice from Borrower shall specify an effective date for the replacement of such Lender's Loans and 15
Commitments, which date shall not be later than the 14th day after the day such notice is given. On the effective date of any replacement of such Lender's Loans and Commitments and Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.9.2, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender (a) any fees due to such Lender to the date of such replacement; (b) the principal of and accrued interest on the principal amount of outstanding Loans held by such Lender to the date of such replacement (such amount to be represented by the purchase of the Obligations of such replaced Lender by the replacing Lender and not as a prepayment of such Loans), and (c) the amount or amounts due to such Lender pursuant to each of Sections 2.5.4, 2.7.3 or 2.7.4, as applicable, and any other amount then payable hereunder to such Lenders. In addition, if the replacement Lender was not previously a "Lender" hereunder, Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent an administrative fee of $3,500. Borrower will remain liable to such replaced Lender for any Liquidation Costs that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of the purchase of such Lender's Loans (unless such Lender has defaulted on its obligation to fund a Loan hereunder). Upon the effective date of the purchase of any Lender's Loans and termination of such Lender's Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.7.2, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder. No such termination of such Lender's Commitments and the purchase of such Lender's Loans pursuant to this Section 2.7.2 shall affect (i) any liability or obligation of Borrower or any other Lender to such terminated Lender, or any liability or obligation of such terminated Lender to Borrower or any other Lender, which accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or (ii) such terminated Lender's rights hereunder in respect of any such liability or obligation. 2.9.3 Alternate Office. Any Lender may designate a Lending Office other than that set forth on Schedule 1, and may assign all of its interests under the Credit Facility Documents, and its Note, to such Lending Office, provided that such designation and assignment do not at the time of such designation and assignment increase the reasonably foreseeable liability of Borrower under Sections 2.5.4, 2.7.3 or 2.7.4, or make an interest rate option unavailable pursuant to Section 2.7.2. ARTICLE III CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 3.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE CLOSING DATE. The agreement of each Lender to make the initial Loan requested to be made by it hereunder is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions (unless waived in writing by Administrative Agent with the consent of the Lenders) on or prior to April 30, 2003: 3.1.1 Credit Facility Documents.

The obligation of the Lenders to make each Loan is subject to the prior satisfaction of each of the following conditions (unless waived by Administrative Agent with the consent of Lenders holding in excess of 50% of the Proportionate Shares in the Facility): 17
3.2.1 Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. Each representation and warranty set forth in Article IV shall be true and correct in all material respects as if made on and as of the date of such Borrowing before and after giving effect thereto and the application of the proceeds therefrom, unless such representation or warranty relates solely to another time, in which event such representation or warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such other time. 3.2.2 No Defaults.

ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Borrower makes the following representations and warranties to and in favor of Administrative Agent and the Lenders as of the Closing Date and, unless otherwise expressly limited to the Closing Date, as of the date of each Borrowing. All of these representations and warranties shall survive the Closing Date, the issuance of any Notes and the making of the Loans: 4.1 CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND BUSINESS. Borrower is a corporation duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such 18
qualification is necessary to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is or is to become a party. 4.2 POWER AND AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Borrower has full power and authority and the legal right to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is or is to become a party and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder. Borrower has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is or is to become a party to complete the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent or authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of any other Person or Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by Borrower, or the validity or enforceability as to Borrower, of this Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is or is to become a party, except such consents or authorizations or filings or other acts as have already been obtained or where the failure to obtain such consent or authorization could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. This Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which Borrower is a party have been duly executed and delivered by Borrower and constitute, and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is to become a party will upon execution and delivery thereof by Borrower and the other parties thereto (if any) constitutes, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower enforceable against it in accordance with its terms except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the right of creditors generally and by general principles of equity. 4.3 NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of this Agreement and each other Credit Facility Document to which it is or is to become a party to complete the transactions contemplated hereby and the making by Borrower of any payments hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document to which it is a party will not violate any applicable law or any material contractual obligation of Borrower and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the properties or revenues of Borrower pursuant to any applicable law or any such contractual obligation except, in each case, where such violation, creation or imposition could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. 4.4 NO PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION. No litigation or proceeding of or before any Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened in writing against Borrower, except where such litigation or proceeding could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. 4.5 GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS.

whether direct or contingent, and fairly presented in all material respects the financial condition of Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the case may be, in each case as of the date delivered and were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2002, there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations, property, assets or financial condition of Borrower and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole. 4.7 TRUE AND COMPLETE DISCLOSURE. All factual information heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by Borrower or its representatives in writing to Administrative Agent or any Lender for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated herein was true and accurate in all material respects on the date as of which such information was dated or certified and at such date did not omit to state any fact necessary to make such information not misleading at such time in light of the circumstances under which such information was provided. The information referred to in the immediately preceding sentence furnished to Administrative Agent or any Lender on or prior to the Closing Date, taken as a whole, as updated or supplemented from time to time prior to the Closing Date, is true and correct in all material respects as of the Closing Date, and as of the Closing Date all such information does not omit to state any fact which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. 4.8 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. Borrower is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended and is exempt from regulation under PUHCA and the Federal Power Act. 4.9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. There is no violation by Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary of any Governmental Rule which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. Except as have been delivered to Administrative Agent, no notices of violation of any Governmental Rule have been issued, entered or received by Borrower. 4.10 ERISA. Borrower and any other Person which is under common control (within the meaning of Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code) with Borrower have fulfilled their obligations (if any) under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code for each ERISA Plan in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and have not incurred any liability to the PBGC or an ERISA Plan under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums due in the ordinary course). Assuming that the credit extended hereunder does not involve the assets of any employee benefit plan subject to ERISA, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will involve a Prohibited Transaction. ARTICLE V COVENANTS OF BORROWER Borrower covenants and agrees that until the repayment in full of the Obligations (other than those contingent obligations that are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement or the other Credit Facility Documents) and the expiration and termination of all Commitments, unless Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders waive compliance in writing: 20

Such certificate shall not be qualified or limited because of restricted or limited examination by such accountant of any material portion of the records of Borrower. 5.9.3 Each time the financial statements are delivered under Sections 5.9.1 or 5.9.2, deliver, along with such financial statements, a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of Borrower (i) setting forth reasonably detailed calculations demonstrating compliance with Section 5.11 and including a schedule describing all Contingent Obligations of Borrower, and (ii) certifying that (A) such Responsible Officer has made or caused to be made a review of the transactions and financial condition of Borrower during the relevant fiscal period and that, to such Responsible Officer's knowledge, Borrower is in compliance with all applicable material provisions of each Credit Facility Document to which Borrower is a party or, if such is not the case, stating the nature of such non-compliance and the corrective actions which Borrower has taken or proposes to take with respect thereto, and (B) such financial statements are true and correct in all material respects and that no material adverse change in the consolidated assets, liabilities, operations, or financial condition of Borrower has occurred since the date of the immediately preceding financial statements provided to Administrative Agent or, if a material adverse change has occurred, the nature of such change. 5.9.4 As long as Borrower is required or permitted to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, a copy of its report on Form 10-K shall satisfy the requirements of Section 5.9.1 and a copy of Borrower's report on Form 10-Q shall satisfy the requirements of Section 5.9.2. 5.10 NOTICES. Borrower shall promptly, upon acquiring notice or giving notice, as the case may be, or obtaining knowledge thereof, deliver written notice to Administrative Agent of: 5.10.1 Any litigation pending or threatened in writing against Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary involving claims against Borrower or such Significant Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, such notice 23
to include copies of all papers filed in such litigation and to be given monthly if any such papers have been filed since the last notice given; 5.10.2 Any dispute or disputes which may exist between Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary and any Governmental Authority and which involve (i) claims against Borrower or such Significant Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, (ii) injunctive or declaratory relief that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, (iii) revocation or material modification or the like of any applicable material permit or imposition of additional material conditions with respect thereto, or (iv) any liens for any material amount of taxes due but not paid; 5.10.3 Any default under this Agreement or under any other agreement with respect to any Indebtedness of Borrower outstanding in an amount equal to or in excess of $50,000,000 or the acceleration of Indebtedness of Borrower for borrowed money in an amount equal to or in excess of $10,000,000; 5.10.4 Borrower being placed on watch or review for possible rating down-grade by S&P or Moody's; 5.10.5 Any negative change, from the date hereof, from the rating given to Borrower's long-term senior unsecured debt by either S&P or Moody's; and 5.10.6 Any event or circumstance which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. 5.11 FINANCIAL COVENANT. Borrower shall maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Total Debt to Capitalization, for the fiscal quarter then ended, of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1.00. 5.12 INDEMNIFICATION. 5.12.1 Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless Administrative Agent and its affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (Administrative Agent and each such person being an "Indemnitee") from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which such Indemnitee may become subject under any applicable federal, state or foreign law or otherwise, and related to, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the other Credit Facility Documents, and will reimburse any Indemnitee for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising therefrom, whether or not such Indemnitee is a party and whether or not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of Borrower. 5.12.2 The foregoing indemnity shall not apply with respect to any Indemnitee to the extent that any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense is found in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnitee's bad faith, gross 24
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower shall not be liable for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages suffered by an Indemnitee, including any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings of such Indemnitee, other than any such damages or losses imposed upon or asserted or awarded against any Indemnitee by a third party. 5.12.3 Upon receipt by an Indemnitee of actual notice of any action, claim, suit, investigation or proceeding (each, an "Action") against such Indemnitee with respect to which indemnity may be sought under this letter agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify Borrower in writing; provided, however, that failure so to notify Borrower shall not relieve Borrower from any liability which Borrower may have on account of this indemnity or otherwise, except to the extent Borrower is materially prejudiced by such failure. Borrower shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of any Action brought to enforce any claim or liability of any Indemnitee resulting from any such Action, and, if Borrower so elects, it shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Action at its expense, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnitee (in which case Borrower shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees, costs and expenses of any separate counsel retained by any Indemnitee). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in the defense of an Action, and Borrower shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (a) the use of counsel chosen by Borrower to represent the Indemnitee would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (b) such Indemnitee has reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; (c) Borrower shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the Indemnitee in the exercise of the Indemnitee's reasonable judgment to represent the Indemnitee, within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such Action; or (d) Borrower authorizes the Indemnitee to employ separate counsel at Borrower's expense. Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, in no event shall Borrower be responsible hereunder for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (together with appropriate local counsel, if any) for all Indemnitees in connection with an Action. 5.12.4 If the indemnification of an Indemnitee provided for in this Section 5.12 is for any reason unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnitee, then Borrower agrees to contribute to the aggregate amount of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by such Indemnitee, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits to Borrower, on the one hand, and such Indemnitee, on the other hand, from the matters contemplated by this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents or (ii) if (but only if) the allocation provided for in clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of Borrower, on the one hand, and such Indemnitee, on the other hand with respect to such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 5.12.5 Borrower agrees that, without Administrative Agent's prior written consent, it will not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification could be sought under 25
this Agreement (whether or not any Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each Indemnitee from all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnitee. 5.12.6 The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall survive the satisfaction or discharge of Borrower's obligations hereunder, and shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies of the Lenders. 5.12.7 Any amounts payable by Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be regularly payable within 30 days after Borrower receives an invoice for such amounts from any applicable Indemnitee, and if not paid within such 30-day period shall bear interest at the Default Rate. Upon payment of any claim by Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.12 or other similar indemnity provisions contained herein to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, Borrower, without any further action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have relating thereto, and such Indemnitee shall cooperate with Borrower and Borrower's insurance carrier, and give such further assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable Borrower vigorously to pursue such claims. 5.13 RESTRICTED PAYMENTS. If there are Loans then outstanding and the aggregate quarterly dividend payments on Borrower's common stock (based on the dividend rate then most recently approved by Borrower's board of directors) equal or exceed $40,000,000, Borrower may not declare or pay cash dividends with respect to its Equity Interests or make any other Restricted Payment unless prior to the declaration thereof Borrower delivers to Administrative Agent and Arranger liquidity projections satisfactory to them demonstrating that Borrower will have sufficient cash or cash equivalents (including any then Available Anticipated Asset Sale Proceeds) to make such Restricted Payment and each of the three quarterly dividends next scheduled to be paid on its common stock (based upon such then most recently approved dividend rate). 5.14 USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower shall use, and shall cause its subsidiaries to use, the proceeds of the Loans hereunder solely to refinance the Maturing Term Loan and for other general corporate purposes; provided that no more than $150,000,000 may be used for such other general corporate purposes. Each Loan the proceeds of which are used to refinance the Maturing Term Loan is herein called an "A-1 Term Loan," and each Loan the proceeds of which are used for such other general corporate purposes is herein called an "A-2 Term Loan." ARTICLE VI EVENTS OF DEFAULT; REMEDIES 6.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an event of default ("Event of Default") hereunder: 6.1.1 Payments. Borrower shall fail to pay, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (i) any principal on any Loan on the date such sum is due, (ii) any interest on any Loan or any scheduled fee, cost, charge or sum due hereunder or under any other Credit Facility 26
Document, within three Banking Days after the date that such sum is due, or (iii) any other fee, cost, charge or other sum due under this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document, within 30 days after written notice that such sum is due and has not been paid. 6.1.2 Debt Cross Default. (i) Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary shall default for a period beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of any principal, interest or other amount due under any agreement involving the borrowing of money or the advance of credit (other than trade payables or non-recourse indebtedness) and the outstanding amount or amounts payable under all such agreements equals or exceeds $50,000,000 or (ii) an event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under an agreement, or related agreements, under which Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary has outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money (other than non-recourse indebtedness) of $10,000,000 or more and, in the case of this clause (ii), such debt has been accelerated by the holder of such debt, or the holder of such debt has attempted to accelerate but such acceleration was prevented by applicable Governmental Rule. 6.1.3 Bankruptcy; Insolvency. Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary shall become subject to a Bankruptcy Event. 6.1.4 Misstatements; Omissions. Any representation or warranty of Borrower set forth in this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document shall be untrue or misleading in any material respect as of the time made and such untrue or misleading representation or warranty (i) is having or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower and (ii) shall remain unremedied by Borrower for a period of 30 days after the earlier of the date that Borrower becomes aware thereof or receives written notice thereof from Administrative Agent. 6.1.5 Breach of Terms of Agreement. Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement and (except with respect to any covenants set forth in Section 5.1 (with respect to its obligation to maintain its existence), 5.3, 5.8 or 5.11) such failure shall continue unremedied for 30 days after Borrower becomes aware thereof or receives written notice with respect thereto from Administrative Agent. 6.1.6 Judgments. A final judgment or judgments shall be entered against Borrower or any Significant Subsidiary in the amount of $50,000,000 or more (net of amounts covered by insurance) individually or in the aggregate (other than (i) a judgment which is fully discharged within 30 days after its entry, or (ii) a judgment, the execution of which is effectively stayed within 30 days after its entry but only for 30 days after the date on which such stay is terminated or expires) or, in the case of injunctive relief, which if left unstayed could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower. 6.1.7 Change in Control. Without the consent of the Majority Lenders, (i) any entity, person (within the meaning of Section 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) that theretofore was beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of less than 30% of Borrower's voting stock shall have acquired beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of voting stock of Borrower (or other securities convertible into such voting stock) representing 30 27
% or more of the combined voting power of all voting stock of Borrower; or (ii) during any period of up to 24 consecutive months, commencing after the date hereof, individuals who at the beginning of such 24-month period were directors of Borrower shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the board of directors of Borrower, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof, whose election, or nomination for election by Borrower's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved (other than the election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the directors of Borrower) shall be, for purposes of this provision, considered as though such person were a member of the board as of the beginning of such period. 6.1.8 ERISA Violations. If Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate should establish, maintain, contribute to or become obligated to contribute to any ERISA Plan and (a) a Reportable Event shall have occurred with respect to any ERISA Plan; or (b) a trustee shall be appointed by a United States District Court to administer any ERISA Plan; or (c) the PBGC shall institute proceedings to terminate any ERISA Plan; or (d) a complete or partial withdrawal by Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate from any Multiemployer Plan shall have occurred, or any Multiemployer Plan shall enter reorganization status, become insolvent, or terminate (or notify Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate of its intent to terminate) under Section 4041A of ERISA; or (e) any ERISA Plan experiences an accumulated funding deficiency under Code Section 412(b); or (f) Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate incurs any liability for a Prohibited Transaction under ERISA Section 502; provided that any of the events described in this Section 6.1.8 shall result in joint liability to Borrower and all ERISA Affiliates in excess of $5,000,000. 6.1.9 Security. Any of the Credit Facility Documents, once executed and delivered, shall, except as the result of acts or omissions of Administrative Agent or the Lenders, fail to provide Administrative Agent and the Lenders the liens, security interest, rights, titles, interest, remedies permitted by law, powers or privileges intended to be created thereby or cease to be in full force and effect (except as expressly contemplated by the terms thereof), or the validity thereof or the applicability thereof to the Loans or other obligations purported to be secured or guaranteed thereby or any part thereof shall be disaffirmed by or on behalf of Borrower or any other party thereto (other than Administrative Agent or the Lenders). 6.2 REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at the election of the Required Lenders, without further notice of default, presentment or demand for payment, protest or notice of nonpayment or dishonor, or other notices or demands of any kind, all such notices and demands other than notices required by this Agreement or any of the other Credit Facility Documents being waived (to the extent permitted by Governmental Rule), exercise any or all of the following rights and remedies, in any combination or order that the Required Lenders may elect, in addition to such other rights or remedies as the Lenders may have hereunder, under the other Credit Facility Documents or at law or in equity. 6.2.1 No Further Loans. Refuse, and Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall not be obligated, to continue any Loans or to make any additional Loans; provided that in the event of an Event of Default occurring under Section 6.1.3 of this Agreement with respect to 28
Borrower, the foregoing shall take effect immediately and without further act of Administrative Agent or the Lenders. 6.2.2 Cure by Administrative Agent. Without any obligation to do so but only during any time when a Loan is outstanding, or any other amounts are due and owing hereunder to Administrative Agent or the Lenders, Administrative Agent may make disbursements or Loans in respect of which any amounts are outstanding to or on behalf of Borrower to cure any Event of Default or Inchoate Default hereunder as the Required Lenders in their sole discretion may consider necessary or appropriate, whether to preserve and protect the Lenders' interests under this Agreement or any Credit Facility Documents or for any other reason, and all sums so expended, together with interest on such total amount at the Default Rate (but in no event shall the rate exceed the maximum lawful rate, if applicable), shall be repaid by Borrower to Administrative Agent on demand and shall be secured by this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents and shall constitute an Obligation, notwithstanding that such expenditures may, together with amounts advanced under this Agreement, exceed the amount of the Total Commitment. 6.2.3 Acceleration. Declare and make all sums of accrued and outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest remaining under this Agreement together with all unpaid fees, costs (including Liquidation Costs) and charges due hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document, immediately due and payable and require Borrower immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which Borrower hereby expressly waives, to pay Administrative Agent or the Lenders an amount in immediately available funds equal to the aggregate amount of any outstanding Loans; provided that in the event of an Event of Default occurring under Section 6.1.3 of this Agreement with respect to Borrower, all such amounts shall become immediately due and payable without further act of Administrative Agent or the Lenders. ARTICLE VII ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, SUBSTITUTION, AMENDMENTS, ETC. 7.1 APPOINTMENT, POWERS AND IMMUNITIES. 7.1.1 Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder and under the other Credit Facility Documents with such powers as are expressly delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any other Credit Facility Document, or be a trustee for any Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document or any Governmental Rule or exposes Administrative Agent to any liability. Each of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any of their respective Affiliates shall not be responsible to any other Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by Borrower or its Affiliates contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Administrative Agent, or any Lender under this Agreement, for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, 29
the Notes or any other document referred to or provided for herein or for any failure by Borrower, its respective Affiliates to perform their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder. Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys in fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys in fact selected by it with reasonable care. 7.1.2 Administrative Agent and its directors, officers, employees or agents shall not be responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Administrative Agent (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until Administrative Agent receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to Administrative Agent; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by them in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no warranty or representation to any Lender for any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Credit Facility Document; (d) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any Credit Facility Document on the part of any party thereto or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of Borrower or any other Person; and (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any Credit Facility Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto. Except as otherwise provided under this Agreement and the other Credit Facility Documents, Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to the Credit Facility Documents as shall be directed by the Majority Lenders or Required Lenders, as the case may be. 7.2 RELIANCE. Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any certificate, notice or other document (including any cable, telegram, telecopy or telex) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent. As to any other matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action or exercise any discretion, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting upon instructions of the Majority Lenders or Required Lenders, as the case may be, (except that Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement, any other Credit Facility Document or any Governmental Rule). Administrative Agent shall in all cases (including when any action by Administrative Agent alone is authorized hereunder, if Administrative Agent elects in its sole discretion to obtain instructions from the Majority Lenders or Required Lenders, as the case may be) be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, and such instructions of the Majority Lenders or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. 30
7.3 NON-RELIANCE. Each Lender represents that it has, independently and without reliance on Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of the financial condition and affairs of Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and agrees that it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. Each of Administrative Agent and any Lender shall not be required to keep informed as to the performance or observance by Borrower or its Affiliates under this Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or to make inquiry of, or to inspect the properties or books of Borrower or its Affiliates. 7.4 DEFAULTS. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Inchoate Default or Event of Default, unless such default relates to the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, or Administrative Agent has received a notice from a Lender or Borrower, referring to this Agreement, describing such Inchoate Default or Event of Default and indicating that such notice is a notice of default. If Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of an Inchoate Default or Event of Default, Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Inchoate Default or Event of Default as is provided in Article VI or if not provided for in Article VI, as Administrative Agent shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, however, unless and until Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Inchoate Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders. 7.5 INDEMNIFICATION. Without limiting the Obligations of Borrower hereunder, each Lender agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent, ratably in accordance with its Proportionate Share for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in refusing to take or to continue to take any action hereunder or under any other Credit Facility Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its Proportionate Share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, administration or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Credit Facility Documents, to the extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to 31
indemnification or reimbursement of its expenses under this Section 7.5 if it would not be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under Sections 5.12 and 8.4, respectively. 7.6 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Administrative Agent may resign hereunder at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and Borrower. Administrative Agent may be removed involuntarily only for a material breach of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Facility Documents, or for gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder or under the other Credit Facility Documents and then only upon the affirmative vote of the Majority Lenders (excluding Administrative Agent from such vote and Administrative Agent's Proportionate Share of the Total Commitment from the amounts used to determine the portion of the Total Commitment necessary to constitute the required Proportionate Shares of the remaining Lenders). Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint the successor Administrative Agent hereunder with the consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at such time hereunder. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders with the consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) appoint the successor Administrative Agent hereunder which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be a commercial bank having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent only under the Credit Facility Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Credit Facility Documents. 7.7 AUTHORIZATION. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized by the Lenders to execute, deliver and perform each of the Credit Facility Documents to which Administrative Agent is or is intended to be a party and each Lender agrees to be bound by all of the agreements of Administrative Agent contained in the Credit Facility Documents. Administrative Agent is further authorized by the Lenders to enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of curing any formal defect, inconsistency, omission or ambiguity in this Agreement or any Credit Facility Document to which it is a party. 7.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OTHER ROLES. With respect to its Commitments, the Loans made by it and any Notes issued to it, Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent. The term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, and 32
generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any other Person, without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 7.9 AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS. Subject to the provisions of this Section 7.9, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or another Credit Facility Document, the Majority Lenders (or Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Majority Lenders) and Borrower may enter into agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding, modifying or waiving any provisions to the Credit Facility Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or Borrower hereunder or waiving any Inchoate Default or Event of Default; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of all of the Lenders: (a) Modify Section 2.1.5, 2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1 7.1, 7.13, or 7.14; or (b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Majority Lenders or Required Lenders; or (c) Permit Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement; or (d) Amend this Section 7.9 or amend any defined term set forth herein, in any Credit Facility Document or in Exhibit A, to the extent such amendment would have the effect of violating the effect of the provisions of this Section 7.9; or (e) Release any collateral from a lien securing the Obligations of Borrower hereunder or release any funds from any account otherwise than in accordance with the terms hereof; or (f) Except as provided in Section 2.1.8, extend the maturity of any Loans (including any extension of the Original Maturity Date or the Maturity Date) or any Notes or reduce the principal amount thereof; or (g) Reduce the rate or change the time of payment of interest due on any Loan or any Note; or (h) Reduce the amount or change the time of payment of any fee or other amount due or payable; or (i) Increase the amount of the Commitment of any Lender. 7.10 WITHHOLDING TAX. 7.10.1 If the forms or other documentation required by Section 2.5.7 are not delivered to Administrative Agent, then Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to any Lender not providing such forms or other documentation, an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax. 33
7.10.2 If the Internal Revenue Service or any authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, together with all expenses incurred, including legal expenses, allocated staff costs, and any out of pocket expenses. Borrower shall not be responsible for any amounts paid or required to be paid by a Lender under this Section 7.10.2. 7.10.3 If any Lender sells, assigns, grants participations in, or otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement, the purchaser, assignee, transferee or participant shall comply with and be bound by the terms of Sections 2.5.7, 7.10.1 and 7.10.2 as though it were such Lender. 7.11 GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO PAYMENTS. Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender its pro rata share of each payment of principal and interest payable to the Lenders on the Loans and of fees hereunder received by Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders and of any other amounts owing under the Loans. The payments made for the account of each Lender shall be made, and distributed to it, for the account of (a) its domestic lending office in the case of payments of principal of, and interest on, its Base Rate Loans, (b) its domestic or foreign lending office, as each Lender may designate in writing to Administrative Agent, in the case of payments of principal of, and interest on, its LIBOR Loans and (c) its domestic lending office, or such other lending office as it may designate for the purpose from time to time, in the case of payments of fees and other amounts payable hereunder. Each Lender shall have the right to alter its designated domestic lending office upon notice to Administrative Agent and Borrower. 7.12 SUBSTITUTION OF LENDER. Should any Lender fail to make a Loan in violation of its obligations under this Agreement (a "Non-Advancing Lender"), Administrative Agent (a) may, in its sole discretion and without any obligation on its part to do so, fund the Loan on behalf of the Non-Advancing Lender and (b) shall cooperate with Borrower or any other Lender to find another Person that shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent and (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing) Borrower and that shall be willing to assume the Non-Advancing Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including the obligation to make the Loan which the Non-Advancing Lender failed to make but without assuming any liability for damages for failing to have made such Loan or any previously required Loan). Subject to the provisions of the next following sentence, such Person shall be substituted for the Non-Advancing Lender hereunder upon the payment by such Person of all interest and fees owed to the Non-Advancing Lender and execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an agreement acceptable to Administrative Agent and Borrower by such Person assuming the Non-Advancing Lender's obligations under this Agreement, and all interest and fees which would otherwise have been payable to the Non-Advancing Lender shall thereafter be payable to such Person. Nothing in (and no action taken pursuant to) this Section 7.12 shall relieve the Non-Advancing Lender 34
from any liability it might have to Borrower or to the other Lenders as a result of its failure to make any Loan. 7.13 PARTICIPATIONS. 7.13.1 Nothing herein provided shall prevent any Lender from selling a participation in its Commitments (and/or Loans made thereunder); provided that (a) no such sale of a participation shall alter such Lender's or Borrower's obligations hereunder and (b) any agreement pursuant to which any Lender may grant a participation in its rights with respect to its Commitments (and/or Loans) shall provide that, with respect to such Commitments (and/or Loans), subject to the following proviso, such Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to exercise the rights of such Lender, and enforce the obligations of Borrower relating to such Commitments (and/or Loans), including the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document and the right to take action to have the Notes declared due and payable pursuant to Article VI; provided, however, that such agreement may provide that the participant may have rights to approve or disapprove decreases in principal, interest rates or fees, lengthening of maturity of any Loans, postponements of any due dates for payments hereunder. No recipient of a participation in any Commitments or Loans of any Lender shall have any rights under this Agreement or shall be entitled to any reimbursement for taxes, other taxes, increased costs or reserve requirements under Section 2.7.3 or any other indemnity or payment rights against Borrower in excess of a proportionate amount which would have been payable to the Lender from whom such Person acquired its participation. 7.13.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (a "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to Administrative Agent and Borrower, the option to provide to Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (a) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, and (b) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any state thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.13, any SPC may (x) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, Borrower and Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by Borrower and Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the 35
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (y) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section may not be amended without the written consent of all SPCs having outstanding Loans or Commitments hereunder. 7.14 TRANSFER OF COMMITMENTS. 7.14.1 Assignments. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary (but subject to Section 7.13.2), any Lender, after receiving Administrative Agent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, the prior written consent of Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) may, from time to time, at its option, sell, assign, transfer, negotiate or otherwise dispose of a portion of its Commitment (and Loans made thereunder), in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by Administrative Agent, Arranger and Borrower), to any institution which in such assigning Lender's judgment is reasonably capable of performing the obligations of a Lender hereunder and reasonably experienced in corporate financing; provided, however, that in the case of an assignment by a Lender to another Lender or Affiliate of a Lender, the prior consent of Administrative Agent and Borrower shall not be required and the minimum assignment amount specified above shall not apply. In the event of any assignment made pursuant to this Section 7.14, (a) the assigning Lender's Proportionate Share shall be reduced by the amount of the Proportionate Share assigned to the new Lender, (b) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver an appropriate agreement (an "Assignment and Assumption") evidencing such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent and Borrower, (c) the parties to the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, excluding Borrower, shall collectively pay to Administrative Agent an administrative fee of $3,500 and (d) at the assigning Lender's option, Borrower shall execute and deliver to such new Lender a Note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, in a principal amount equal to its Proportionate Share but only if it shall also be executing or exchanging with the assigning Lender a replacement note in an amount equal to the Proportionate Share retained by the Lender, if any (provided that Borrower shall have received for cancellation the existing Note held by the assigning Lender). Thereafter, such new Lender shall be deemed to be a Lender and shall have all of the rights and duties of a Lender (except as otherwise provided in this Article VII), in accordance with its Proportionate Share, under each of the Credit Facility Documents. 7.14.2 Register. Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. 7.15 LAWS. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, no sale, assignment, transfer, negotiation or other disposition of the interests of any Lender hereunder 36
or under the other Credit Facility Documents shall be allowed if it would require registration under the federal Securities Act of 1933, as then amended, any other federal securities laws or regulations or the securities laws or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction. Borrower shall, from time to time at the request and expense of Administrative Agent, execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, or to such party or parties as Administrative Agent may designate, any and all further instruments as may in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent be necessary or advisable on the part of Borrower to give full force and effect to such disposition. 7.16 ASSIGNABILITY AS COLLATERAL. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Facility Document to the contrary, any Lender may assign all or any portion of the Loans or Note held by it as collateral security provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Loans or Note made by Borrower to or for the account of the assigning and/or pledging Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy Borrower's obligations hereunder in respect to such assigned Loans or Note to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. ARTICLE VIII MISCELLANEOUS 8.1 ADDRESSES.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE TECO ENERGY MEETS CASH GENERATION TARGET, OUTLINES STEPS TO FURTHER BOLSTER FINANCIAL POSITION Company announces new credit facility, dividend reduction, steps being taken to reduce merchant power risk, agreement to end Panda Energy relationship TAMPA, FL - APRIL 11, 2003 - Concurrent with its meeting with financial analysts today, TECO Energy is announcing the successful completion of the cash generation plan management unveiled in September 2002, and outlining a series of specific steps the company will take to further strengthen its financial position. The company also is announcing a new $350-million bank credit facility and a reduction in its common stock dividend. Chairman and CEO ROBERT FAGAN said, "We've accomplished what we set out to do in the cash plan we announced in September, but we're not stopping there. We are moving forward aggressively on the next steps. In doing so, we are working to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, and we're confident our actions will result in a stronger, healthier TECO Energy, which is good for all our investors over the long term." "This has been an enormously difficult time for the industry as a whole, but at TECO Energy, our good asset mix gives us a variety of options and means to deal with challenges and enhance our cash position," added Fagan. CASH GENERATION PLAN COMPLETE In September 2002, the company announced a $900-million plan, targeted for completion in early 2003 - a sufficient amount to complete its construction programs at Tampa Electric and TECO Power Services - with the goal of being fully internally funded in 2004. "Today, we're pleased to announce that we raised more than $950 million," said Fagan.
Exhibit 99.1 The last two items that have been put in place to implement the plan are the issuance of $250 million of long-term unsecured notes this morning to the investors who were previously to provide the debt in the sale of Tampa Electric's gasifier unit, and the receipt of more than $50 million from the sale of half of TECO Coal's synthetic fuel production facilities, the output of which qualifies for Section 29 tax credits for non-conventional fuels. Negotiations are also underway to sell an additional 40 percent of the company's synfuel production. DIVIDEND REDUCTION ANNOUNCED The company's plan in September was geared toward raising cash to complete its construction program and maintaining its dividend. However, because of continued difficult financial and power market conditions and rating agency concerns, all sources and uses of cash had to be reexamined, the company said. In light of these conditions, TECO Energy's Board of Directors has acted to reduce the dividend by 46 percent, to an annual rate of 76 cents, effective with the dividend payable in May. The Board of Directors has declared this quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share payable May 15 to shareholders of record as of May 1. At the current stock price, the annual dividend yield would be more than 7 percent. "This was not an easy decision for our Board of Directors to make, but this is a level that should, over time, maximize our total value to shareholders. This moves us closer to industry yields and continues to pay about $134 million in cash to our shareholders per year," said Fagan. CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED, ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY NOW AVAILABLE TECO Energy also announced that it has put in place a new $350-million unsecured credit facility with Merrill Lynch that will be available if required to refinance the bank term loan maturing in November of this year. The new facility is for up to 18 months. Moving ahead, the company will continue to strengthen its financial position through the sale of other separable and marketable assets, where there is good value that can be captured.
Exhibit 99.1 A REFOCUS ON UTILITY BUSINESS With the cash generation plan complete, TECO Energy is moving forward on a series of steps to refocus on the solid foundation of its core utility business. Tampa Electric, whose customer base continues to grow at more than 2 percent annually, will continue as the company's flagship. To meet this growth, Tampa Electric announced today that the first unit of the company's natural gas-fueled Bayside Power Station (repowered from coal-fired Gannon Power Station) is up and running, on time and on budget. Fagan underscored the refocus on utility operations and went on to outline further actions regarding TECO Energy's move away from merchant generation. The company indicated that it had always intended to have long-term contracts for the sale of power from its new facilities. However, given the condition of the power markets with low power prices, the lack of prospects for long-term contracts and the rollback of deregulation initiatives at the state and federal levels, the company is seeking to limit its merchant plant exposure. The company reiterated that it had ceased all new project development in 2002. "We are reviewing each of our merchant power facilities and will reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow, based on the outlook in each individual power market," said Fagan. Summarized below are the company's plans with regard to each of its major merchant facilities. TECO AND PANDA END JOINT VENTURE - TECO Power Services has reached an agreement with Panda Energy International to move up TPS' previously disclosed $60-million purchase obligation for Panda's interest in Union and Gila River to July 1, 2003 or sooner and expand that obligation to include Panda's interest in Texas Independent Energy (TIE) facilities (Guadalupe and Odessa) at a price of $58 million. The purchase will terminate Panda's ownership in these facilities in order to provide TPS with more control and flexibility to minimize its merchant plant exposure. TECO is moving forward to sell the TIE projects. The company reaffirmed its commitment to complete construction of the Union and Gila River facilities, as required by the projects' lenders. Panda Energy will continue to act as construction manager for the Union and Gila River projects, pursuant to a contract between Panda and the project companies. Following the termination of the TECO-Panda joint venture, the Union and Gila River projects will be consolidated on the company's financial
Exhibit 99.1 statements, which would otherwise have occurred in July under the new FIN 46 accounting rules. This will not impact the company's debt covenants, which specifically exclude non-recourse debt. DELL AND MCADAMS - TECO Power Services owns 100 percent of these plants in Arkansas and Mississippi. Construction was suspended last year with the facilities 90 percent complete. The company is aggressively pursuing opportunities with others to maximize the value of these facilities. ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS - TECO Power Services is exploring options to find other uses for turbines from two previously deferred projects. The due date for the next cash installment on those turbines is approaching. If the company is unsuccessful in finding other uses for them or delaying its next installment date, it could result in an accounting write-off. The consolidation of the former Panda interests is also expected to cause a significant valuation adjustment. While the exact accounting treatment of individual facilities and turbines has not been fully determined, the potential non-cash write-offs described by the company today approximate $300 to 350 million after taxes, most of which would likely be recorded during the second quarter.
