(c) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole which, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; (ii) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company, including the Offered Securities, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating) or the withdrawal by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization of its rating of any debt securities of the Company; (iii) any material suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. federal or New York authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States; (v) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, the effect of any event or change referred to in this clause (v) is so adverse and material as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities; or (vi) any change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions if, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, the effect of any event or change referred to in this clause (vi) is so adverse and material as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the public offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities.

In giving such opinion, such counsel may limit its opinion to the law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the federal law of the United States. Such counsel may also state that it has relied upon certificates of public officials and, insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, it has relied upon certificates of officers of the Company.

In addition to the matters set forth above, such opinion shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which causes it to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the Commission, or any amendment thereto, as of its effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of its issue date and as of the Closing Date, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its issue date and as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no comment as to the Forms T-1 or the financial statements, including the notes thereto and supporting schedules, or other financial information and data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. With respect to such statement, such counsel may state that its belief is based upon procedures set forth therein satisfactory to the Representatives but is without independent investigation or verification. (e) The Representatives shall have received an opinion addressed to the Underwriters, dated the Closing Date, of the general counsel of the Company, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and solely to the effect that: (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida, with corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Indenture; (ii) Each Significant Subsidiary has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus; except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and is owned of record and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, beneficially, by the Company, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, free and clear of any lien, encumbrance or defect; and none of the outstanding shares of -15-
capital stock of any Significant Subsidiary was issued in violation of the preemptive or, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, similar rights of any securityholder of such Significant Subsidiary; (iii) Each of the Offered Securities and the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; the Offered Securities, when validly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, will be validly issued; the Offered Securities and the Indenture, when validly authenticated, executed and delivered by the Trustee, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); (iv) All descriptions in the Registration Statement of written contracts and other documents to which the Company is a party are accurate in all material respects; to the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no franchises, contracts, indentures, mortgages, loan agreements, notes, leases or other instruments required to be described or referred to in the Registration Statement or to be filed as exhibits thereto other than those described or referred to therein or filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits thereto, and the descriptions thereof or references thereto are correct in all material respects; (v) No filing, registration or qualification with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order or decree of, any court or governmental agency or body (including without limitation the Florida Public Service Commission) is necessary or required in connection with the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Indenture or for the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the Offered Securities by the Company, except such as may be required under state securities law as to which such counsel need express no opinion; (vi) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, the Offered Securities and the Indenture and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in the Registration Statement (including the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities and the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Offered Securities as described in the Prospectus under the caption "Use of Proceeds") do not and will not, whether with or without the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, (i) violate, constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company pursuant to any agreement or instrument that is listed as an exhibit to the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 or any of the Company's Forms 10-Q or 8-K filed thereafter but on or prior to the date of such opinion, or (ii) violate (x) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, (y) any applicable statute, rule or regulation, or (z) any judgment, order, writ or decree -16-
known to such counsel of any government, government instrumentality or court; and (vii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. In giving such opinion, such counsel may limit her opinion to the law of the State of Florida, and such counsel may rely as to all matters governed by the laws of jurisdictions other than the law of the State of Florida, upon the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Representatives. Such counsel may assume the due authorization, execution and delivery of documents by the parties thereto, other than the Company. In addition to the matters set forth above, such opinion shall also include a statement to the effect that nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which causes her to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K was filed with the Commission, or any amendment thereto, as of its effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as its issue date and as of the Closing Date, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as of its issue date and as of the Closing Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood that such counsel need express no comment as to the Forms T-1 or the financial statements, including the notes thereto and supporting schedules, or other financial information and data contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. With respect to such statement, such counsel may state that her belief is based upon procedures set forth therein satisfactory to the Representatives but is without independent investigation or verification. (f) The Representatives shall have received from Ropes & Gray, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions addressed to the Underwriters, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the validity of the Offered Securities delivered on such Closing Date, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (g) The Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are contemplated by the Commission and, that subsequent to the date of -17-
the most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or other), business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate. (h) The Representatives shall have received a letter addressed to the Underwriters, dated the Closing Date, of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection. The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and documents as the Representatives reasonably request. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder. 7. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or arising out of any investigation or proceeding of any governmental agency or body, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; and, provided, further, that, this indemnity with respect to the Prospectus or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter (or any person controlling such Underwriter) from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Offered Securities that are the subject thereof if (i) such Underwriter did not send or deliver to such person a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented) (excluding delivery of documents incorporated therein by reference) at or prior to the confirmation of the sale of the Offered Securities to -18-
such person (but only to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to arise out of the untrue statement or omission of a material fact that was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented) that was not delivered by such Underwriter at or prior to confirmation of sale) in any case where such delivery is required by the Act, (ii) the Company has provided to such Underwriter sufficient quantities of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented) in sufficient time to enable such Underwriter to deliver to such person a copy of the Prospectus (or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented) in a timely manner, and (iii) the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Prospectus or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement was corrected in the Prospectus (or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented). In addition to and without limitation of the Company's obligation to indemnify Merrill Lynch as an Underwriter, the Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Independent Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as a result of the Independent Underwriter's participation as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with the offering of the Securities. Each Underwriter agrees that Merrill Lynch shall have no additional liability to any of the Underwriters pursuant to Sections 18 or 19 of the Merrill Lynch Master Agreement Among Underwriters (the "AAU") as a result of its serving as a "qualified independent underwriter" within the meaning of Rule 2720 of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. with respect to the offering and sale of the Offered Securities. In addition, each Underwriter agrees to pay its proportionate share, based upon the respective underwriting obligations of the Underwriters, of any liability of the type referred to in Sections 18 and 19 of the AAU incurred by Merrill Lynch in its capacity as Independent Underwriter. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in -19-
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following information in the Prospectus: (i) the selling concession and discount reallowance figures in the fifth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" and (ii) the information contained in the ninth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting." (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. If indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 6(a), then, in addition to the fees and expenses of such counsel for the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one counsel separate from its own counsel and that of any other indemnified party for the Independent Underwriter in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances if, in the reasonable judgment of the Independent Underwriter, there may exist a conflict of interest between the Independent Underwriter and any other indemnified party. Any such separate counsel for the Independent Underwriter and such control persons of the Independent Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Independent Underwriter. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in -20-
subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that Merrill Lynch will not receive any additional benefits hereunder for serving as the Independent Underwriter in connection with the offering and sale of the Offered Securities. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each partner, director or officer of the Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Underwriter under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director and officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act. 8. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of such Underwriter set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If -21-
for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect, and if any Offered Securities have been purchased hereunder the representations and warranties in Section 2 and all obligations under Section 5 shall also remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of a default under Section 9 hereof or the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of Section 6(c), the Company will reimburse the non-defaulting Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. 9. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase the Offered Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under this Agreement (the "DEFAULTED SECURITIES"), the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such principal amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then: (a) if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or (b) if the aggregate principal amount of the Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter. No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any Underwriter from liability in respect of its default. In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement either (i) the Representatives or (ii) the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section. 10. Notices.

No purchaser of the Offered Securities from an Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. 12. Counterparts.

We are rendering this supplemental opinion in connection with the prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") filed on or about June 10, 2003 by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. The Prospectus Supplement relates to the offering by the Company of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.50% Notes due 2010 (the "Notes"), which Notes are covered by the Registration Statement. The Notes will be issuable under an indenture dated as of August 17, 1998 (the "Base Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as heretofore amended and as supplemented by a ninth supplemental indenture between the Company and the Trustee (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). We understand that the Notes are to be offered and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus Supplement. We have acted as your counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement. We are familiar with the proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the authorization, issuance and sale of the Notes. We have examined such other documents as we consider necessary to render this opinion. We advise you that, in our opinion, the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when the Notes have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the Indenture relating to the Notes against payment of the agreed consideration therefor and issued and sold as contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether applied in proceedings in equity or at law. We have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible. The Indenture and Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York and, therefore, in rendering our opinion as to the validity and binding effect of the Notes, we have relied on the opinion of Ropes & Gray LLP with respect to matters of New York law. Except to the extent of such reliance, the opinion rendered herein is limited to the Florida Business Corporation Act
