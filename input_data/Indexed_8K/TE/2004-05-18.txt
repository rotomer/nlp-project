Synthetic Fuel Transaction
 
A subsidiary of TECO Coal has executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell a 40.5 percent ownership interest in its synthetic fuel facilities. The sale is scheduled to close June 1, 2004, subject to customary conditions. The sale will add to the previous 49.5 percent sale, which closed in 2003.
 
Chairman and CEO Robert Fagan said, "Upon closing, this sale will complete our announced plan to sell 90 percent of the ownership interest in our synfuel holdings and will further help us to achieve the cash flow objectives we outlined last month."
 
In addition to retaining a 10 percent ownership interest in the facilities, the TECO Coal subsidiary will continue to supply the feedstock and operate the facilities.
