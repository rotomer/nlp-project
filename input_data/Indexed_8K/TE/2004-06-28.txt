Other Events
 
TECO Energy today updated the status of efforts to finalize a definitive agreement for the transfer of the Union and Gila River power stations to the lending bank group. The letter of intent, announced February 5, 2004, included target dates of June 30 for a definitive agreement and September 30 for completion of the transaction.
 
Due diligence is essentially complete, and work continues on the terms of the definitive agreement. While completion of the definitive agreement is now expected to occur after June 30, the September 30 target date for the final transfer of the projects remains unchanged.
