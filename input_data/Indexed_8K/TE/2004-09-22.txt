Item 8.01: Other Events
 
On September 21, 2004, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) voted to reduce the amounts collected by Tampa Electric Company through the fuel adjustment clause for water transportation services for coal and petroleum coke provided by subsidiaries of TECO Transport Corporation. Tampa Electric and TECO Transport are subsidiaries of TECO Energy, Inc. Annually, the reduction is estimated to be in a range of $14 million to $16 million pre-tax, or $8 million to $10 million after-tax, continuing as long as the contract is in effect, depending on a variety of factors. This decision does not require Tampa Electric to rebid, nor does it prohibit Tampa Electric from rebidding, the water transportation and terminal services contract, which expires on December 31, 2008.
 
The FPSC is expected to issue a final order on this matter within the next several weeks. The final order will be followed by a 15-day appeal period during which parties to the proceeding can seek a rehearing and subsequently appeal the FPSC decision. Tampa Electric is currently evaluating its options relating to this decision.
