We have acted as counsel for Tampa Electric Company, a Florida corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the merger of Peoples Gas System, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Peoples Gas"), with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), and in connection with the Amended and Restated Note Agreement, dated as of May 30, 1997, between the Company and you (the "Restated Note Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given them in the Restated Note Agreement. This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set forth in paragraph (b) of Part Ill of the Restated Note Agreement and with the understanding that you are relying on the opinions expressed herein.
 
In this connection, we have examined the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes, the Assumption, the Merger Agreement and such certificates of public officials, certificates of officers of the Company and copies certified to our satisfaction of corporate documents and records of the Company and of other papers, and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for our opinion hereinafter set forth. We have relied upon such certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which were not independently established; nothing, however, has come to our attention that causes us to believe that any such factual matters are untrue.
 
Any opinion expressed herein as being "to our knowledge" is based upon our having made inquiry of the Company or our having actual knowledge as the result of our representation of the Company with respect to other matters, but not upon our having made an independent investigation. Our opinion in paragraph 3 is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption may be subject to or affected by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Furthermore, we express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions in the Restated Note Agreement providing for an increase in the interest rate upon default or the payment of a premium upon an unscheduled payment of principal to the extent that such increased rates or premium would violate applicable usury laws or be deemed to constitute a penalty.
 
We are members of the Bar of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and do not purport to be experts on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the corporate laws of the State of Florida and the Federal laws of the United States of America. To the extent the laws of the State of Florida (other than the corporate laws) are relevant to the opinions herein expressed, you have received the opinions of Sheila M. McDevitt, Esquire, and Ausley & McMullen P.A., addressed to you and dated as of even date herewith. As to any requirement of any approval of the Merger by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act, we have relied with your permission on the opinion of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom dated as of even date herewith, a copy of which has been delivered to you. Except to such extent, we do not herein express any opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the corporate laws of the State of Florida and the Federal laws of the United States of America.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and having regard for legal considerations that we deem relevant, it is our opinion that:
 
1. The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own its property, to carry on its business as now being conducted and to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Note Agreements, as amended and restated by the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption.
 
2. The Merger of Peoples Gas with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, has become effective in accordance with the Merger Agreement and applicable laws.
 
3. The Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action and duly executed and delivered by authorized officers of the Company, and the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption are valid obligations of the Company, legally binding upon and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, and the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Restated Note Agreement.
 
4. The execution and delivery of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption by the Company, and the performance by the Company of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption, do not conflict with, or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company pursuant to, the charter or by-laws of the Company, any applicable law (including any securities or Blue Sky law), statute, rule or regulation or, to our knowledge, any agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which the Company is a party or otherwise subject or by which any of the Company's property, rights, interests or assets are bound.
 
5. No consent, license, approval, order or authorization of, or registration or declaration with, any governmental authority, bureau or agency or any court or other Person is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes or the Assumption, or the performance by the Company of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes or the Assumption, or the consummation of the Merger, except each of which has been
 
duly obtained and is in full force and effect and is final, and for which all periods of appeal relating thereto have expired, and which is not the subject of any pending or threatened attack by way of direct proceedings or otherwise.
 
We acknowledge that the Company has requested that this opinion be rendered to you and for the benefit of any Transferee, that this opinion is rendered with the intention that you and any Transferee may rely thereon and that you and any Transferee may so rely thereon.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
As Vice President and Assistant General Counsel of TECO Energy, Inc., I have acted as counsel for Tampa Electric Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida (the "Company"), in connection with the merger of Peoples Gas System, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Peoples Gas"), with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), and in connection with the Amended and Restated Note Agreement, dated as of May 30, 1997, between the Company and you (the "Restated Note Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given them in the Amended and Restated Note Agreement. This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set forth in paragraph (b) of Part III of the Restated Note Agreement and with the understanding that you are relying on the opinions expressed herein.
 
In this connection, I have examined the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes, the Assumption, the Merger Agreement and such certificates of public officials, certificates of officers of the Company and copies certified to my satisfaction of corporate documents and records of the Company and of other papers, and have made such other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for my opinion hereinafter set forth. I have relied upon such certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which were not independently established; nothing, however, has come to my attention that causes us to believe that any such factual matters are untrue.
 
My opinion in paragraph 1 is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption may be subject to or affected by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Furthermore, I express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions in the Restated Note Agreement providing for an increase in the interest rate upon default or the payment of a premium upon an unscheduled payment of principal to the extent that such increased rates or premium would violate applicable usury laws or be deemed to constitute a penalty.
 
To the extent that the opinions expressed below involve the validity of the Restated Note Agreement, the execution and delivery of the documents related thereto, or governmental approvals necessary for the issuance of the Notes, or the effectiveness of the Merger, I have relied with your permission upon the opinions of even date of Ausley & McMullen P.A. and Palmer & Dodge LLP, copies of which have been delivered to you.
 
I am a member of The Florida Bar, and, as such, do not purport to be an expert on the laws of any jurisdiction other than Florida, and do not express any opinion concerning matters governed by any laws other than the laws of Florida. I do not express any opinion concerning matters governed by any federal securities laws.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and having regard for legal considerations that I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. The Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption are valid obligations of the Company, legally binding upon and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms, and the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Restated Note Agreement.
 
2. No consent, license, approval, order or authorization of, or registration or declaration with, any governmental authority, bureau or agency or any court or other Person is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes or the Assumption, or the performance by the Company of the Restated Note Agreement, the Notes or the Assumption, or the consummation of the Merger, except each of which has been duly obtained and is in full force and effect and is final, and for which all periods of appeal relating thereto have expired, and which is not the subject of any pending or threatened attack by way of direct proceedings or otherwise.
 
3. A court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Florida (or a court of the United States of America sitting in Florida and applying Florida law) will honor the choice of New York law to govern the Restated Note Agreement and Notes and will not apply the substantive laws of the State of Florida.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Tampa Electric Company (the "Company") in connection with matters pertaining to the laws, rules, and regulations administered by the Florida Public Service Commission (the "Commission") and in connection with the Company's application for authority to issue and sell up to $300,000,000 of long-term debt and common and preferred equity securities and to have outstanding a maximum of $300,000,000 in short-term unsecured promissory notes during the twelve months ending November 30, 1997. The Commission approved the application arid rendered Order No. PSC-96-1237-FOF-EI in Docket No. 960899-El (the "Order") on October 7, 1996. We have also acted as counsel to the Company in connection with the merger of Peoples Gas System, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Peoples Gas"), with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"), and in connection with the Amended and Restated Note Agreement, dated as of May 30, 1997, between the Company and you (the "Amended and Restated Note Agreement"). Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given them in the Amended and Restated Note Agreement. This letter is being delivered to you in satisfaction of the condition set forth in paragraph (b) of Part Ill of the Amended and Restated Note Agreement and with the understanding that you are relying on the opinions expressed herein.
 
In this connection, we have examined the Amended and Restated Note Agreement, the Notes, the Assumption, the Merger Agreement, and such certificates of public officials, certificates of officers of the Company and copies certified to our satisfaction of corporate documents and records of the Company and of other papers, including the Order and confirmation from the Company that the only long-term debt or common or preferred equity securities issued by the Company on or after December 1, 1997 consisted of $75,000,000 principal amount of long term debt securities, and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for our opinion hereinafter set forth. We have relied upon such certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company with respect to the accuracy of material factual matters contained therein which were not independently established; nothing, however, has come to our attention that causes us to believe that any such factual matters are untrue.
 
Based upon such investigations, and having due regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that the Order is final and the appeal period therefor has expired, that the Order is in full force and effect on the date hereof and has not been revoked or repealed,
 
that the terms of the Notes, including the maturity thereof, are consistent with the provisions of the Order, that all necessary authorizations under the laws, rules, and regulations administered by the Commission have been obtained in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance by the Company of the Amended and Restated Note Agreement, the Notes and the Assumption, and that no approval or order from the Commission is required in connection with the Merger.
