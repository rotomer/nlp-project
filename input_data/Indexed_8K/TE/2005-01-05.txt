Item 9.01: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
As reported on a Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 22, 2004 and filed on December 29, 2004, TECO Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries completed the sale of Frontera Generation Limited Partnership (Frontera), the owner of the Frontera Power Station in Texas, to a subsidiary of Centrica plc. TECO Energy, Inc. has determined that the operating results and charges related to Frontera will be reported as discontinued operations on its consolidated income statements and has filed this Amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K to provide the pro forma financial information required as a result of that determination.
 
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet reflects the disposition of Frontera as if it had occurred on Sept. 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, no longer reflect the results of Frontera operations and charges as continuing operations since those results will be included in discontinued operations. The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent TECO Energy, Inc.'s future consolidated financial position or future consolidated results of operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
