Item 8.01: Other Events
 
On July 29, 2005, TECO Synfuel Holdings, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of TECO Energy, Inc., sold an eight percent (8%) membership interest in Pike Letcher Synfuel, LLC (Pike Letcher Synfuel). Pike Letcher Synfuel is engaged in the production and sale of synthetic fuel from bituminous coal and a reagent.
 
This is the third transaction involving a sale of membership interests in Pike Letcher Synfuel. A 49.5% membership interest was sold in April 2003 and an additional 40.5% membership interest was sold in May 2004. TECO Energy, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is retaining a two percent (2%) interest in Pike Letcher Synfuel.
 
Proceeds from this sale could reach $43.5 million, most of which would be paid in monthly installments over the period July 2005 to December 2007. Because the purchase price is related to the value of tax credits generated over the next two and one-half years, it is subject to a reduction to the extent the credit is limited due to the average domestic oil price for a particular year exceeding the benchmark designated for that year by the Department of Energy.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
