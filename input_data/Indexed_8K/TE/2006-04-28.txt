Item 1.01: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On April 26, 2006, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of TECO Energy, Inc. (the "Corporation") approved the performance goals for the 2006 annual incentive awards under the Corporation's Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The 2006 target incentive award percentages for the executives participating in the plan were set in January 2006 and reported in Exhibit 10.10.1 to the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 7, 2006 (the "Annual Report"). The 2006 performance goals approved by the Committee and the relative weighting of such goals are set forth below:
 
 
 
As discussed in the Annual Report, the Corporation's base earnings and cash flow forecasts exclude the impact of any reduction in the benefits from synthetic fuel production which are subject to significant variability due to the potential impact of high oil prices. Similarly, the financial performance goals approved for the executive officers assume no reduction in the benefits from the synthetic fuel tax credits. In order that payouts under the 2006 Plan reflect the impact of oil prices on financial results, payouts under the Plan will be calculated by first determining each executive officer's aggregate goal achievement as if there had been no synfuel-related impact on results, and then reducing that aggregate goal achievement by the same percentage that the Corporation's earnings per share are impacted by any reduction in proceeds from the sale of synthetic fuel ownership interests due to high oil prices reducing the value of the synthetic fuel tax credits.
Also, as reported in the Corporation's 2006 proxy statement, the 15% portion of each executive officer's annual incentive award that is based on the Corporation's annual earnings per share growth and return on equity relative to that of other companies in the industry is determined in April. The market data showed that the Corporation was in the top quartile of its peer group companies for earnings per share growth and return on equity, which resulted in the approval on April 26, 2006, of the maximum payout of 150% for these goals, in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
