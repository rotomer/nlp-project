Item 8.01: Other Events
During a scheduled mediation on February 16, 2007, the company reached an agreement in principle to settle the shareholder securities class action lawsuit ("class action suit") and, at the same time, the company's officers and directors reached a similar agreement to settle the shareholder derivative lawsuit ("derivative suit") pending in the Federal District Court in Tampa, Florida and the Florida State Circuit Court for the 13
th
Circuit in Tampa, respectively, both relating to merchant power activities during 2001 and 2002. The settlement in the class action suit will resolve all claims against the company and the two individual defendants, including the one remaining category of claims that was not dismissed by the federal court's order issued on October 10, 2006 in response to the company's motion to dismiss. The settlement in the derivative suit will also resolve all claims against the directors and officers. Under the terms of the settlements, the company's primary insurance carrier will pay the settlement amount of $17.35 million to completely resolve the class action suit. In the derivative suit, the company will institute certain corporate governance changes along with those previously instituted since the pendency of the suit and the company's insurance carrier will pay the plaintiff's attorney's fees in the amount of $400,000. All defendants in both cases will receive releases of all claims, and both lawsuits will be dismissed with prejudice. The settlement is subject to various conditions, including the execution of definitive agreements and releases, approval by the applicable federal or state court and the appropriate shareholder notices.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
