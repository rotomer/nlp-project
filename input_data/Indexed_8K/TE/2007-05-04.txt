Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
As reported in the Corporation's 2007 proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement"), the 10% to 15% portion of each executive officer's 2006 annual incentive award that is based on the Corporation's annual earnings per share growth and return on equity relative to that of other companies in the industry was determined after the printing of the Proxy Statement. The determination occurred on May 2, 2007 and resulted in a payout of 87.34% of target. This payout included a reduction to the payout percentage of 18.45%, which as described in the Proxy Statement, corresponds to the percentage that the Corporation's earnings per share in 2006 were impacted by the reduction in proceeds from the sale of synthetic fuel ownership interests due to a reduction in the value of the synthetic fuel tax credits caused by high oil prices.
Below is the Summary Compensation Table included in the Proxy Statement amended and restated to reflect the payment of the portion of the annual incentive described above, which changed the values shown under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" and "Total" columns.
