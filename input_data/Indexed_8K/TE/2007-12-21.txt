Issuance of the TECO Finance Notes
On December 21, 2007, TECO Finance, as issuer, TECO Energy, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, entered into an indenture, a first supplemental indenture and a second supplemental indenture, governing the newly issued TECO Finance notes. The indenture provides for the issuance from time to time of various series of debt securities, including the TECO Finance notes. The TECO Finance 6.572% notes due 2017, the TECO Finance 7.20% notes due 2011 and the TECO Finance 7.00% notes due 2012 were issued pursuant to the first supplemental indenture. The TECO Finance 6.75% notes due 2015 were issued pursuant to the second supplemental indenture. The TECO Finance notes issued in the par-for-par exchange offers have the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity and covenants as the corresponding TECO Energy notes. Interest on each series of TECO Finance notes accrues from the settlement date of the exchange offers.
Pursuant to the indenture, as supplemented,
 
 
 
 
TECO Energy may redeem some or all of each series of the TECO Finance notes at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the applicable TECO Finance notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or (ii) the net present value of the remaining payments of principal and interest on the applicable TECO Finance notes, discounted at the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture), plus 50 basis points for the TECO Finance 6.572% notes due 2017 and the TECO Finance 6.75% notes due 2015 and 25 basis points for the TECO Finance 7.20% notes due 2011 and the TECO Finance 7.00% notes due 2012. In each case, the redemption price would include accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
Under the indenture, as supplemented, with respect to each series of TECO Finance notes, each of the following is an event of default: (i) failure to pay any interest on (or additional payments pursuant to the registration rights agreement as discussed below) any TECO Finance notes of that series when due, and such failure has continued for 30 days; (ii) failure to pay principal of or any premium on any TECO Finance notes of that series when due; (iii) failure to deposit any sinking fund payment in respect of any TECO Finance notes of that series when due, and such failure has continued for 30 days; (iv) failure to perform any other covenant in the indenture (other than a covenant included in the indenture solely for the benefit of a series of TECO Finance notes other than that series), and such failure has continued for 90 days after TECO Finance, TECO Energy and the trustee receive written notice as provided in the indenture; (v) the guarantee of TECO Energy ceases to be in effect or the guarantor denies its obligations under the guarantee; (vi) events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; and (vii) any other event defined as an event of default with respect to TECO Finance notes of a particular series.
If an event of default with respect to any series of TECO Finance notes occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding TECO Finance notes of that series may declare the principal amount of all TECO Finance notes of that series to be immediately due and payable. Under some circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding TECO Finance notes of that series may rescind and annul that declaration and its consequences.
Pursuant to a negative pledge contained in the second supplement indenture governing the TECO Finance 6.75% notes due 2015, if TECO Energy incurs, issues, assumes or guarantees any debt that is secured by a mortgage, pledge or other lien on (i) certain property having a net book value in excess of 2% of consolidated net assets (as defined in the supplemental indenture), (ii) capital stock or (iii) any subsidiary debt, TECO Energy will, subject to certain exceptions set forth therein, secure the TECO Finance 6.75% notes due 2015 equally and ratably with such debt.
The TECO Finance notes are unsecured and rank equally with TECO Finance's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TECO Energy. The guarantees of TECO Energy are unsecured and rank equally with all of TECO Energy's other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
The foregoing description of the indenture, the supplemental indentures and the TECO Finance notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual indenture, the first supplemental indenture and the second supplemental indenture (which include the applicable forms of notes), copies of which are filed herewith at Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
The TECO Finance notes are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws and were issued pursuant to exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the TECO Finance notes, TECO Finance entered into a registration rights agreement, dated December 21, 2007, with the lead dealer managers and the co-dealer managers, pursuant to which TECO Finance is obligated to file within 90 days after the date of the original issuance of the TECO Finance notes a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange each series of TECO Finance notes for a series of identical registered exchange notes registered under the Securities Act. In addition, TECO Finance is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 240 days after the original issuance of the TECO Finance notes. Under certain circumstances, TECO Finance may be required to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the TECO Finance notes. If TECO Finance fails to satisfy these and other obligations contained in the registration rights agreement, it will be obligated to make additional payments to the holders of the TECO Finance notes in an amount starting at 0.25% per year, and potentially increasing to up to 1.0% per year, until such failed obligations are cured.
The foregoing description of the registration rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual registration rights agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

ANNEX A
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities. The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."

ANNEX C
Each broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.

Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities. Any broker-dealer that resells Exchange Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such Exchange Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of Exchange Securities and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities Act.

For a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date the Company will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal.
