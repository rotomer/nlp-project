Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
As contemplated in the Corporation's 2008 proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement"), the 10% or 15% portion of each executive officer's 2007 annual incentive award that is based on the Corporation's annual earnings per share growth and return on equity relative to that of other companies in the industry was determined on April 30, 2008, after the printing of the Proxy Statement. The Corporation was in the top quartile of the peer group companies for return on equity and in the top quartile of the peer group companies for earnings per share growth, which resulted in the approval pursuant to the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan of a payout of 150% for this goal.
Below is the Summary Compensation Table included in the Proxy Statement, which has been amended and restated to reflect the payment of the portion of the annual incentive described above, which changed the values shown under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" and "Total" columns for 2008. The former executive officers included in the Summary Compensation Table in the Proxy Statement are not included in this table, as there were no changes to the information regarding those persons presented in the Summary Compensation Table in the Proxy Statement.
