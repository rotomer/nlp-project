Section 8  Other Events
 
On July 14, 2009, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) approved Tampa Electric's motion for reconsideration filed with the FPSC on May 15, 2009. As previously reported, Tampa Electric's basis for its motion for reconsideration was to address a technical issue related to the reconciliation of the rate base to the capital structure in calculating the weighted average cost of capital. The approval of this motion results in an overall weighted cost of capital of 8.29 percent, compared to the 8.11 percent previously approved, and will result in an additional total increase in base revenues of approximately $9.8 million annually with $9.3 million of that amount for 2009 on a full year basis. Rates will reflect this increase effective August 13, 2009.
In the same meeting, the FPSC denied the motion for reconsideration related to the 2010 second step base rate increase filed by intervenors in this case, which included the Citizens of the State of Florida represented by the Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Retail Federation, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, AARP and the Attorney General Office of the State of Florida, as a group.
