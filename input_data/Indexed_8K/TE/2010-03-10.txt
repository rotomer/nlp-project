required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Basic Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission; that (subject to Section 7(d) below) any such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if the defendants (including impleaded parties) in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded after consultation with counsel that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties.

Actions against Parties, Notification
provided
however
(d) . If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 7(a)(ii) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
Settlement without Consent if Failure to Reimburse
If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
SECTION 8. .
Contribution
 
the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover.
The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by an Underwriter in writing through the Representatives and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
For purposes of this Section 8, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same
 
rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or the Guarantor, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in hereto and not joint.
Schedule A
SECTION 9. .
Survival
The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantor or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Notes to the Underwriters and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or controlling persons.
SECTION 10. .
Termination of Agreement
(a) . The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company and the Guarantor, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Prospectus, any material adverse change (or event involving a prospective change) in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, or business affairs of the Guarantor, the Company and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to offer, sell and deliver the Notes, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or if trading generally on the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange or in the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited (other than to provide for an orderly market), or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any other governmental authority, or (iv) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.
Termination; General

No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Agreement either (i) the Representatives or (ii) the Company or the Guarantor shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

Exhibit 5.3
TECO Finance, Inc.
702 North Franklin Street
Tampa, Florida 33602
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Reference is made to our opinion dated March 6, 2009 and included as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-157759) (the "Registration Statement") filed on March 6, 2009 by TECO Finance, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), TECO Energy, Inc., a Florida corporation and parent of the Company (the "Guarantor"), and Tampa Electric Company, a Florida corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Guarantor, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). We are rendering this supplemental opinion in connection with the prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") filed on or about March 4, 2010 by the Company and the Guarantor with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act. The Prospectus Supplement relates to the offering by the Company, and the guarantee by the Guarantor (the "Guarantee"), of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% Notes due 2016 and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.15% Notes due 2020 (collectively, the "Notes"), which Notes are covered by the Registration Statement. The Notes will be issuable under an indenture dated as of December 21, 2007 (the "Base Indenture") among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (f/k/a The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as heretofore amended, and as supplemented by a third supplemental indenture to be entered into among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee (together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"). We understand that the Notes are to be offered and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus Supplement.
We have acted as your counsel in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement. We are familiar with the proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Company and the proceedings of the Board of Directors of the Guarantor in connection with the authorization, issuance and sale of the Notes and the authorization and issuance of the Guarantee. We have examined such other documents as we consider necessary to render this opinion. We advise you that, in our opinion, the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and when the Notes have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the Indenture relating to the Notes against payment of the agreed consideration therefor and issued and sold as contemplated in the Prospectus Supplement, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantee will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, all subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general

application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and (ii) general principles of equity, regardless of whether applied in proceedings in equity or at law. We have relied as to certain matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and the Guarantor and other sources believed by us to be responsible.
The opinion rendered herein is limited to New York law, the Florida Business Corporation Act (including the reported judicial decisions interpreting that Act and applicable provisions, if any, of the Florida Constitution) and the federal laws of the United States.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as part of the Registration Statement and to the reference to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement.
