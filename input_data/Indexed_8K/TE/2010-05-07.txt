Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
 
As contemplated in the Corporation's 2010 proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement"), the 5% or 20% portion of each executive officer's 2009 annual incentive award that is based on the Corporation's annual earnings per share growth and return on equity relative to that of other companies in the industry was determined on May 5, 2010. As described on page 16 of the Proxy Statement, the achievement level of this portion of the annual incentive award is dependent on the Corporation's ranking within the list of peer companies described in the Proxy Statement for these metrics, with earnings per share growth given twice the weight of return on equity. If the Corporation's performance is below the median, there is no payout for that element of the goal. If the Corporation's performance ranks in the top quarter of those companies for both elements, the goal is paid out at 150%, and if the Corporation is above the median but below the top quarter, pay out is prorated linearly between 0% and 150%, based on where the Corporation ranks on the list for each element. The Corporation was in the second quartile of the peer group companies for return on equity and in the top quartile of the peer group companies for earnings per share growth, which resulted in the approval pursuant to the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan of a payout of 119.2% for this goal.
Below is the Summary Compensation Table included in the Proxy Statement, which has been amended and restated to reflect the payment of the portion of the annual incentive described above, which changed the values shown under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" and "Total" columns for 2009. The former executive officers included in the Summary Compensation Table in the Proxy Statement are not included in this table as there were no changes to the information regarding those persons presented in the Summary Compensation Table in the Proxy Statement.
