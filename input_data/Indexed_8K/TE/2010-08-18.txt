Section 8  Other Events
 
On August 17, 2010, the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) voted to approve the stipulation entered into on July 20, 2010 by Tampa Electric Company and the intervenors in FPSC Docket No. 090368-EI "Review of the continuing need and cost associated with Tampa Electric Company's 5 Combustion Turbines and Big Bend Rail Facility" and Tampa Electric's 2008 base rate proceeding. As previously reported, this stipulation resolves all issues in the above docket and all issues in the intervenors appeal of the FPSC's 2009 decision in Tampa Electric's base rate proceeding pending before the Florida Supreme Court. Therefore, the FPSC's approval of the stipulation enables the docket related to the base rate proceeding to be closed, subject to a final order by the FPSC, which is expected in September, and the expiration of a 30-day appeal period. The terms of the stipulation remain as previously reported.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
