Item 8.01  Other Events
As previously reported, on January 13, 2009, a TECO Energy subsidiary, TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC, (TGH), delivered a Notice of Intent to the Guatemalan government that it intended to file an arbitration claim against the Republic of Guatemala under the Dominican Republic Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) alleging a violation of fair and equitable treatment of its investment in Empresa Elctrica de Guatemala (EEGSA). On October 20, 2010, TGH filed a Notice of Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to proceed with its arbitration claim.
The arbitration was prompted by actions of the Guatemalan government in July 2008 which, among other things, unilaterally reset the distribution tariff for EEGSA at levels well below the then existing tariffs. These actions caused a significant reduction in earnings from EEGSA. Until October 21, 2010, TGH held a 24% ownership interest in EEGSA through a holding company (DECA II) with Iberdrola Energia, S.A. and Electricidade de Portugal, S.A. On such date, TGH's interest was sold as described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 21, 2010. In connection with the sale of TGH's ownership interest in EEGSA, TGH reserved the right to pursue the arbitration claim described above.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
