Item 5.03  Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
On May 2, 2012, at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholders of TECO Energy, Inc. (the "Corporation") approved the amendment and restatement of the Articles of Incorporation to declassify the Board of Directors, as more fully described in the proxy statement relating to such meeting. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Department of State of the State of Florida on May 3, 2012 and were effective as of such date. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, directors who were elected prior to the approval of such amendment and restatement (including directors elected at the 2012 Annual Meeting) will complete those terms for which they were elected. Thereafter, their successors will be elected to one-year terms. Beginning with the 2015 Annual Meeting, all directors will stand for election annually. The amendment also includes minor changes to clarify how vacancies on the Board are to be filled and to clarify that a director being removed from the Board does not vote on such removal. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation integrate the amendments described above and all prior amendments to the Articles of Incorporation, but do not further amend the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, other than to eliminate the references to provisions only applicable to the initial Articles of Incorporation, namely the commencement of existence, the initial board of directors and the incorporator. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Amendment to the Bylaws
The Corporation's Board of Directors previously approved amendments to Section 3.2 and 3.6 of the Bylaws, which amendments became effective upon the filing of Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Department of State of the State of Florida on May 3, 2012. Section 3.2 of the Bylaws was amended to eliminate the Board of Director's classified structure in the same manner as the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, and Section 3.6 of the Bylaws was amended to clarify how vacancies on the Board are to be filled, in the same manner as the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Bylaws, as amended, which are filed as Exhibit 3.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

(4) after such Interested Shareholder has become an Interested Shareholder and prior to the consummation of such Business Combination:
(a) except as approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, there shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular dates therefor the full amount of any dividends (whether or not cumulative) payable on any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation;

(F) "Subsidiary" means any corporation of which a majority of any class of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation or by a Subsidiary or by the corporation and one or more Subsidiaries; provided, however, that for the purposes of the definition of Interested Shareholder set forth in Section 3, paragraph (B) of this Article VI, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean only a corporation of which a majority of each class of equity security is owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation.
(G) "Disinterested Director" means any member of the Board of Directors of the corporation who is unaffiliated with, and not a nominee of, the Interested Shareholder and was a member of the Board prior to the time that the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, and any successor of a Disinterested Director who is unaffiliated with, and not a nominee of, the Interested Shareholder and who is recommended to succeed a Disinterested Director by a majority of Disinterested Directors then on the Board of Directors.

(I) In the event of any Business Combination in which the corporation survives, the phrase "other consideration to be received" as used in Section 2, paragraphs (B)(1) and (2) of this Article VI shall include the shares of Common Stock and/or the shares of any other class of outstanding Voting Stock retained by the holders of such shares.
Section 4. A majority of the Disinterested Directors of the corporation shall have the power and duty to determine, on the basis of information known to them after reasonable inquiry, all facts necessary to determine compliance with this Article VI, including, without limitation:

The good faith determination of a majority of the Disinterested Directors on such matters shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this Article VI.
Section 5. Nothing contained in this Article VI shall be construed to relieve any Interested Shareholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.
Section 1. Except as may be otherwise fixed by or pursuant to the provisions of these Articles of Incorporation, as amended from time to time, relating to the rights of the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, (i) the number of the directors of the corporation shall be fixed from time to time by or pursuant to the bylaws of the corporation and (ii) any vacancy on the board of directors resulting from an increase in the number of directors or from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause shall be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office until the next annual election of directors by the shareholders and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Directors who are elected at an annual meeting of shareholders shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders following their election. All directors, including any director in office at the time of the adoption of this revised Article VII, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected, and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
Section 2. Advance notice of shareholder nominations for the election of directors shall be given in the manner provided in the bylaws of the corporation.
Section 3. Subject to the rights of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect directors under specified circumstances, any director may be removed from office, with or without cause, only by the majority vote of the Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 percent of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
 
Any action required or permitted to be taken by the shareholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Special meetings of the shareholders of the corporation shall be held whenever called by the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Board of Directors, or the holder or holders of not less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereat, or at the request of such holder or holders by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.
Section 1. The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on shareholders herein are granted subject to this reservation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article IX and the provisions of Articles VI, VII and VIII, may not be altered, amended or repealed in any respect, nor may any provision inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock of all classes and series of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; provided, however, that such 80 percent vote shall not be required for any alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption unanimously recommended by the board of directors if all such directors are Disinterested Directors as defined in Section 3, paragraph (G) of Article VI.
Section 2. The power to adopt, alter, amend or repeal bylaws shall be vested in the board of directors, provided that any such adoption, alteration, amendment or repeal of the bylaws shall not be inconsistent with these Articles of Incorporation. The bylaws of the corporation may be altered, amended or repealed, and new bylaws may be adopted, by shareholders only if such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock of all classes and series of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

To be timely, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than one hundred-twenty (120) days nor more than one hundred-fifty (150) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within twenty-five (25) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
To be in proper written form, a shareholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and record address of such shareholder, (iii) (A) the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned by such shareholder, (B) the name of each nominee holder of shares owned beneficially but not of record by such shareholder and the number of shares of stock held by each such nominee holder, (C) whether and the extent to which any derivative instrument, swap, option, warrant, short interest, hedge or profit interest has been
 
entered into by or on behalf of such shareholder or any of its affiliates or associates with respect to stock of the Corporation and (D) whether and the extent to which any other transaction, agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made by or on behalf of such shareholder or any of its affiliates or associates, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage risk or benefit of stock price changes for, such shareholder or any of its affiliates or associates or to increase or decrease the voting power or pecuniary or economic interest of such shareholder or any of its affiliates or associates with respect to stock of the Corporation, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (v) a representation that such shareholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and that such shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.11 to the contrary, a shareholder intending to nominate one or more persons for election as a Director at an annual or special meeting must comply with Section 3.7 of these bylaws for such nominations to be properly brought before such meeting.
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.11, provided, however, that, once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.11 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any shareholder of any such business. If the Chairman of an annual meeting determines that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

The Directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation to elect Directors under specified circumstances, shall be elected for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders following their election. All directors, including any director in office at the time of the adoption of this revised Section 3.2, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected, and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.

Number, Election and Terms
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) below with respect to Contested Elections, each nominee shall be elected a director by a Majority Vote with respect to that nominee's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of these Bylaws, a "Majority Vote" means that the number of votes cast in favor of a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast against that nominee's election.
