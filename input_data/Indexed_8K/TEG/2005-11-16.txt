Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On November 9, 2005, WPS Resources Corporation entered into two unsecured revolving credit agreements with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC as Co-Lead Arrangers and Book Managers, Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent. The $557.5 million credit agreement is to provide bridge financing (including to provide liquidity support for commercial paper) for the acquisition of the Minnesota and Michigan natural gas distribution operations of Aquila, Inc. The $300.0 million credit agreement is to provide bridge financing (including to provide liquidity support for commercial paper) for purchase price adjustments related to these acquisitions.
Commitments under the $557.5 million agreement will be reduced or eliminated when permanent long-term financing is completed for the Aquila acquisitions (exclusive of proceeds from our November 15, 2005 equity offering).
Under the $300.0 million credit agreement, loans cannot exceed the purchase price adjustments in connection with the Aquila acquisitions and no more than $200.0 million can be borrowed at the time of the first acquisition. Each of these loan commitments will be reduced by one-third 90 days after the consummation of the applicable acquisition with the remaining two-thirds due 180 days after the consummation of the applicable acquisition (or earlier if long-term financing or replacement credit agreements are executed).
Both of these credit agreements mature on September 5, 2007.
WPS Resources has the option to borrow funds under these credit agreements at fixed interest rates based on its public debt ratings, which currently are LIBOR plus 19.5 basis points or a floating rate equal to the greater of (a) the Federal Funds Rate in effect plus 1/2 of 1% or (b) the Prime Rate.
 
WPS Resources will pay lenders:
An annual administrative fee will also be paid to the Administrative Agent.
The new credit agreements contain customary events of default and customary restrictive and financial covenants, including a financial covenant regarding a maximum debt to capital ratio of 65%. The new credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing.
The lenders may terminate their obligation to extend credit under the credit agreements, and may accelerate payment of WPS Resources' indebtedness under these agreements, upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes WPS Resources' failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit agreements.
WPS Resources may from time to time enter into arms length transactions and maintain customary banking and investment banking relationships with the lenders under these credit agreements.
The credit agreements are filed as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated into this Current Report on Form 8-K by reference. The brief summary of the material provisions of the credit agreements set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the credit agreements filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(b)
  
It is the intent of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrower are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law.

If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.
 
3.8
  
Sharing of Payments

18
 
Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its pro rata share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, bankers lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

Each determination and calculation made by a Lender under this Section 4.1 shall, absent manifest error, be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

This Section shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Compensation

other official, excluding taxes measured by or imposed upon the net income of any Lender or its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, and all franchise taxes, branch taxes, taxes on doing business or taxes on the capital or net worth of any Lender or its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, in each case imposed in lieu of net income taxes: (i) by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or affiliate is organized or is located, or in which its principal executive office is located, or any nation within which such jurisdiction is located or any political subdivision thereof or (ii) by reason of any connection between the jurisdiction imposing such tax and such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or affiliate other than a connection arising solely from such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations, or received payment under or enforced, this Credit Agreement or any Notes.

(b)
  
Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall:
 
(A)

Notwithstanding the above, if any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Agent, then such Lender shall be exempt from such requirements. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to Section 11.3 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this subsection (b);
provided
that in the case of a participant of a Lender, the obligations of such participant of a Lender pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

In the event a Lender makes a request to the Borrower for additional payments in accordance with Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.4, then, provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, the Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense to include any transfer fee payable to the Agent under Section
 
24
 
11.3(b) and any expense pursuant to Section 4) and in its sole discretion, require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.3(b)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (a) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority and (b) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by such assigning Lender and all other amounts owed to such assigning Lender hereunder, including amounts owed pursuant to Sections 4.1 through 4.4.

Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and made its own decision to make its Extensions of Credit hereunder and enter into this Credit Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, assets, property, financial or other conditions, prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or from any losses suffered by the Agent solely as a result of the Borrower's failure to make payments as required pursuant to Section 3.4(d). If any
 
44
 
indemnity furnished to the Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of the Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The agreements in this Section 10.7 shall survive the payment of the Borrower Obligations and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Credit Documents.
 
10.8
  
Agent in Its Individual Capacity
.
 
The Agent in its individual capacity and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as though the Agent were not Agent hereunder. With respect to the Loans made and all Borrower Obligations owing to it, the Agent in its individual capacity shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit Agreement as any Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Agent in its individual capacity.
 
10.9
  
Successor Agent
.
 
The Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign as the Agent upon 30 days notice to the Lenders. If the Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agents appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agents resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken, by it while it was the Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as the Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent with the Borrowers approval, as provided for above;
provided
that the Borrowers approval shall not be required after and during the continuance of an Event of Default.

The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have.

Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all Loans, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of Revolving Fees, each payment of Funding Fees, the payment of the Up-Front Fee, each reduction of the Commitment, and each conversion or continuation of any Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with the respective Commitment Percentages;
provided
that, if any Lender shall have failed to pay its applicable pro rata share of any Loan, then any amount to which such Lender would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall instead be payable to the Agent until the share of such Loan not funded by such Lender has been repaid; and
provided
,
further
, that in the event any amount paid to any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.6 is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent, each Lender shall, upon the request of the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so paid to such Lender, with interest for the period commencing on the date such payment is returned by the Agent until the date the Agent receives such repayment at a rate per annum equal to, during the period to but excluding the date two Business Days after such request, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter, the Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum.
 
3.7
  
Computations of Interest and Fees
.
 
17
 
(a)
  
Except for Base Rate Loans, on which interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366 day year as the case may be, all computations of interest and fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.
 
(b)
  
It is the intent of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Borrower are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such documents shall be automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would, apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall, without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand payment of the Loans or any other indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not otherwise accrued on
 the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by applicable law.
 
3.8
  
Sharing of Payments
.
 
Each Lender agrees that, in the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan or any other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or otherwise (including, but not limited to, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code) in excess of its pro rata share as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Loans and other obligations, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, bankers lien, counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees
 
18
 
that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including set-off, bankers lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the amount of such participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall accrue interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is due until the day such amount is paid to the Agent or such other Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.8 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.8 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.
 
3.9
  
Evidence of Debt
.
 
(a)
  
Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.
 
(b)
  
The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of
 any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from or for the account of the Borrower and each Lenders share thereof. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.
 
(c)
  
The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.9 (and, if consistent with the entries of the Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Lender or the Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
Section 4.
  
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS REGARDING LOANS
 
4.1
  
Eurodollar Loan Provisions
.
 
(a)
  
Unavailability
. In the event that the Agent shall have determined in good faith (i) that U.S. dollar deposits in the principal amounts requested with respect to a Eurodollar Loan are not generally available in the London interbank Eurodollar market or (ii) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate, the Agent shall, as soon as practicable
 
19
 
thereafter, give notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination under clauses (i) or (ii) above, until the Agent shall have advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any request by the Borrower for Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for Base Rate Loans, (B) any request by the Borrower for conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans shall be deemed to be a request for conversion into or continuation of Base Rate Loans and (C) any Loans that were to be converted or continued as Eurodollar Loans on the first day of an Interest Period shall be converted to or continued as Base Rate Loans.
 
(b)
  
Change in Legality
. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change, after the date hereof, in any law or regulation (including the introduction of any new law or regulation) or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the Agent, such Lender may:
 
(A)
  
declare that Eurodollar Loans, and conversions to or continuations of Eurodollar Loans, will not thereafter be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Eurodollar Loans shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for, or for conversion into or continuation of, Base Rate Loans, unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
 
(B)
  
require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans made by it be converted to Base Rate Loans in which event all such Eurodollar Loans shall be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans.
 
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under clause (A) or (B) above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans made by such Lenders in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.
 
(c)
  
Requirements of Law
. If at any time a Lender shall incur increased costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to the making, the commitment to make or the maintaining of any Eurodollar Loan because of (i) any change, after the date hereof, in any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, guideline or such order) including, without limitation, the imposition, modification or deemed applicability of any reserves, deposits or similar requirements (such as, for example, but not limited to, a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) or (ii) other circumstances affecting the London interbank Eurodollar market; then the Borrower shall pay to such Lender promptly upon written demand therefore, accompanied by a statement in reasonable detail showing the calculation of the amount demanded, such additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different
 
20
 
method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender may determine in its reasonable discretion) as may be required to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts receivable hereunder. Each determination and calculation made by a Lender under this Section 4.1 shall, absent manifest error, be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. Any conversions of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall subject the Borrower to the payments required by Section 4.3. This Section shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change in or in the interpretation of law or regulation giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
 
further
that, if the change in or in the interpretation of law or regulation giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
4.2
  
Capital Adequacy
.
 
If any Lender has determined that the adoption or effectiveness, after the date hereof, of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein (after the date hereof), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or its parent corporation) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lenders (or parent corporations) capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its parent corporation) could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders (or parent corporations) policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from such Lender, accompanied by a statement in reasonable detail showing the calculation of the amount demanded, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this Section 4.2 shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. This Section shall survive termination of this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents and payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate such Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the change in or in the interpretation of law or regulation giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
 
further
that, if the change in or in the interpretation of law
 
21
 
or regulation giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
 
4.3
  
Compensation
.
 
The Borrower promises to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Credit Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto and (d) the payment, continuation or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan on a day which is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto or the failure to repay a Eurodollar Loan when required by the terms of this Credit Agreement. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to (i) an amount of interest calculated at the Eurodollar Rate which would have accrued on the amount in question, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert, continue or repay to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein minus (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurocurrency market. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
4.4
  
Taxes
.
 
(a)
  
Except as provided below in this Section 4.4, all payments made by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement and any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any court, or governmental body, agency or other official, excluding taxes measured by or imposed upon the net income of any Lender or its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, and all franchise taxes, branch taxes, taxes on doing business or taxes on the capital or net worth of any Lender or its applicable lending office, or any branch or affiliate thereof, in each case imposed in lieu of net income taxes: (i) by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or affiliate is organized or is located, or in which its principal executive office is located, or any nation within which such jurisdiction is located or any political subdivision thereof or (ii) by reason of any connection between the jurisdiction imposing such tax and such Lender, applicable lending office, branch or affiliate other than a connection arising solely from such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations, or received payment under or enforced, this Credit Agreement or any Notes. If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("
Non-Excluded Taxes
") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to an Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any Notes,
 
22
 
(A) the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Credit Agreement and any Notes,
provided
,
however
, that the Borrower shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any Non-Excluded Taxes and shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section 4.4 whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, and (B) as promptly as possible after requested, the Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes of which it has notice when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and any Lender for any incremental Non Excluded Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 4.4 shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
(b)
  
Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall:
 
(A)
  
on or before the date of any payment by the Borrower under this Credit Agreement or the Notes to such Lender, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (x) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to receive payments under this Credit Agreement and any Notes without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes and (y) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax;
 
(B)
  
deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further copies of any such form or certification on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to the Borrower; and
 
(C)
  
obtain such extensions of time for filing and complete such forms or certifications as may reasonably be requested by the Borrower or the Agent; or
 
(ii)
  
in the case of any such Lender that is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (A) represent to the Borrower (for the benefit of the Borrower and the Agent) that it is not a bank within the meaning of Section 88l(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, (B) agree to furnish to the Borrower, on or before the date of any payment by the Borrower, with a copy to the Agent, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8, or successor applicable form certifying to such Lenders legal entitlement at the date of such certificate to an exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the provisions of Section 881(c) of
 
23
 
the Internal Revenue Code with respect to payments to be made under this Credit Agreement and any Notes (and to deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two further copies of such form on or before the date it expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recently provided form and, if necessary, obtain any extensions of time reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent for filing and completing such forms), and (C) agree, to the extent legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the Borrower, to provide to the Borrower (for the benefit of the Borrower and the Agent) such other forms as may be reasonably required in order to establish the legal entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from withholding with respect to payments under this Credit Agreement and any Notes.
 
Notwithstanding the above, if any change in treaty, law or regulation has occurred after the date such Person becomes a Lender hereunder which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and such Lender so advises the Borrower and the Agent, then such Lender shall be
exempt from such requirements. Each Person that shall become a Lender or a participant of a Lender pursuant to Section 11.3 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all of the forms, certifications and statements required pursuant to this subsection (b);
provided
that in the case of a participant of a Lender, the obligations of such participant of a Lender pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be determined as if the participant of a Lender were a Lender except that such participant of a Lender shall furnish all such required forms, certifications and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.
 
4.5
  
Replacement of Lenders
.
 
The Agent and each Lender shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate any increased cost or suspension of the availability of an interest rate under Sections 4.1 through 4.4 above to the greatest extent practicable (including transferring the Loans to another lending office of Affiliate of a Lender) unless, in the opinion of the Agent or such Lender, such efforts would be likely to have an adverse effect upon it. In the event a Lender makes a request to the Borrower for additional payments in accordance with Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.4, then, provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, the Borrower may, at its own expense (such expense to include any transfer fee payable to the Agent under Section 11.3(b) and any expense pursuant to Section 4) and in its sole discretion, require such Lender to transfer and assign in whole (but not in part), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.3(b)), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (a) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority and (b) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the portion of the Loans hereunder held by such assigning Lender and all other amounts owed to such assigning Lender hereunder, including amounts owed pursuant to Sections 4.1 through 4.4.
