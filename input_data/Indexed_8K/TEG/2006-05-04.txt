Overall, we produced solid results in the first quarter, led by WPS Energy Services 32% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth, stated Larry Weyers, WPS Resources' Chairman, President, and CEO. WPS Energy Services continues to produce strong results from wholesale electric operations while maintaining risk within approved parameters, and its wholesale natural gas operations benefited from volatile natural gas prices in the first quarter, which increased the value of products provided to customers. Due to
WPS Energy Services diverse mix of wholesale and retail product offerings in multiple markets, combined with disciplined execution and exit strategies, the nonregulated business continued to produce significant economic value and earnings. We look forward to continued strong performance from WPS Energy Services.
Unfortunately, residential customer conservation efforts and mild weather conditions experienced at our utility operations in the first quarter reduced customer consumption, which led to lower than expected earnings from our utility operations. Transition costs associated with the acquisitions of Aquila Inc.s retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota also negatively impacted utility earnings, added Weyers.

Segments
WPS Resources' Electric Utility segment includes the regulated electric utility operations of two wholly owned utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Upper Peninsula Power Company. The Gas Utility segment consists of the natural gas utility operations of Wisconsin Public Service as well as certain transition costs related to the April 1, 2006 acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and the anticipated closing of the acquisition of the retail natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota. On April 1, 2006, WPS Resources completed the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan from Aquila, Inc. and anticipates completing the acquisition of Aquila, Inc.s natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota this summer.
WPS Energy Services, Inc., a diversified energy supply, generation, and services company, offers nonregulated natural gas, electric, and alternative fuel supplies, as well as energy management and consulting services to retail and wholesale customers. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, WPS Resources reported two nonregulated segments,
WPS Energy Services and WPS Power Development. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2005, WPS Resources began reporting one nonregulated segment, WPS Energy Services. Segment information related to prior periods has been reclassified to reflect this change.
The Holding Company and Other segment includes the operations of the WPS Resources holding company and the non-utility activities of Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. Equity earnings from the companys investments in ATC, Wisconsin River Power Company, and Guardian Pipeline, LLC are also included in the Holding Company and Other Segment.
First Quarter Financial Results
Electric Utility Segment Earnings
Electric utility earnings decreased $8.0 million, from $23.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, to $15.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The decrease in electric utility earnings was primarily due to the negative impact both residential customer

conservation efforts and warmer weather conditions had on the electric utility margin in the first quarter of 2006, compared to the same quarter in 2005. Residential customers are taking measures to conserve energy as a result of recent rate increases driven by higher commodity prices. Weather was also approximately 11% warmer during the heating season, compared to the first quarter of 2005. Unfortunately, these factors could not be predicted when the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued a final order authorizing an annual retail electric rate increase of $79.9 million (10.1%), effective January 1, 2006.
Natural Gas Utility Segment Earnings
Natural gas utility earnings decreased $7.3 million, from $14.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, to $6.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, primarily due to an $8.8 million increase in operating and maintenance expenses, which was driven by
$4.1 million of transition costs incurred in the first quarter (discussed above), and an increase in the write-off of uncollectible customer accounts related primarily to high natural gas prices. Natural gas margins decreased by $1.5 million, reflecting the impact of the warmer weather that resulted in an approximate $3.4 million decrease in margin, as well as residential customer conservation efforts due to high natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by a natural gas rate increase. In December 2005, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued a final order authorizing an annual retail natural gas rate increase of $7.2 million (1.1%), effective January 1, 2006. The rate increase was required as a result of infrastructure improvements necessary to ensure the reliability of the natural gas distribution system.
WPS Energy Services Segment Earnings
WPS Energy Services earnings increased $8.9 million, from $28.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, to $37.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Higher earnings were driven by a $34.1 million increase in margin, partially offset by an
$8.3 million decrease in Section 29/45K tax credits recognized and a $3.9 million increase in operating expenses. WPS Energy Services margin increased due, in part, to the continued strong performance of its wholesale operations. WPS Energy Services continues to produce strong results from portfolio optimization and trading activities related to wholesale electric operations, while maintaining risk within approved parameters. Wholesale natural gas operations benefited from the increased volatility in natural gas prices, which increased opportunities to deliver high value structured natural gas products to wholesale customers. Additionally, wholesale natural gas margins benefited from high natural gas storage spreads, as future natural gas sales prices were higher than the near-term price of natural gas, creating profitable natural gas storage opportunities. An increase in mark-to-market and realized gains on derivative instruments utilized to protect a portion of WPS Energy Services Section 29/45K federal tax credits also contributed to the increase in margin, but was offset by a decrease in retail electric operations, primarily in Michigan and Ohio.
The amount of Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized in the first quarter of 2006 from WPS Energy Services ownership interest in a synthetic fuel production facility decreased compared to the same period in 2005 due to the anticipated impact high oil

prices may have on WPS Energy Services ability to realize the benefit of these tax credits and also due to the timing of recognizing tax credits in interim financial statements as required by generally accepted accounting principles. The company estimates that an additional $4.9 million of tax credits would have been recognized in the first quarter of 2006 absent a projected production curtailment and a projected tax credit phase-out. 
WPS Energy Services has mitigated substantially all of the phase-out risk associated with 2006 Section 29/45K federal tax credits through the use of derivative instruments. Mark-to-market and realized gains on the 2006 oil options contributed to the increase in margin, discussed above.
Operating and maintenance expenses at WPS Energy Services increased $3.9 million, largely due to higher payroll and benefit costs related to continued business expansion.
Detailed explanations related to the change in WPS Energy Services margin and more information on Section 29/45K tax credits and the impact of the anticipated phase-out on first quarter 2006 income tax expense will be available in WPS Resources first quarter report on Form 10-Q that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission later today.
Holding Company and Other Segment Earnings
Earnings at the Holding Company and Other segment increased $0.6 million, from $0.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, to $0.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to a $3.7 million increase in pre-tax earnings from ATC, substantially offset by a $2.7 million increase in operating expenses.
Average Shares of Common Stock
The change in diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase of 2.5 million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of WPS Resources' common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared to the same quarter in 2005. WPS Resources' issuance of 1.9 million additional shares of common stock through a public offering in November 2005 was the primary contributor to the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Additional shares were also issued in 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006 under the Stock Investment Plan and certain stock-based employee benefit plans.
2006 EARNINGS FORECAST
In 2006, the company is continuing to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its utility and nonregulated operations, while maintaining an emphasis on regulated growth. The companys emphasis on regulated growth has been demonstrated by the on-going expansion of its generation fleet, as well as the acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan on April 1, 2006, and the anticipated acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Minnesota. The expansion of the utility generation fleet is aimed at meeting the high level of reliability expected by the companys customers and ensuring that the company continues to meet anticipated growth in electric demand. In all of the companys business units, financial tools commonly used in the industry are utilized to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and

customers. Also, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions. The companys long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target remains at 6% to 8% on an average annualized basis, with fluctuations in any given year that may be above or below that targeted range. The 2006 guidance has been raised to between $3.54 and $3.98 diluted earnings per share, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, availability of generation units, completion of asset management sales, and successful completion of the acquisition of the Minnesota natural gas distribution operations. Diluted earnings per share guidance reflects the companys estimate of transition costs of about $14 million (approximately
$9 million after-tax) related to the acquisitions of natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota. The guidance also includes about $6.4 million (approximately $3.8 million after-tax) of increased purchased power costs for WPS Energy Services customers in Maine. Diluted earnings per share guidance does not reflect potential future mark-to-market gains or losses on derivative instruments utilized to protect the anticipated value of a portion of Section 29/45K tax credits in 2007.
