FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Green Bay, WI - May 10, 2006 - WPS Resources Corporation (NYSE: WPS) announced today that it has exercised its rights under a forward sale agreement with an affiliate of J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. that was entered into in November 2005 as part of its public offering of 4,600,000 shares of common stock at $53.70. Under terms of the agreement, J. P. Morgan (as agent for its affiliate), as the forward purchaser borrowed and sold 2,700,000 shares, or 58.7% of the November 2005 public offering, of WPS Resources common stock. WPS Resources had the right to elect physical or cash settlement of the forward sale agreement within approximately one year of the date of the public offering. The forward sale agreement was physically settled at approximately $51.72 per share (net proceeds per share after underwriters fees and other adjustments), for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $139.6 million. The proceeds will be used to partially finance the acquisition of the Michigan and Minnesota natural gas distribution operations from Aquila, Inc. and for general corporate purposes.
As of May 10, 2006, upon completion of the physical settlement of this transaction, WPS Resources had 43,016,636 shares of its common stock outstanding.
