As a result of the Company's dividend increase, the intended combined company dividend of $0.66 per quarter would provide a 14.8% increase to the Company's new quarterly dividend of $0.575 per share.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
