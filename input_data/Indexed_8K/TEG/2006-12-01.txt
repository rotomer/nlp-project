Indemnification of the Underwriters.
    (b)        Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following information included in the Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the paragraph under the caption "UnderwritingOffering Price, Concessions and Reallowances," the information contained under the caption "UnderwritingPrice Stabilization and Penalty Bids;" the information contained under the caption "UnderwritingElectronic Prospectus Delivery;" and the information furnished on behalf of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC as applicable, in the paragraph under the caption "UnderwritingOther Relationships."
Indemnification of the Company.
    (c)        If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

further
    (d)        If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
    (e)        The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.

Effectiveness of Agreement
    9.        . This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Termination
    10.        . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
    (b)        If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.
pro
rata
    (c)        If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.
    (d)        Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
    11.        (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company's counsel and independent accountants; (v) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); and (vii) all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors.
Payment of Expenses
.
    (b)        If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the Company agrees to reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
    12.        . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase.
Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement
    13.        . The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or the Underwriters.

        Such counsel shall also state that they have participated in conferences with representatives of the Company and with representatives of its independent accountants and counsel at which conferences the contents of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus and any amendment and supplement thereto and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto (except as expressly provided above), nothing has come to the attention of such counsel to cause such counsel to believe that the Registration Statement, at the time of its effective date (including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C to be part of the Registration Statement at the time of effectiveness), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which such counsel may assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as of its date and the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than, in each case, the financial statements, related schedules and other financial data or financial statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein, as to which such counsel need express no belief).
        In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
        The opinion of Foley & Lardner LLP described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.

        (c)  Additional Junior Subordinated Notes may, without the consent of the holders of the then Outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes, be authenticated and delivered in the manner provided in Section 3.03 of the Base Indenture. Any such additional Junior Subordinated Notes will have the same Stated Maturity and other terms, and shall be consolidated with and form part of the same series, as the Junior Subordinated Notes initially issued under this First Supplemental Indenture, except that in the case of any such additional Junior Subordinated Notes that are issued following the initial Interest Payment Date, interest shall first begin to accrue on such additional Junior Subordinated Notes on the Interest Payment Date immediately preceding the date of issuance of such additional Junior Subordinated Notes.
     The date on which the principal of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be due and payable is December 1, 2066, which may not be shortened or extended.
2.2
Stated Maturity.
    2.3 Form and Payment; Depositary.
        (a)  The Junior Subordinated Notes shall be issued in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

        (a)  Each Junior Subordinated Note will bear interest at (i) the rate of 6.11% per annum (the "Fixed Interest Rate") from the date of its issuance up to, but not including, December 1, 2016 or earlier Redemption Date (the "Fixed Rate Period"), and (ii) the Three-Month LIBOR Rate plus 212 basis points (2.12%), reset quarterly on the LIBOR Rate Reset Dates (the "Floating Interest Rate" and, together with the Fixed Interest Rate, the "Interest Rate"), from December 1, 2016 up to, but not including, the Stated Maturity or earlier Redemption Date (the "Floating Rate Period"), and will bear interest on any overdue principal at the then prevailing Interest Rate and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the then prevailing Interest Rate ("Additional Interest"), compounded semi-annually for the Fixed Rate Period and quarterly for the Floating Rate Period, payable (subject to the provisions of Article IV) semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year during the Fixed Rate Period, beginning June 1, 2007, and quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year during the Floating Rate Period, beginning March 1, 2017 (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), to the Person in whose name such Junior Subordinated Note is registered, subject to certain exceptions, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
        (b)  During the Fixed Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any semi-annual interest accrual period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and during the Floating Rate Period, the amount of interest payable for any quarterly interest accrual period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the interest period (determined by including the first day of the interest period and excluding the last day of the interest period) divided by 360. During the Fixed Rate Period, if an Interest Payment Date or a Redemption Date of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or the Redemption Date, as applicable. During the Floating Rate Period, if any Interest Payment Date, other than a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the Interest Payment Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. Also, if a Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of interest and principal will be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and no interest on such payment will accrue for the period from and after the Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity, as applicable. During the Floating Rate Period, if any LIBOR Rate Reset Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, the LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the immediately preceding Business Day. During the Floating Rate Period, the interest rate in effect on any LIBOR Rate Reset Date will be the applicable interest rate as reset on that date and the interest rate applicable to any other day will be the interest rate as reset on the immediately preceding LIBOR Rate Reset Date.
     For purposes of the Junior Subordinated Notes only, clause (3) of Section 5.01 of the Base Indenture shall not apply, and clause (1) of Section 5.01 of the Base Indenture shall be amended to read as follows: "(1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on any Junior Subordinated Note when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days (subject to the Company's rights pursuant to Article IV of the First Supplemental Indenture to optionally defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes); or." For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes shall be an Event of Default except those that are specifically identified as an Event of Default.

2.6
Certain Covenants Do Not Apply to Junior Subordinated Notes.

A deferral of interest payments may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the Company may not begin a new Optional Deferral Period until it has paid all accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes from the previous Optional Deferral Period.
        (b)  Any interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes that has been deferred by the Company pursuant to Section 4.1(a) will accrue Additional Interest at a rate equal to the Interest Rate then applicable to the Junior Subordinated Notes, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Once the Company pays all deferred interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes, including any Additional Interest, it shall be entitled to again defer interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to Section 4.1(a), but not beyond the Stated Maturity of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
