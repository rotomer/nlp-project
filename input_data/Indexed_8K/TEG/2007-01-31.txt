There were a number of positive developments in the fourth quarter.  Our regulated electric operations produced slightly better results than last year despite warmer than normal weather conditions, while our regulated natural gas distribution operations experienced the positive contribution generated at our newly acquired natural gas operations in Michigan and Minnesota,  stated Larry Weyers, WPS Resources' Chairman, President, and CEO.  At our nonregulated operations, we continue to make strong inroads into new markets including Illinois and Texas, which helped to drive substantial increases in forward contract volumes during the fourth quarter.  Although financial results at our nonregulated operations were unfavorably impacted this quarter by non-cash mark-to-market losses on our derivative instruments used to protect the economic value of our natural gas and electric supply contracts, largely due to a drop in energy prices, the same price drop enhanced our ability to sign up new customers and increase transaction volumes.  As we deliver on these contracts and unwind the associated derivative instruments, our financial results in future periods will reflect the economic value that has been created.   
We made tremendous strides in 2006, including integrating the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota acquired in April and July, respectively. We also
announced the proposed merger with Peoples Energy. These acquisitions allow us to

further our strategy, added Weyers. Our strategy of providing a high level of service to our customers, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and developing a dedicated employee base has allowed us to grow our operations and deliver value to our shareholders.
The following tables depict income available for common shareholders and revenue for the comparable fourth quarters and comparable years ended December 31.

Segments
WPS Resources' Electric Utility segment includes the regulated electric utility operations of two wholly owned utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Upper Peninsula Power Company. The Gas Utility segment consists of the natural gas utility operations of Wisconsin Public Service, Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation and Michigan Gas Utilities Corporation.
WPS Energy Services, Inc., a diversified energy supply, generation, and services company, offers nonregulated natural gas, electric, and alternative fuel supplies, as well as energy management and consulting services, to retail and wholesale customers in the Midwest and Northeastern United States, Texas, and portions of Canada that are adjacent to areas in the United States where WPS Energy Services conducts business. 
WPS Energy Services also owns several merchant electric generation plants, primarily in the Midwest and Northeastern United States and adjacent portions of Canada.

The Holding Company and Other segment includes the operations of the WPS Resources holding company and the non-utility activities of Wisconsin Public Service, Upper Peninsula Power, Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. Equity earnings from the companys investments in ATC and Wisconsin River Power Company are also included in the Holding Company and Other Segment. WPS Resources divested its investment in Guardian Pipeline, LLC in the second quarter of 2006.
Discontinued Operations
In July 2006, WPS Energy Services sold Sunbury Generation, LLC to Corona Power, LLC. Sunbury Generations primary asset was the Sunbury generation plant, located in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania. The gross proceeds received from the plant were approximately $34 million with a total after-tax gain of $12.5 million. Beginning in the second quarter of 2006, WPS Energy Services began reporting the assets and liabilities of Sunbury that were transferred to Corona Power, LLC as held for sale and also reported Sunburys results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations. Prior periods have also been reclassified, as applicable, to reflect this change in presentation.
In the near future, WPS Energy Services expects to complete the sale of WPS Niagara Generation, LLC (Niagara), for approximately $30 million, subject to post closing adjustments. The pre-tax gain on this transaction is expected to be approximately $25 million and will be reported in the first quarter of 2007 as a component of discontinued operations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006, WPS Energy Services began reporting the assets and liabilities of Niagara that were transferred in the sale as held for sale and reported its results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified, as applicable, to reflect this change in presentation.
Fourth
Quarter and Calendar Year Financial Results
Electric Utility Segment Earnings
Electric utility earnings increased by $23.8 million to $15.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to a loss of $8.2 million for the comparable quarter in 2005. Earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 included a pre-tax write-off of approximately $13.7 million of regulatory assets associated with a regulatory ruling from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin that disallowed the recovery of certain costs that had been deferred related to the 2004 Kewaunee nuclear plant outage, as well as a portion of the loss on the sale of the Kewaunee plant. Electric utility earnings also improved during the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of improved recovery of fuel and purchased power costs (discussed below) and approved rate increases implemented at Wisconsin Public Service (effective January 1, 2006) and Upper Peninsula Power (effective June 28, 2006), as well as a 3.2% increase in sales volumes.

Electric margins rose $2.6 million to $122.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $120.0 million for the comparable quarter in 2005, primarily due to the implementation of rate increases and higher sales volumes previously mentioned.
For the year, electric utility earnings increased $21.3 million in 2006 to $85.5 million, compared to $64.2 million in 2005, due to improved recovery of fuel and purchased power costs (which contributed an estimated $14 million after-tax increase to earnings), the implementation of rate increases at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power and the write-off associated with the Kewaunee nuclear plant previously mentioned. The favorable variances were partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions in 2006, which caused an estimated $9 million after-tax decrease in earnings in 2006 compared to 2005.
Natural Gas Utility Segment Earnings
During the fourth quarter of 2006, income available for shareholders from the regulated gas utility operations rose 107% to $9.5 million, compared to $4.6 million during the comparable quarter in 2005. The 2006 fourth quarter results include $4.6 million in after-tax income, including $0.8 million in after-tax transition expenses, from the newly acquired natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota.
Natural gas margins increased by $36.2 million, or 102%, to $71.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $35.5 million for the same quarter in 2005, with approximately $35.5 million being added from the newly acquired operations.
For the year, the natural gas utility segment produced a net loss of $2.3 million in 2006, compared to earnings of $13.2 million in 2005. The newly acquired natural gas distribution operations produced an after-tax loss of $11.3 million in 2006, which included $7.1 million in after-tax transition costs. The after-tax loss relating to the recently acquired operations was due in part to the timing of the close of the acquisitions, which occurred after the end of a significant portion of the heating season earlier in 2006.
WPS Energy Services Segment Earnings
.
WPS Energy Services earnings declined $19.4 million, to $0.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, from $20.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005. Margins declined $21.4 million. Total net mark-to-market losses were $26.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to net mark-to-market gains of $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The change was driven largely by accounting rules which dictate the timing associated with the recognition of gains and losses on retail supply transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These retail electric supply contracts protect the economic value of customer sales contracts. The offsetting impact of these gains and losses will be reflected in future periods.
Synthetic fuel activities generated an after-tax net gain of $1.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to an after-tax net loss of $0.6 million in the comparable quarter

of 2005. This was due to a $7.5 million increase in Section 29/45K tax credits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same quarter in 2005, which was partially offset by a $1.8 million increase in net after-tax losses on oil options used to protect the economic value of synthetic fuel tax credits in 2007. (See page 4 of the Supplemental Quarterly Financial Highlights for more information.)
The 2005 fourth quarter results were impacted by solid results from the companys discontinued operations; higher energy prices, which resulted in significant mark-to-market gains on certain derivative instruments; and a gain associated with the liquidation of an electric supply contract in Maine during the fourth quarter 2005.
Earnings for the full year declined $1.8 million to $72.3 million in 2006 compared to
$74.1 million in 2005. The decrease in earnings was the result of an $11.0 million increase in interest expense due to higher working capital requirements associated with the growth in natural gas operations, a $10.6 million increase in other expenses, primarily associated with increased tons procured from a synthetic fuel facility, and a $4.2 million after-tax decrease in income from discontinued operations. These decreases were partially offset by a $14.4 million increase in margin, a $6.7 million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses, and a $3.4 million increase in Section 29/45K federal tax credits recognized.
Detailed explanations related to the change in WPS Energy Services margin and more information on Section 29/45K tax credits will be available in WPS Resources Form 10-K that is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by
February 28, 2007.
Holding Company and Other Segment Earnings
The Holding Company and Other segment produced an after-tax net loss of $4.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to after-tax income of $2.9 million for the comparable quarter in 2005. The decline in earnings was due, in part, to higher interest expense resulting from an increase in borrowings to finance the companys acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota and a decrease in gains from land sales. Also contributing to the loss were $1.3 million of after-tax external transition costs and other costs related to the pending merger with Peoples Energy. Partially offsetting the loss was a $1.6 million increase in after-tax equity earnings recognized from the companys investment in ATC.
The Holding Company and Other segment generated after-tax income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to after-tax income of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Higher interest and operating costs were offset by pre-tax equity earnings from ATC, which increased to $39.0 million in 2006 from
$25.1 million in 2005, and a $6.2 million pre-tax gain recognized in 2006 from the sale of the companys interest in Guardian Pipeline, LLC.

Average Shares of Common Stock
The change in diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of WPS Resources' common stock for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, of 4.0 million and 3.7 million shares, respectively compared to the same periods in 2005. WPS Resources issued 1.9 million shares of common stock through a public offering in November 2005 and also issued 2.7 million shares of common stock in May 2006 when it elected to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. Additional shares were also issued under the Stock Investment Plan and certain stock-based employee benefit plans.
200
7 EARNINGS FORECAST
In 2007, WPS Resources Corporation is continuing to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its utility and nonregulated operations, while maintaining an emphasis on regulated growth. The companys emphasis on regulated growth has been demonstrated by the on-going expansion of its generation fleet, as well as the acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota during 2006 and the pending merger with Peoples Energy Corporation. The expansion of the utility generation fleet is aimed at meeting the high level of reliability expected by the companys customers and ensuring that the company continues to meet anticipated growth in electric demand. In all of the companys business units, financial tools commonly used in the industry are utilized to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and customers. Also, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions. The companys long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target remains at 6% to 8% on an average annualized basis, with fluctuations in any given year that may be above or below that targeted range.
The companys 2007 guidance is between $4.55 and $4.78 diluted earnings per share (includes discontinued operations), assuming normal weather for the 2007 calendar year, availability of generation units, and completion of asset management sales. The diluted earnings per share guidance reflects WPS Resources as a stand-alone company and does not take into consideration the merger with Peoples Energy Corporation
.
After the merger is completed, it is anticipated that Integrys Energy Group (Integrys), the name of the combined company after the pending merger, will provide information on future earnings guidance for Integrys. Additionally, the diluted earnings per share guidance does not include the impact of mark-to-market activity, except for certain mark-to-market activity related to business originating prior to 2007, which will be completed in 2007.
The projected guidance range for 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted is anticipated to be between $3.45 and $3.62 compared with $3.17 actual diluted earnings per share in 2006 from continuing operations - adjusted. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted guidance excludes certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please see the attached Diluted

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
n
 
WPS Resources prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations - adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure. Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors. We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events. Management believes that diluted EPS from continuing operations - adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
