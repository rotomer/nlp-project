Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 5, 2007, Integrys Energy Group, Inc. announced that it had entered into a First Supplemental Indenture with Peoples Energy Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary, and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The Supplemental Indenture permits Integrys Energy Group to substitute the financial reports that it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission for Peoples Energys financial reports that were required to be supplied to Peoples Energys bondholders. In addition, the terms of the Supplemental Indenture provide that Integrys Energy Group will fully and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, Peoples Energys obligations under its $325 million, 6.90% Notes due January 15, 2011. The original Indenture, dated January 18, 2001, was between Peoples Energy Corporation and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.
As a result of Integrys Energy Groups guaranty and the related amendment to the bond provisions approved by bondholders on February 28, 2007, Peoples Energy will suspend its duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Attached, as Exhibit 4.1, is the First Supplemental Indenture, dated March 5, 2007, by and among Peoples Energy Corporation, Integrys Energy Group, Inc. and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.

WHEREAS
, Integrys desires to fully and unconditionally guarantee the due and punctual payment obligations of PEC with respect to the Notes as long as the Notes remain Outstanding;
 
WHEREAS
, Section 902 of the Original Indenture provides, among other things, that PEC, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee, at any time and from time to time, may enter into an indenture supplemental to the Original Indenture with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture; and
 
WHEREAS

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, PEC, Integrys, and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders as follows:
 
 
 
Section 101.
  
Capitalized Terms
. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Original Indenture.
 
Section 102.
  
Guaranty
. Integrys does hereby fully and unconditionally guarantee for the benefit of the Holders and the Trustee (the 
Guaranty
) (a) the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, all the Notes, whether at Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, the due and punctual payment of interest on overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all of the Notes, if any, and the due and punctual performance of all other obligations of PEC to the Holders or the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any such other obligations, that the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise.
 
In case of the failure of PEC to punctually make any such payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, Integrys hereby agrees to cause any such payment to be made promptly when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by PEC.
 
Integrys hereby agrees that its obligations under the Guaranty shall be as if it were principal debtor and not merely surety, and shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any Note or the Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any Note or the Indenture, or any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to PEC with respect thereto, by the Holder of any Note or the Trustee, or any other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification, or indulgence shall, without the consent of Integrys, increase the principal amount of a Note or the interest rate thereon or increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof. Integrys hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of a merger or bankruptcy of PEC, any right to require a proceeding first against PEC, protest or notice with respect to any Note or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect to any sinking fund payment required pursuant to the terms of a Note issued under the Indenture, and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that the Guaranty will not be discharged with respect to any Note except by payment in full of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on such Note. The Guaranty shall constitute a guaranty of payment and not of collection and shall not be impaired by the failure to endorse evidence of the Guaranty on any Note.
 
Integrys shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of a Note against PEC in respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by Integrys pursuant to the provisions of the Guaranty; provided, however, that Integrys shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all Notes have been paid in full.

Section 103.
  
Restrictions on Liens
 
After the date of the First Supplemental Indenture and so long as any Notes are Outstanding, Integrys will not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant a security interest in, or permit any mortgage, pledge, security interest or other lien upon, any capital stock of any Integrys Subsidiary now or hereafter directly or indirectly owned by Integrys to secure any Indebtedness (hereinafter defined), without making effective provisions whereby the Outstanding Notes shall be (so long as such other Indebtedness shall be so secured) equally and ratably secured with any and all such other Indebtedness and any other indebtedness similarly entitled to be equally and ratably secured; provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to nor prevent the creation or existence of (i) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance upon any such capital stock (A) created at the time of the acquisition of such capital stock by Integrys or within one year after such time to secure all or a portion of the purchase price for such capital stock or (B) existing thereon at the time of the acquisition thereof by Integrys (whether or not the obligations secured thereby are assumed by Integrys), or (ii) any extension, renewal or refunding of any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance described in clause (i) above on capital stock of any Integrys Subsidiary theretofore subject thereto (or substantially the same capital stock) or any portion thereof.

All indebtedness for money borrowed of others guaranteed as to payment of principal by Integrys or any Integrys Subsidiary or in effect guaranteed by Integrys or such Integrys Subsidiary through a contingent agreement to purchase such indebtedness for money borrowed shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 103 to be Indebtedness of Integrys or such Integrys Subsidiary, but no other contingent obligation of Integrys or any Integrys Subsidiary in respect of indebtedness for money borrowed or other obligations incurred by others shall for purposes of this Section 103 be deemed to be Indebtedness of Integrys or such Integrys Subsidiary.
 
In case Integrys or any Integrys Subsidiary shall propose to pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant a security interest in any capital stock of any Integrys Subsidiary owned by Integrys or such Integrys Subsidiary to secure any Indebtedness, other than as permitted by clauses (i) and (ii) in the second preceding paragraph, Integrys will prior thereto give written notice thereof to the Trustee, and Integrys will prior to or simultaneously with such pledge, mortgage, hypothecation or grant of security interest, by supplemental indenture executed to the Trustee (or to the extent legally necessary to another trustee or an additional or separate trustee), in form satisfactory to the Trustee, effectively secure (for so long as other Indebtedness shall be secured) all the Notes equally and ratably with such Indebtedness and with any other indebtedness for money borrowed similarly entitled to be equally and ratably secured.
