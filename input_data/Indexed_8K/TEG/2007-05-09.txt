Chicago, IL - May 9, 2007 - Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG), an operator of regulated natural gas and electric utilities and nonregulated energy related business units, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.
On February 21, 2007, WPS Resources Corporation (WPS Resources) completed its merger with Peoples Energy Corporation (Peoples Energy) and changed its name to Integrys Energy Group, Inc.

The first quarter of 2007 was filled with accomplishments, including completing the merger with Peoples Energy, filing rate cases in Illinois, and producing strong results, stated Larry Weyers, Integrys Energy Groups President and CEO.  Since the close of the merger, our integration teams have made significant progress executing their integration plans.    
 
As we look toward the remainder of 2007, we will be focused on completing the integration of our nonregulated operations during the third quarter and establishing a new services company during the latter portion of the year. The services company will provide shared services to our utility and nonregulated operations. Our goal is to produce diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.55 for 2007, which includes $0.26 decrease in diluted earnings per share from the impact of Peoples merger transition costs, $0.14 decrease in diluted earnings per share from the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger, and positive results of discontinued operations of between $0.85 and $0.86 diluted earnings per share. For 2008, we see our diluted earnings per share rising to a range of $3.67 to $3.94, including merger transition expenses and the negative impacts relating to purchase accounting adjustments, added Weyers. Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted excludes the negative $0.16 diluted earnings per share impact of merger transition costs and the negative $0.10 diluted earnings per share impact of purchase accounting adjustments and are expected to be in the range of $3.93 to $4.20. Our strategy of providing a high level of service to our customers, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and developing a dedicated employee base has provided us with a strong foundation to grow our operations and deliver value to our shareholders.
 
The following table depicts income available for common shareholders and revenue for the comparable first quarters ended March 31.

Discontinued Operations
In connection with the February 21, 2007, merger with Peoples Energy, Integrys Energy Group announced its intent to divest Peoples Energy Production Company, its oil and gas business. The divestiture will allow Integrys Energy Group to focus on its core businesses, reduce external financing requirements, and reduce Integrys Energy Group's risk profile. It is anticipated that the divestiture will be completed by the end of 2007. During the quarter ended March 31, 2007, the oil and gas segment recorded after-tax earnings of $8.2 million as a component of discontinued operations.
During the past twelve months Integrys Energy Services sold WPS Niagara Generation, LLC and Sunbury Generation, LLC. Results from these entities have been reflected in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations related to WPS Niagara Generation, LLC increased from after-tax earnings of $0.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2006, to after-tax earnings of $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in income generated from WPS Niagara Generation LLC was due to the $14.8 million after-tax gain recorded on the sale of this facility in the first quarter of 2007. During July 2006, Sunbury Generation, LLC was sold. During the first quarter of 2006, Sunbury recorded earnings of $1.2 million, which is reflected as a component of discontinued operations.
First Quarter Financial Results
 
Electric Utility Segment Earnings
Electric utility earnings increased by $1.0 million to $16.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, from $15.5 million for the comparable quarter in 2006. Electric utility earnings improved during the first quarter of 2007 as a result of approved retail rate increases implemented at Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (effective January 12, 2007) and Upper Peninsula Power Company (effective June 28, 2006). Sales volumes also increased 2.8% during the first quarter of 2007 versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by a 6.9% increase in heating degree days and an increase in weather-normalized use per customer. The colder weather conditions contributed approximately an additional $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, to electric segment earnings.
Electric margins rose $18.2 million to $148.9 million during the first quarter of 2007, compared with $130.7 million for the comparable quarter in 2006, primarily due to the implementation of rate increases and higher sales volumes previously mentioned.
Partially offsetting the increased margins was $15.0 million in increased operating and maintenance expenses, which included $4.8 million in pre-tax external transition costs associated with the recently completed merger with Peoples Energy, $4.0 million in additional electric transmission expenses, a $3.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, and a $3.8 million increase in maintenance

expenses largely due to planned maintenance at Wisconsin Public Services Weston 2 generation station.
 
Natural Gas Utility Segment Earnings
During the first quarter of 2007, the results from the regulated natural gas utility operations reflected the added contribution of the acquired natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota and, beginning on February 22, 2007, the impact of The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and North Shore Gas Company. Natural gas utility earnings increased $28.5 million to $35.2 million during the first quarter of 2007, compared to $6.7 million during the comparable quarter in 2006. The 2007 results included approximately $2.0 million in pre-tax external transition costs associated with the recently completed Peoples Energy merger. Approximately $11.9 million in after-tax income was generated at the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota, which included $0.5 million in pre-tax external transition costs this quarter related to the acquisitions that closed in 2006. The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and North Shore Gas Company contributed about $7.4 million in after-tax income to this segment. After-tax earnings at the natural gas utility operations of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation rose $5.2 million to $15.9 million during the first quarter of 2007, compared with $10.7 million during the comparable quarter last year, due to an increase in volumes to residential and commercial and industrial customers, due in part to a 6.9% increase in heating degree days in the first quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter last year and an increase in average weather-normalized use per customer.
Natural gas utility margins increased $127.1 million to $171.9 million during the first quarter of 2007, compared with $44.8 million for the same quarter in 2006. Approximately $69 million was contributed by The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and North Shore Gas Company and about $48 million was added from the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota. The colder weather conditions discussed contributed approximately an additional $1.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, to Wisconsin Public Service Corporations natural gas earnings.
 
Integrys Energy Services Segment Earnings
Integrys Energy Services earnings rose $42.6 million, to $79.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, from $37.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Margins increased $29.3 million. Total mark-to-market gains on derivative instruments used to protect the economic value of retail electric and natural gas supply and customer sales contracts and Section 29/45K tax credits were $56.2 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2007, compared with net mark-to-market gains of $31.8 million pre-tax in the first quarter of 2006. Accounting rules dictate the timing associated with the recognition of gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Retail electric and natural gas supply contracts are used to protect the economic value of customer sales contracts. The ultimate margin related to these contracts will be recognized when the energy is delivered, until that time the fluctuation in the value of the derivative supply contracts will be reflected in future periods.

Synthetic fuel activities generated an after-tax net income of $19.0 million during the first quarter of 2007, including $20.6 million in Section 29/45K federal tax credits and an after-tax operating loss of $2.8 million at the companys synthetic fuel facility. During the first quarter of 2006, synthetic fuel activities contributed $9.7 million to net income (see page 4 of the Supplemental Quarterly Financial Highlights for more information). The higher tax credits resulted primarily from the impact of accounting rules associated with accounting for income taxes in interim financial statements. In light of the fact that the company realized more than half of its expected income for 2007 in the first quarter of 2007, it recognized more than half of its expected tax credits in the first quarter due to the use of the annual effective tax rate.
Excluding the impacts of mark-to-market gains, Integrys Energy Services gross margins increased 6.9 million dollars on a pre-tax basis.
Forward contracted electric sales volume at Integrys Energy Services rose to 74.6 million megawatt-hours at the end of the first quarter of 2007 compared with 29.9 million megawatt-hours at the end of the first quarter of 2006. Forward contracted natural gas sales volumes rose to 510 billion cubic feet on March 31, 2007 compared to 420 billion cubic feet on March 31, 2006. The increase in volume was driven largely from growth in customer-based retail and wholesale origination activities, including the company's expansion into new markets in Texas and Illinois and ramp-up of activity in the Midwest and Northeast. Approximately 60% of the forward electric volumes and over 70% of the forward natural gas volumes are contracted to be delivered within one year.
Detailed explanations related to the change in Integrys Energy Services margin and more information on Section 29/45K tax credits will be available in Integrys Energy Groups Form 10-Q that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
 
Holding Company and Other Segment Earnings
The Holding Company and Other segment broke even during the first quarter of 2007 compared with earnings of $0.8 million in the comparable quarter in 2006, due to increased interest expense associated with the higher debt levels that resulted from the acquisition of the natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota and increased working capital requirements at the nonregulated operations. The increased interest expense was partially offset by a $7.8 million decrease in operating expenses associated with the allocation of transition costs to achieve merger synergy savings incurred prior to the first quarter of 2007 from the Holding Company and Other segment to the other reportable segments that will ultimately benefit from the synergy savings resulting from these costs to achieve.
 
Integrys Energy Group also recorded a 34%, or $1.8 million, quarter-over-quarter increase in after-tax equity earnings, to $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared with $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2006, from the companys investment in ATC.

Average Shares of Common Stock
Diluted earnings per share was impacted by the items discussed above as well as an increase of 17.2 million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of Integrys Energy Group's common stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared with the same quarter in 2006. Integrys Energy Group issued 31.9 million shares on February 21, 2007, in conjunction with the merger with Peoples Energy and also issued 2.7 million shares of common stock in May 2006 when it elected to settle its forward equity agreement with an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. Additional shares were also issued under the Integrys Energy Group, Inc. Stock Investment Plan and certain stock-based employee benefit plans.
 
EARNINGS FORECAST
 
Integrys Energy Groupcontinues to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its utility and nonregulated operations, while maintaining an emphasis on regulated growth. The companys emphasis on regulated growth has been demonstrated by the merger with Peoples Energy Corporation, ongoing expansion of its generation fleet, as well as the acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota during 2006. In all of the companys business units, financial tools commonly used in the industry are utilized to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and customers. Also, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions. The companys long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target remains at 6% to 8% on an average annualized basis, with fluctuations in any given year that may be above or below that target range.
The company anticipates generating earnings per diluted share in 2007 in the range of $3.35 and $3.55 diluted earnings per share, which includes discontinued operations. This guidance assumes normal weather conditions for the remainder of 2007, the availability of generation units, the merger impacts relating to transition costs and purchase accounting adjustments, and the completion of asset management sales. It also includes about $0.57 per diluted share contribution from Peoples Energy Production Company, which will be reflected in discontinued operations. This contribution could be less if the divestiture were to take place prior to the end of 2007. Additionally, the diluted earnings per share guidance does not include the impact of mark-to-market activity, except for certain mark-to-market activity related to business originating prior to 2007, which will be completed in 2007.
The projected guidance range for 2007 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted is anticipated to be between $2.66 and $2.85. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted guidance provides investors with additional insight into our operating performance
and
the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please see the attached Diluted Earnings per Share Information - Non GAAP

Financial Information (page 2) for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations - adjusted.
The companys 2008 guidance is between $3.67 and $3.94 diluted earnings per share, assuming normal weather conditions, the availability of generation units, the impacts of merger transition costs, the impacts of purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger, and the completion of asset management sales. The diluted earnings per share guidance assumes that Peoples Energy Production Company is divested by the end of 2007. Additionally, the diluted earnings per share guidance does not include the impact of mark-to-market activity, except for certain mark-to-market activity related to business originating prior to 2008, which will be completed in 2008.
