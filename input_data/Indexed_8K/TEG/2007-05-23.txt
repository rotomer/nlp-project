On May 17, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Integrys Energy Group, Inc. approved the Integrys Energy Group 2007 Executive Incentive Plan and its incentive award targets for 2007 for the executive officers of Integrys Energy Group and certain of its subsidiaries. Cash payouts may be earned on the basis of meeting net income and various other operational performance goals related to system reliability, safety, customer value, customer rates and diversity. The threshold, target and maximum annual cash bonus that may be earned in 2007 for the Integrys Energy Group Chief Executive Officer is 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of base salary. The threshold, target and maximum annual cash bonus that may be earned in 2007 for the other executive officers of Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries ranges from 10-32.5%, 20-65% and 40-195%, respectively, of base salary. In addition, the amount of these payments may be further modified for certain executive officers (increased or decreased by up to 50%) based on progress on four key corporate initiatives: 1) synergy savings related to the merger of Peoples Energy Corporation into a subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group, with Peoples Energy becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integrys Energy Group, 2) the start up of the Integrys Business Support subsidiary, 3) the pending rate applications for Peoples Energys utility subsidiaries in Illinois, and 4) the divestiture of Peoples Energy Production Company.
