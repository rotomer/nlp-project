YEAR-END RESULTS
Integrys Energy Group recognized income available for common shareholders of $251.3 million ($3.50 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with income available for common shareholders of $155.8 million ($3.67 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2006.
EARNINGS FORECAST
Integrys Energy Group continues to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its utility and nonregulated operations, while maintaining an emphasis on regulated growth.  The companys emphasis on regulated growth has been demonstrated by the Peoples Energy merger in 2007, ongoing expansion of its generation fleet, and the acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota during 2006.  The company utilizes financial tools commonly used in the industry to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and customers.  Also, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions.  The companys long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target remains at 6% to 8% on an average annualized basis, with fluctuations in any given year that may be above or below that target range.
The company anticipates generating earnings per diluted share in 2008 in the range of $3.33 to $3.78.  This guidance assumes normal weather conditions for 2008, the availability of generation units, the anticipated merger impacts relating to transition costs and anticipated purchase accounting adjustments, and anticipated synergy savings.  The diluted earnings per share guidance does not include the impact of mark-to-market activity on derivative instruments.
The projected guidance range for 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted is anticipated to be between $3.60 and $4.05.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted guidance provides investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations - adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS from continuing operations - adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
