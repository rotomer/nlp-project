On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.  Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (Integrys) and its subsidiaries, including Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPSC) and North Shore Gas Company (NSG), have energy transactions with subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers (together with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. individually and collectively referred to as Lehman).  Integrys, WPSC and NSG believe the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy will not have a material adverse effect on Integrys, WPSC or NSG, either individually or collectively.
If Integrys is unable to net certain transactions its subsidiaries have entered into with Lehman, Integrys believes its total exposure is approximately $8.0 million, pre-tax, or about $.06 in diluted earnings per share.   Netting of certain transactions would reduce this number.
Integrys current $1.98 billion of credit facilities (which includes WPSCs and its other subsidiaries credit facilities) include 27 financial institutions, but none of these facilities include Lehman Brothers or any of its subsidiaries.
