EARNINGS FORECAST
Integrys Energy Group continues to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its utility and nonregulated operations, while maintaining an emphasis on regulated growth.  The companys emphasis on regulated growth has been demonstrated by the Peoples Energy merger in 2007, ongoing expansion of its utility generation fleet, and the acquisition of retail natural gas distribution operations in Michigan and Minnesota during 2006.  The company utilizes financial tools commonly used in the industry to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and customers.  Also, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions.  The companys long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target remains at 6% to 8% on an average annualized basis.  This growth rate target will be evaluated as Integrys Energy Group re-evaluates long-term market conditions.
The company anticipates generating earnings per diluted share in 2008 within the range of $3.11 to $3.22.  For the remainder of 2008, this guidance assumes normal weather conditions, the availability of generation units, the anticipated merger impacts relating to transition costs and anticipated purchase accounting adjustments, anticipated merger synergy savings, and recently obtained rate relief for certain utilities.  The diluted earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of negative non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and derivative mark-to-market volatility for all of 2008 (such mark-to-market volatility is expected to include about $20 million of mark-to-market after-tax losses for all of 2008 relating to contracts terminating in 2008 which had net mark-to-market after-tax gains recognized in 2007).
The projected guidance range for 2008 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted is anticipated to be between $3.33 and $3.44.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted guidance provides investors with additional insight into the company's operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please see the Diluted Earnings per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information included at the end of this press release and also included with the supplemental data package on the company's Web site (to be available at approximately

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations  adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS from continuing operations  adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
