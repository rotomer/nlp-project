YEAR-END RESULTS
Integrys Energy Group recognized income available for common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $126.4 million ($1.64 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with income available for common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $251.3 million ($3.50 diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2007.  It is important to note

that the financial results of PEC and its subsidiaries were only included in 2007 income available for common shareholders from February 22, 2007 through December 31, 2007, the period following the merger.
Included in income available for common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $73.3 million of after-tax income related to discontinued operations (due primarily to earnings pertaining to a partial year of operation of Integrys Energy Group's oil and natural gas business in addition to a gain recorded on the sale of this business in 2007).  After-tax income from discontinued operations was $4.7 million in 2008.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, income available for common shareholders also included net after-tax non-cash accounting losses of $90.9 million, compared with net after-tax non-cash accounting gains of $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  This negative $133.6 million after-tax year-over-year change in non-cash activity was related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.  Integrys Energy Services expects to recover non-cash accounting losses related to derivative fair value adjustments and inventory valuation adjustments when the related electric and natural gas transactions are physically settled.
INTEGRYS ENERGY GROUP'S STRATEGY TO FULLY OR PARTIALLY DIVEST AND/OR SCALE BACK ITS NONREGULATED ENERGY SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT
Integrys Energy Group has made a decision to either divest entirely or partially its nonregulated energy services business segment, Integrys Energy Services, or significantly reduce the scope and scale of this business.  Integrys Energy Group's short-term strategy will be to reduce and refocus its capital on those aspects of Integrys Energy Services' business that yield the highest return.  Longer-term, in the event that a full divestiture of Integrys Energy Services does not occur and a portion of the nonregulated energy services business remains, it will be a smaller segment that requires significantly less capital, parental guaranties and overall financial liquidity support from Integrys Energy Group.   Execution of this strategic decision is expected to result in lower earnings contributions from Integrys Energy Services going forward.  In return, Integrys Energy Group expects an improved business risk profile and enhanced financial security.  Divestiture of the nonregulated business segment, or a reduction in its size and scope, is also expected to allow Integrys Energy Group to eliminate or reduce the credit facilities and other forms of financial support committed to Integrys Energy Services.  More details regarding this strategy change will be provided during Integrys Energy Groups earnings conference call scheduled for Thursday, February 26, 2009, at 8 a.m. CST.
EARNINGS FORECAST
Integrys Energy Group continues to manage its portfolio of businesses to achieve long-term growth in its core utility operations, while divesting and/or scaling back the nonregulated business segment.  The company utilizes financial tools commonly used in the industry to help mitigate risk for the benefit of both shareholders and customers.  In addition, the companys asset management strategy continues to deliver shareholder return from certain asset transactions.  Given the current economic environment, turmoil in the global financial markets, and the decision to reduce the size and scope of its nonregulated business segment, the company has reduced its

long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate target to 4 to 6 percent, on an average annualized basis, with 2009 as its base year, excluding non-cash derivative accounting and inventory valuation adjustment gains and losses.
The company anticipates generating earnings per diluted share in 2009 within the range of $2.51 to $2.66.  This guidance assumes normal weather conditions, the availability of generation units, and reasonable rate relief for certain utilities.  The diluted earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of non-cash lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments and derivative accounting mark-to-market volatility for all of 2009 (such mark-to-market volatility is expected to include about $29.6 million of non-cash after-tax gains for all of 2009 relating to contracts terminating in 2009 which had net non-cash after-tax losses recognized in 2008).
The projected guidance range for 2009 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted is anticipated to be between $2.53 and $2.68.  Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted guidance provides investors with additional insight into the company's operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please see the Diluted Earnings per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information included at the end of this news release and also included with the supplemental data package on the company's Web site (to be available at approximately 6:00 a.m. CDT on February 26, 2009) for a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations  adjusted.
Integrys Energy Groups management will provide earnings guidance by its four main business segments during its earnings conference call at 8 a.m. CST on February 26.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations  adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS from continuing operations 
adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
