Exhibit 3.1
 
1.           General Powers
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors.  The Board shall determine the nature and character of the business to be conducted by the Corporation and the method of doing so; what employees, agents, and officers shall be employed and their compensation; and what purchases or contracts for purchase shall be made.  The Board may delegate any of its aforesaid powers to committees or to officers, agents, or employees as it may from time to time determine.  The Board of Directors may elect from among the directors a Chairman of the Board.  Such Chairman may be designated an Executive Chairman or a Non-Executive Chairman (hereinafter to be referred to individually or collectively as the Chairman).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chairman shall only be designated as an Executive Chairman if such Chairman is a current or former executive officer of the Corporation.  The Chairman shall have such authority as is described in these By-laws or as the Board may from time to time prescribe.
 
2.
   
Number of Directors
The number of directors of the Corporation shall be 15. Until the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, the directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class A, Class B, and Class C, and each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  From and after the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors shall be members of only a single class.
3.           Term
Commencing with the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders, directors shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualified, except that any director at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders whose term expires at the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders or the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected and until such directors successor is duly elected and qualified.  From and after the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors will stand for election annually.
4.           Qualifications
No director shall be eligible for election after attaining the age of years.  Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Wisconsin.

5.           Meetings
The Board of Directors shall hold its meetings at such place or places, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the Board may from time to time determine.
 
 
6.           Notice; Waiver
Notice of each special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by written notice delivered or communicated in person, by telegraph, teletype, facsimile or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by mail or private carrier, to each director at his or her business address or at such other address as such director shall have designated in writing filed with the Secretary, in each case not less than 48 hours prior to the meeting.  The notice need not prescribe the purpose of the special meeting of the Board of Directors or the business to be transacted at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.  If notice is given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company.  If notice is given by private carrier, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when delivered to the private carrier.  Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any director of the Corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws or any provision of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the date and time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.  The Corporation shall retain any such waiver as part of the permanent corporate records.  A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
7.           Quorum
Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, a majority of the number of directors specified in Section 2 of Article III of these By-laws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors.  Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws, a quorum of any committee of the Board of Directors created pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall consist of a majority of the number of directors appointed to serve on the committee.  A majority of the directors present (though less than such quorum) may adjourn any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, from time to time without further notice.
8.           Manner of Acting
The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, unless the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws require the vote of a greater number of directors.
9.           Minutes of Meetings
Minutes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be prepared and distributed to each director.
10.         Vacancies
Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled in the manner provided in Article 5 of the Articles of Incorporation.
 
11.         Compensation
The Board of Directors, irrespective of any personal interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable compensation of all directors for services to the Corporation as directors, officers, or otherwise, or may delegate such authority to an appropriate committee.  The Board of Directors also shall have authority to provide for or delegate authority to an appropriate committee to provide for reasonable pensions, disability or death benefits, and other benefits or payments, to directors, officers, and employees and to their estates, families, dependents, or beneficiaries on account of prior services rendered by such directors, officers, and employees to the Corporation.
12.         Presumption of Assent
A director who is present and is announced as present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof created in accordance with Section 13 of this Article III, when corporate action is taken, assents to the action taken unless any of the following occurs:
Such right of dissent or abstention shall not apply to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.
13.        Committees
The Board of Directors by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors then in office may create one or more committees, appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on the committees and designate other members of the Board of Directors to serve as alternates.  Each committee shall have at least one member who shall, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  A committee may be authorized to exercise the authority of the Board of Directors, except that a committee may not do any of the following:  (a) approve or recommend to shareholders for approval any action or matter expressly required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes, to be submitted to shareholders for approval; and (b) adopt, amend or repeal any By-Law of the Corporation.  Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating the committee, a committee may employ counsel, accountants and other consultants to assist it in the exercise of its authority.
14.
   
Telephonic Meetings
Except as herein provided and notwithstanding any place set forth in the notice of the meeting or these By-laws, members of the Board of Directors (and any committees thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this Article III) may participate in regular or special meetings by, or through the use of, any means of communication by which all participants may simultaneously hear each other, such as by conference telephone.  If a meeting is conducted by such means, then at the commencement of such meeting the presiding officer shall inform the participating directors that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted.  Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action may be taken at any meeting held by such means on any particular matter which the presiding officer determines, in his or her sole discretion, to be inappropriate under the
 
 
circumstances for action at a meeting held by such means.  Such determination shall be made and announced in advance of such meeting.
15.         Action without Meeting
Any action required or permitted by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this Article III may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board or of the committee.  The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each director or committee member, and retained by the Corporation.  Such action shall be effective when the last director or committee member signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.
16.         Conduct of Meeting
If a Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be elected, he or she shall preside as Chairman of all meetings of the shareholders and of the Board of Directors.  If there is no Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman, the presiding officer at meetings of the shareholders, and of the Board of Directors shall be the Lead Director, if any, or in the absence of the Lead Director, if any, another officer in the following order of priority: Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice Presidents (subject, however, to Section 5 of Article IV).
 
 
 

1.           Principal Office
The principal office of the Corporation in the State of Wisconsin shall be in the City of Green Bay.  The Corporation may also have offices at such other places, within and outside of the State of Wisconsin, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of the Corporation may require.
2.           Registered Office
The Board of Directors shall designate the registered office of the Corporation and may change such registered office by resolution.
The annual meeting of the shareholders ("Annual Meeting") shall be held each year at such time and on such day as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors.  In fixing a meeting date for any Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of its business judgment.
At each Annual Meeting, the shareholders shall elect the number of directors equal to the number of directors in the class whose term expires at the time of such Annual Meeting and transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting in accordance with Section 14 of Article II of these By-laws.  If the election of directors shall not be held on the date fixed as herein provided, for any Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of shareholders (a "Special Meeting") as soon thereafter as is practicable.

The Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary may designate any place, either within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the place of meeting for any Annual Meeting or for any Special Meeting or for any postponement or adjournment thereof.  If no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal business office of the Corporation in the State of Wisconsin.  Any meeting may be adjourned to reconvene at any place designated by vote of the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary.
 
 
Written or printed notice stating the date, time and place of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting shall be delivered not less than ten days (unless a longer period is required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation) nor more than 70 days before the date of such meeting either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting and to such other shareholders as required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law.  In the event of any Demand Special Meeting, such notice shall be sent not more than 45 days after the Delivery Date. If mailed, notice pursuant to this Section 5 shall be deemed to be effective when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock record books of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.  Unless otherwise required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation, a notice of an Annual Meeting need not include a description of the purpose for which the meeting is called.  In the case of any Special Meeting, (a) the notice of meeting shall describe any business that the Board of Directors shall have theretofore determined to bring before the meeting and (b) in the case of a Demand Special Meeting, the notice of meeting (i) shall describe any business set forth in the statement of purpose of the demands received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 3 of this Article II and (ii) shall contain all of the information required in the notice received by the Corporation in accordance with Section 14(b) of this Article II.  If an Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, the Corporation shall not be required to give notice of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; provided, however, that if a new Meeting Record Date for an adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, the Corporation shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to persons who are shareholders as of the new Meeting Record Date.

The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date not less than 10 days and not more than 70 days prior to the date of any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting (other than a Demand Special Meeting) as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, such meeting ("Meeting Record Date").  If a Meeting Record Date is not fixed by the Board of Directors or by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting (other than a Demand Special Meeting), the Meeting Record Date shall be the close of business on the day before the first notice is given to Shareholders.  In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i) the Meeting Record Date shall not be later than the 30 day after the Delivery Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30 day shall be the Meeting Record Date.  The shareholders of record on the Meeting Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting.  Except as provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a court-ordered adjournment, a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is effective for any adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting.  The Board of Directors may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for any other purpose.  Such record date shall be not more than 70 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken.  The record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Corporation's shares) or a share dividend is the date on which the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution or share dividend, as the case may be, unless the Board of Directors fixes a different record date.
th
th
 
 
After a Meeting Record Date has been fixed, the Corporation shall prepare a list of the names of all of the shareholders entitled to notice of the meeting.  The list shall be arranged by class or series of shares, if any, and show the address of, and number of shares held by, each shareholder.  Such list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, at the Corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.  A shareholder or his agent may, on written demand, inspect and, subject to the limitations imposed by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, copy the list, during regular business hours and at his or her expense, during the period that it is available for inspection pursuant to this Section 7.  The Corporation shall make the shareholders' list available at the meeting and any shareholder or his or her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders' list shall not affect the validity of any action taken at a meeting of shareholders.

The Chairman of the Board, and in his or her absence, the Chief Executive Officer, and in their absence, the Lead Director, and in their absence, the Chair of the Governance Committee in the order provided under Section 5 of Article IV of these By-laws, and in their absence, any person chosen by the shareholders present shall call any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting to order and shall act as chairman of such meeting, and the Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of all Annual Meetings and Special Meetings, but in the absence of the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as secretary of the meeting.
 
 
At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder entitled to vote may vote his or her or its shares in person or by proxy. A shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders may authorize another person to act for the shareholder by appointing the person as proxy.  Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may appoint a proxy, a shareholder or the shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee, agent or attorney-in-fact may use any of the following as a valid means to make such an appointment:
 
 
 
 
6
 
 
An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of elections or the officer or agent of the Corporation authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment is valid for 11 months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment.  Unless otherwise provided, a proxy may be revoked any time before it is voted, either by appointing a new proxy in accordance with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or by oral notice given by the shareholder to the presiding officer during the meeting.  The presence of a shareholder who has made an effective proxy appointment shall not itself constitute a revocation.  The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make rules establishing presumptions as to the validity and sufficiency of proxies.
 
 
 
 
If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of a shareholder.  If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of a shareholder, the Corporation, if acting in good faith, may accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if any of the following apply:
 
 
 
 
 
 
7
 
 
The Corporation may reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the Secretary or other officer or agent of the Corporation who is authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the shareholder.
 
 
A shareholder may waive any notice required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation or these By-laws before or after the date and time stated in the notice.  The waiver shall be in writing and signed by the shareholder entitled to the notice, contain the same information that would have been required in the notice under applicable provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (except that the time and place of meeting need not be stated) and be delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the corporate records.  A shareholder's attendance at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, waives objection to all of the following:  (a) lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the matter when it is presented.

1.           General Powers
The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors.  The Board shall determine the nature and character of the business to be conducted by the Corporation and the method of doing so; what employees, agents, and officers shall be employed and their compensation; and what purchases or contracts for purchase shall be made.  The Board may delegate any of its aforesaid powers to committees or to officers, agents, or employees as it may from time to time determine.  The Board of Directors may elect from among the directors a Chairman of the Board.  Such Chairman may be designated an Executive Chairman or a Non-Executive Chairman (hereinafter to be referred to individually or collectively as the Chairman).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chairman shall only be designated as an Executive Chairman if such Chairman is a current or former executive officer of the Corporation.  The Chairman shall have such authority as is described in these By-laws or as the Board may from time to time prescribe.
2.           Number of Directors
The number of directors of the Corporation shall be 15. Until the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, the directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class A, Class B, and Class C, and each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors.  From and after the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors shall be members of only a single class.
3.           Term
Commencing with the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders, directors shall be elected annually for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualified, except that any director at the 2009 annual meeting of shareholders whose term expires at the 2010 annual meeting of shareholders or the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders shall continue to hold office until the end of the term for which such director was elected and until such directors successor is duly elected and qualified.  From and after the 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, all directors will stand for election annually.
4.           Qualifications
No director shall be eligible for election after attaining the age of 72 years.  Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Wisconsin.

The Board of Directors shall hold its meetings at such place or places, within or without the State of Wisconsin, as the Board may from time to time determine.
 
11
 
6.           Notice; Waiver
Notice of each special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be given by written notice delivered or communicated in person, by telegraph, teletype, facsimile or other form of wire or wireless communication, or by mail or private carrier, to each director at his or her business address or at such other address as such director shall have designated in writing filed with the Secretary, in each case not less than 48 hours prior to the meeting.  The notice need not prescribe the purpose of the special meeting of the Board of Directors or the business to be transacted at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.  If notice is given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company.  If notice is given by private carrier, such notice shall be deemed to be effective when delivered to the private carrier.  Whenever any notice whatever is required to be given to any director of the Corporation under the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws or any provision of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time, whether before or after the date and time of meeting, by the director entitled to such notice shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.  The Corporation shall retain any such waiver as part of the permanent corporate records.  A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to him or her of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting or promptly upon his or her arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
7.           Quorum
Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law or by the Articles of Incorporation or these By-laws, a majority of the number of directors specified in Section 2 of Article III of these By-laws shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors.  Except as otherwise provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws, a quorum of any committee of the Board of Directors created pursuant to Section 13 hereof shall consist of a majority of the number of directors appointed to serve on the committee.  A majority of the directors present (though less than such quorum) may adjourn any meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, as the case may be, from time to time without further notice.
8.           Manner of Acting
The affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, unless the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these By-laws require the vote of a greater number of directors.
9.           Minutes of Meetings
Minutes of any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be prepared and distributed to each director.
 
12
 
10.         Vacancies
Vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors shall be filled in the manner provided in Article 5 of the Articles of Incorporation.
11.         Compensation
The Board of Directors, irrespective of any personal interest of any of its members, may establish reasonable compensation of all directors for services to the Corporation as directors, officers, or otherwise, or may delegate such authority to an appropriate committee.  The Board of Directors also shall have authority to provide for or delegate authority to an appropriate committee to provide for reasonable pensions, disability or death benefits, and other benefits or payments, to directors, officers, and employees and to their estates, families, dependents, or beneficiaries on account of prior services rendered by such directors, officers, and employees to the Corporation.
12.         Presumption of Assent
A director who is present and is announced as present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof created in accordance with Section 13 of this Article III, when corporate action is taken, assents to the action taken unless any of the following occurs:
Such right of dissent or abstention shall not apply to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.
13.         Committees
The Board of Directors by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors then in office may create one or more committees, appoint members of the Board of Directors to serve on the committees and designate other members of the Board of Directors to serve as alternates.  Each committee shall have at least one member who shall, unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors, serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  A committee may be authorized to exercise the authority of the Board of Directors, except that a committee may not do any of the following:  (a) approve or recommend to shareholders for approval any action or matter expressly required by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, Chapter 180 of the Wisconsin Statutes, to be submitted to shareholders for approval; and (b) adopt, amend or repeal any By-Law of the Corporation.  Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in creating the committee, a committee may employ counsel, accountants and other consultants to assist it in the exercise of its authority.
Except as herein provided and notwithstanding any place set forth in the notice of the meeting or these By-laws, members of the Board of Directors (and any committees thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this Article III) may participate in regular or special meetings by, or through the
 
13
 
use of, any means of communication by which all participants may simultaneously hear each other, such as by conference telephone.  If a meeting is conducted by such means, then at the commencement of such meeting the presiding officer shall inform the participating directors that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted.  Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no action may be taken at any meeting held by such means on any particular matter which the presiding officer determines, in his or her sole discretion, to be inappropriate under the circumstances for action at a meeting held by such means.  Such determination shall be made and announced in advance of such meeting.
15.        Action without Meeting
Any action required or permitted by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof created pursuant to Section 13 of this Article III may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board or of the committee.  The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each director or committee member, and retained by the Corporation.  Such action shall be effective when the last director or committee member signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.
16.        Conduct of Meeting
If a Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be elected, he or she shall preside as Chairman of all meetings of the shareholders and of the Board of Directors.  If there is no Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the Chairman, the presiding officer at meetings of the shareholders, and of the Board of Directors shall be the Lead Director, if any, or in the absence of the Lead Director, if any, another officer in the following order of priority: Chief Executive Officer, President and Vice Presidents (subject, however, to Section 5 of Article IV).
1.           Principal Officers
The principal officers of the Corporation required by statute shall be a President, such number of Vice Presidents as may be elected by the Board of Directors, a Secretary, and a Treasurer.  The Board of Directors may elect from among the directors an Executive Chairman of the Board, may elect any principal officer as the Chief Executive Officer and may elect such assistant secretaries and assistant treasurers and other officers as it shall deem necessary, and may prescribe by resolution their respective powers and duties.
2.           Executive Chairman of the Board
If elected pursuant to Section 1 of this Article IV and Section 1 of Article III of these By-laws, the Executive Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the shareholders and directors at which he or she is present.  The Executive Chairman of the Board shall possess the same powers and authority as the Chief Executive Officer possesses pursuant to Sections 4(b) and (c) of this Article IV.  He or she shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as are incident to the office of Executive Chairman of the Board and as may be prescribed by the Board.  The Executive Chairman may use the title Executive Chairman, Executive Chairman of the Board, Chairman or Chairman of the Board interchangeably.
 
14
 
3.           President
The President shall be elected by the directors.  Unless the Board of Directors otherwise prescribes, he or she shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.  In the event that the President is not the Chief Executive Officer, he or she shall have such powers and duties as the Board of Directors may prescribe.

Whenever any certificate is manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent, or a registrar, other than the Corporation itself or an employee of the Corporation, the signatures of the Executive Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, Vice President, Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, upon such certificate may be facsimiles.  In case any officer who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon such certificate, ceases to be such officer before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as if he or she were such officer at the date of its issue.

5.           Transfer of Shares
Prior to due presentment of shares for registration of transfer the Corporation may treat the registered owner of such shares as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications, and otherwise to have and exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.  Where shares are presented to the Corporation with a request to register for transfer, the Corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any other person suffering loss as a result of such registration of transfer if:
The Corporation may require reasonable assurance that said endorsements or transfer instructions are genuine and effective and compliance with such other regulations as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.
6.           Consideration for Shares
The Board of Directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the Corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed or other securities of the Corporation.  Before the Corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall determine that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be issued is adequate.  The determination of the Board of Directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable.  The Corporation may place in escrow shares issued in whole or in part for a contract for future services or benefits, a promissory note, or otherwise for property to be issued in the future, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the benefits or property are received, or the promissory note is paid.  If the services are not performed, the benefits or property are not received, or the promissory note is not paid, the Corporation may cancel, in whole or in part, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited.
7.           Other Rules
The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority to make all such further rules and regulations not inconsistent with the statutes of the State of Wisconsin as it may deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer, and registration of shares of the Corporation, including the appointment and designation of Transfer Agents and Registrars.
