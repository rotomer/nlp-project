(Integrys Energy Group, Inc. News Release Letterhead)
 
For Immediate Release
November 4, 2009
 
Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis of $51.1 million ($0.66 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $59.1 million ($0.77 net loss per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
Chicago  November 4, 2009 
Third quarter 2009 net income attributed to common shareholders of $51.1 million included $26.1 million of certain after-tax items, consisting of $27.6 million of after-tax non-cash gains related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services, Inc., partially offset by $1.5 million of after-tax expenses related to restructuring activities at Integrys Energy Services.  The third quarter 2008 net loss attributed to common shareholders of $59.1 million included $79.6 million of after-tax non-cash losses related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.  Exclusive of these certain after-tax items recognized in the third quarters of 2009 and 2008, Integrys Energy Groups earnings would have increased quarter-over-quarter to net income attributed to common shareholders of $25.0 million ($0.33 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, from net income attributed to common shareholders of $20.5 million ($0.27 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
Year-to-date results for our core utilities have improved year-over-year, with the impact of our recent rate cases and cost control measures enabling us to overcome a third quarter that was hampered by a difficult economic environment and unfavorable weather conditions.  Our cost control measures will carry through in the fourth quarter, which is part of the reason we are able to increase our earnings guidance for full-year 2009, said Charles Schrock, President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group.  We are continuing to execute our process to significantly reduce the capital and collateral support requirements for Integrys Energy Services, as evidenced by the transactions we have announced since July of this year.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
