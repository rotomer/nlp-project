Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis of $23.5 million ($0.31 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $25.6 million ($0.33 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
Chicago  February 25, 2010 
Fourth quarter 2009 net income attributed to common shareholders of $23.5 million included $16.1 million of certain after-tax items, consisting of $16.8 million of net after-tax losses, primarily driven by timing differences caused by the accounting treatment for derivative and non-derivative contracts related to the sale of the wholesale natural gas marketing business in conjunction with Integrys Energy Services Inc.s strategy change, and $13.8 million of after-tax restructuring expense related to both the Integrys Energy Services strategy change and reductions in the workforce implemented at Integrys Energy Group, partially offset by $14.5 million of net after-tax non-cash gains related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.  Fourth quarter 2008 net income attributed to common shareholders of $25.6 million included $41.9 million of net after-tax non-cash losses related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.  Exclusive of these certain after-tax items recognized in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008, Integrys Energy Groups earnings would have decreased $27.9 million quarter-over-quarter, from net income attributed to common shareholders of $67.5 million ($0.88 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, to net income attributed to common shareholders of $39.6 million ($0.51 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
We view 2009 as a successful year in a number of ways, said Charles A. Schrock, President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group.  First, our 2009 full-year financial results exceeded our expectations.  Second, we completed five rate cases, an important achievement that, when combined with our focus on operational excellence and continued cost control measures, will help our regulated utilities move closer toward their authorized returns on equity in the future.  Finally, we achieved our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services, and our restructured nonregulated energy services business is positioned for controlled growth with a recurring customer-based business, reduced size, and lower risk profile.  We are confident that Integrys Energy Group is well-positioned for the future.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
