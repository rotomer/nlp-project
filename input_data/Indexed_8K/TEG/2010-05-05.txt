Exhibit 99.1
(Integrys Energy Group, Inc. News Release)
For Immediate Release
May 5, 2010
 
 
 
Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis of $49.5 million ($0.64 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $180.2 million ($2.35 net loss per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Chicago  May 5, 2010 
Excluding the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, Integrys Energy Groups diluted earnings per share would have decreased $0.07, from diluted earnings per share  adjusted of $1.56 for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, to diluted earnings per share  adjusted of $1.49 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.  Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information included at the end of this news release and also included with the supplemental data package on Integrys Energy Groups Web site for a reconciliation between diluted earnings per share computed on a GAAP basis and diluted earnings per share  adjusted.
We made great strides on executing our business plan in the first quarter of 2010.  We continued our operational excellence initiatives, received rate increases for our Illinois natural gas regulated utilities, filed an electric and natural gas rate case for Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and completed the sale of our nonregulated wholesale electric marketing business, said Charles A. Schrock, Chairman, President and CEO of Integrys Energy Group, Inc.  These efforts will help support achieving our financial expectations for 2010 and 2011.

EARNINGS FORECAST
The projected guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be between $2.94 and $3.22.  We have reduced our 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance downward by $0.15 per diluted share as compared with what we provided on February 26, 2010 to reflect the impact of the recently passed health care reform bill.  In 2011, the projected guidance range for diluted earnings per share is reaffirmed at $3.28 to $3.61.  This guidance assumes operational improvements and rate relief for certain utilities, the availability of generation units, and normal weather conditions subsequent to March 31, 2010.  This guidance does not include any additional Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs, subsequent to March 31, 2010, related to reductions in the workforce that are currently in progress (other than those at Integrys Energy Services).  Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Guidance Information included at the end of this news release and also included with the supplemental data package on the company's Web site for more detailed information on earnings guidance.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted, which is a non-GAAP measure.  Management uses the measure in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose this measure in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted is a useful measure for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Therefore, this measure allows investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
