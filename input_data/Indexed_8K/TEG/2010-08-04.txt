Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis of $78.9 million ($1.01 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared with net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $34.7 million ($0.45 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Chicago  August 4, 2010 
Excluding the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, Integrys Energy Group recognized adjusted earnings of $36.4 million ($0.47 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared with adjusted earnings of $20.3 million ($0.26 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.  Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information and the Non-GAAP Financial Information Reported by Segment, both of which are included at the end of this news release and are also included with the supplemental data package on Integrys Energy Groups Web site.  These documents provide a reconciliation between diluted earnings (loss) per share computed on a GAAP basi s and diluted earnings (loss) per share  adjusted, and a reconciliation by reportable segment between net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders and adjusted earnings (loss) and also between diluted earnings (loss) per share on a GAAP basis and diluted earnings (loss) per share  adjusted.
We continued to successfully implement our strategy in the second quarter, as demonstrated by higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings at each of our reportable segments, said Charles A. Schrock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group.  Tight cost controls and operational improvements balanced the negative impact of weather and the economy for our regulated utilities portfolio, and Integrys Energy Services transition to its revised business plan of controlled growth is moving forward according to plan.

shareholders for the six months ended June 30, 2009, of $145.5 million included $285.9 million of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, consisting of a $248.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment loss related to the natural gas utility segment, $25.2 million of non-cash losses related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services, and $11.9 million of restructuring charges.  Exclusive of these certain items recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, Integrys Energy Groups earnings on an adjusted basis would have increased period-over-period to adjusted earnings of $151.8 million ($1.96 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the six months ended June 30, 2010, from adjusted earnings of $140.4 million ($1.83 dilute d earnings per share  adjusted) for the six months ended June 30, 2009.
EARNINGS FORECAST
Our guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis is between $2.80 and $3.08.  Our guidance range for 2011 diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis is between $3.28 and $3.61.  This guidance assumes operational improvements and rate relief for certain utilities, the availability of generation units, and normal weather conditions subsequent to June 30, 2010.  This guidance does not include any additional Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs, subsequent to June 30, 2010, related to reductions in the workforce that are currently in progress and nearly complete (other than those at Integrys Energy Services).  Diluted earnings per share guidance is adjusted for certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Our guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share  adjusted is between $2.89 and $3.17.  Our guidance range for 2011 diluted earnings per share  adjusted is between $3.24 and $3.57.  Making similar adjustments to the 2010 and 2011 GAAP earnings per share guidance that was issued on May 6, 2010, would have resulted in Integrys Energy Group consolidated diluted earnings per share  adjusted guidance for 2010 and 2011 that is equal to the adjusted guidance issued today.  Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Guidance Information included at the end of this news release and also included with the supplemental data package on the company's Web site for more detailed information on earnings guidance.
Integrys Energy Group expects a long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis, using 2011 as the base year, through 2015.
Integrys Energy Groups management will discuss earnings guidance for 2010 and 2011, during its earnings conference call at 8 a.m. CDT on Thursday, August 5.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss), which are non-GAAP measures.  Management uses these measures in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose these measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss) are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparab le from one period to the next.  Therefore, these measures allow investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
