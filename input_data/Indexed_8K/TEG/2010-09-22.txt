Participant Accounts
 
A record keeping Account will be maintained to record the interest of each Participant under the Plan.  An Account is established for record keeping purposes only and not to reflect the physical segregation of assets on the Participants behalf.  A Participants Account will consist of separate balances to record a Participants interest in each of the Investment Options, and to record the portion of a Participants overall Account that is attributable to deferrals and contribution credits made and vested prior to January 1, 2005, together with any earnings or loss thereon through the date of distribution from the Plan (the Pre-2005 Account), and the portion of the Participants overall Account that is attributable to deferrals and contribution credits made or vested after December 31 , 2004, together with any earnings or loss thereon through the date of distribution from the Plan (the Post-2004 Account).

Integrys Stock Units
 
(a)
 
.  For purposes of the Plan, the term Locked Stock Units refers to the portion of a Participants Account that has been credited to the Plan in the form of Integrys Stock Units with respect to which the Participant is not able to exercise investment discretion or otherwise cause such amounts to be transferred to an alternate Investment Option.  The term Discretionary Stock Units refers to the portion of a Participants Account that, at any point in time, is deemed to be invested in Integrys Stock Units, but the Participant is permitted, in accordance with the rules of the Plan, to exercise i nvestment discretion with respect to such amounts or to cause such amounts to be transferred to an alternate Investment Option.  The Locked Stock Units are described in subsection (b) below.  The Discretionary Stock Units are all Stock Units credited to the Participants Account, other than the Locked Stock Units.
Locked and Discretionary Stock Units
 
(b)
 
.  The following are Locked Stock Units, meaning that the Participant is not able to exercise investment discretion, either with respect to the Stock Units that may be credited to the Participants Account from these sources, or with respect to any additional Stock Units that are credited as a result of the deemed payment of dividends or other distributions on such Stock Units:

.  Any dividends (or similar distribution) that would have been payable on the Stock Units credited to a Participants Stock Unit Account had such Stock Units been actual shares of Integrys Stock, if not already expressed in the form of shares of Integrys Stock or shares in another entity, shall be converted, for record keeping purposes, into whole and fractional Stock Units, with fractional units calculated to four decimal places.  The conversion shall be accomplished by dividing the amount of the dividend or distribution by the closing price of a share of Integrys Stock on the payment date for the dividend or distribution.
Crediting of Additional Stock Units For Deemed Dividends and Similar Distributions
 
(e)
 
.  If a Participant elects under Section 6.01(d) to transfer all or any portion of his or her Discretionary Stock Units to an alternate Investment Option, the Stock Units to which such election relates shall be converted, for record keeping purposes, from Stock Units into an amount that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of such Stock Units that are being transferred by the closing price of a share of Integrys Stock, on the effective date of such investment transfer, as reported in the Wall Street Journals New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction listing.
Conversion from Stock Units to Another Investment Option
 
(f)
 
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all transfer elections under Section 6.01(d) by a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act  are subject to review by the Committee prior to implementation.  Further, the following transfer transactions under Section 6.01(d) by a Participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are prohibited: (i) elections to transfer the deemed investment of the affected Participants Account into Stock Units within six (6) months of an election to reallocate deemed investments out of Stock Units; and (ii) elections to transfer the deemed investment of the affected Participants Account out of Stock Units within six (6) months of an election to reallocate deemed investments into Stock Units (collectively, Prohibited Transactions).  All Prohibited Transactions are void.  In accordance with Section 11.02, the Committee may restrict additional transactions, or impose other rules and procedures, to the extent deemed desirable by the Committee in order to comply with the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, application of the review and approval provisions of this Section 5.04(f) to Participants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

Special Rules Applicable to Restricted Stock or Stock Unit Deferrals
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Participants interest in Stock Units attributable to a deferral of an Omnibus Plan restricted stock or restricted stock unit award shall be subject to the same vesting or forfeiture conditions to which the Participant would have been subject if the Participant had received the restricted stock directly rather than electing to defer delivery of such shares.  Similarly, except with respect to dividend (or other distribution) credits that the Committee has determined are at all times fully vested and therefore are to be credited to a special Restricted Stock Dividend Account, the dividend (or distribution) credit shall be credited to the Participant in the form of additional Stock Units, in accordance with
 
 
21
 
 
Section 5.04(d), and such additional Stock Units shall be subject to the same vesting or forfeiture conditions as apply with respect to the underlying Integrys Stock Units on which the dividend (or distribution) credit is based.

23
 
 
 
(b)
 
.  Restricted stock deferrals are credited to the Plan in the form of Locked Stock Units until vested, at which time such Stock Units will become Discretionary Stock Units.  The Participant is not permitted to make an investment election with respect to Locked Stock Units or to cause Locked Stock Units to be transferred to an alternate Investment Option.  A Participant may transfer Discretionary Stock Units to an alternate Investment Option in accordance with Section 6.01(d).
Deemed Investment of Restricted Stock Deferrals
 
(c)
 
.  On each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, or at such other times as the Committee may prescribe (the Valuation Date), the Account of each Participant will be credited (or charged) based upon the investment gain (or loss) that the Participant would have realized with respect to his or her Account since the immediately preceding Valuation Date had the Account been invested in accordance with the terms of the Plan and where applicable, the Participants election.  Subject to the special rules set forth in Article V with respect to Reserve Account A, Reserve Account B, and Integr ys Stock Units, the credit (or charge) shall be the sum, separately calculated for each of the Investment Options, of the product obtained by multiplying (i) the portion (if any) of the Participants Account as of the immediately prior Valuation Date that is deemed to have been invested in each Investment Option, and (ii) the rate of return experienced by that Investment Option since the immediately preceding Valuation Date.  The Committee, in its discretion, may prescribe alternate rules for the valuation of Participant Accounts, including, without limitation, the application of unit accounting principles.
Allocation of Deemed Investment Gain or Loss
 
(d)
 
. Subject to such restrictions as may be in effect or implemented pursuant to Section 5.04(f), and in accordance with rules prescribed by the Committee (which may include limitations on the timing or frequency of reallocation transactions initiated by some or all Participants), each Participant may elect to reallocate his or her Account (other than Locked Stock Units) among the available Investment Options; provided that no amounts may be allocated to Reserve Account A or Reserve Account B.  When selecting more than one Investment Option, the Participant shall designate, in whole multiples of 1% or such other percentage determined by the Committee, the percentage of his or her available
Reallocation of Account

Account that is deemed to be invested in each available Investment Option after the investment reallocation is given effect.  Once effective, a Participants reallocation shall remain in effect unless and until modified by a subsequent election that becomes effective in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Committee.  Other than a reallocation of a Participants Account pursuant to a revised investment election submitted by the Participant, the deemed investment allocation of a Participant will not be adjusted to reflect differences in the relative investment return realized by the various hypothetical Investment Options that the Participant has designated.
 
Section 6.02.    
.
Accounts are For Record Keeping Purposes Only
 
Plan Accounts and the record keeping procedures described herein serve solely as a device for determining the amount of benefits accumulated by a Participant under the Plan, and shall not constitute or imply an obligation on the part of a Participating Employer to fund such benefits.   Each Participating Employer shall record on its books the amount of deferrals of compensation made hereunder (as adjusted for gains and losses thereon) by a Participant that are attributable to the services performed by such Participant for such Participating Employer and the Participating Employer shall be responsible for the payment thereof.  In any event, a Participating Employer may, in its discretion, set aside assets and/or contribute to the Trust assets equal to part or all of such account balances that are attributable to it and inve st such assets in Integrys Stock, life insurance or any other investment deemed appropriate.  Any such assets held by a Participating Employer or the Trust  shall be and remain the sole property of the Participating Employer or the Trust, as applicable, and except to the extent that the Trust authorizes a Participant to direct the trustee with respect to the voting of Integrys Stock held in the Trust, a Participant shall have no proprietary rights of any nature whatsoever with respect to such assets.

Modified Distribution Election
 
A Participant may from time to time modify his or her distribution election with respect to his or her Post-2004 Account by filing a revised distribution election, properly completed and signed, with the Committee.  However, except to the extent permitted under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code Section 409A, a revised distribution election must comply with the following rules:
 
(a)
 
The revised distribution election may not accelerate the time of payment in violation of Code Section 409A.  For example, a  revised distribution election may not elect a distribution commencement date earlier than the distribution commencement date applicable under the Participants prior distribution election.   A revised election that does not comply with these rules will be null and void, and will be disregarded by the Plan.
 
(b)
 
The revised distribution election may (i) change the form of payment from a single sum payment to installment distributions, (ii) from installment distributions to a single sum distribution, (iii) from one installment period to a different installment period, or (iv) defer the distribution commencement date, and such a revised election will be given effect 12 months after the date on which the election is made, but only if (i) the revised election is made at least 12 months prior to the date on which payment would be made or commence in the absence of the revised election, and (ii) in the case of any election other than one related to payment on account of Disability or death, the first payment that is made pursuant to the revised election is deferr ed for at least 5 years from the date payment would otherwise have been made.  For purposes of Code Section 409A, the installment payment option is considered to be a single form of payment rather than a series of independent payments.  A revised election that does not comply with these rules will be null and void, and will be disregarded by the Plan.

Calculation of Annual Distribution Amount

(a)
 
The annual distribution amount for the Participants Post-2004 Account, other than the portion of the Post-2004 Account that is deemed to be invested in Stock Units (the Distributable Account), shall be determined by dividing (A) the aggregate balance in the Distributable Account as of January 1 of the year for which the distribution is being made, by (B) the number of installment payments remaining to be made under the distribution period selected by the Participant.  Distributions shall be made in cash.  The amount of any distribution under this subsection (a) will be charged pro-rata against the Participants interest in each Investment Option comprising the Distributable Account.  Notwithst anding the foregoing, the last installment payment of the Distributable Account shall be adjusted to take into account deemed investment gains or losses for the period between the January 1 valuation date and the date of actual payment according to such methods and procedures adopted by the Committee.
 
(b)
 
The annual distribution amount for the portion of the Participants Post-2004 Account that is credited in the form of Stock Units shall be determined on a share basis by dividing (A) the number of Integrys Stock Units as of January 1 of the year for which the distribution is being made (subject to subsequent adjustment under Section 9.02), by (B) the number of installment payments remaining to be made under the distribution period selected by the Participant. The Participant will receive shares of Integrys Stock equal to the annual distribution amount, subject only to the distribution of cash in lieu of any fractional Integrys Stock Unit.  The cash payment for any fractional Integrys Stock Unit shall be determined based upon the closing price of a share of Integrys Stock on January 21 of the year in which the distribution is being made, as such share price is reported in the Wall Street Journals New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing.  If January 21 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the calculation of the cash portion of the distribution will be made based upon the closing price as reported for the immediately preceding business day.

Unless otherwise directed by the Committee, the single sum distribution shall be made in cash and/or shares of Integrys Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 8.03).  The foregoing rule shall apply only if (1) the payment results in the termination of liquidation of the Participants entire interest in his or her Post-2004 Account and his or her enti re interest in all other plans, programs or arrangements that are required to be aggregated with the Participants Post-2004 Account for purposes of Code Section 409A, and (2) the payment is not greater than the applicable dollar amount under Code Section 402(g)(1)(B).

Maximum Payment Limitation
 
(a)
 
.  Except as provided in subsection (b) below, if any portion of the payments or benefits described in this Plan or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company or its Affiliates (in the aggregate, Total Payments), would constitute an excess parachute payment that is subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments to be made to the Participant shall be reduced such that the value of the aggregate Total Payments that the Participant is entitled to receive shall be one dollar ($1) less than the maximum amount which the Participant may receive without becoming subject to the tax imposed by Sect ion 4999 of the Code; provided that this Section shall not apply in the case of a Participant who has in effect a valid employment contract providing that the Total Payments to the Participant shall be determined without regard to the maximum amount allowable under Section 280G of the Code.  The terms excess parachute payment and parachute payment shall have the meanings assigned to them in Section 280G of the Code, and such parachute payments shall be valued as provided therein.  Present value shall be calculated in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.  Within forty (40) days following delivery of notice by the
Limit on Payments
 
 
39
 
 
Company to the  Participant of its belief that there is a payment or benefit due the Participant which will result in an excess parachute payment as defined in Section 280G of the Code, the Participant and the Company, at the Companys expense, shall obtain the opinion (which need not be unqualified) of nationally recognized tax counsel selected by the Companys independent auditors and acceptable to the Participant in the Participants sole discretion (which may be regular outside counsel to the Company), which opinion sets forth (A) the amount of the base period income, (B) the amount and present value of Total Payments and (C) the amount and present value of any excess parachute payments determined without regard to the limitations of this Section.  As used in this Section, the term base period income mea ns an amount equal to the Participants annualized includible compensation for the base period as defined in Section 280G(d)(1) of the Code.  For purposes of such opinion, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Companys independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code, which determination shall be evidenced in a certificate of such auditors addressed to the Company and the Participant.  Such opinion shall be addressed to the Company and the Participant and shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  If such opinion determines that there would be an excess parachute payment, the payments hereunder that are includible in Total Payments or any other payment or benefit determined by such counsel to be includible in Total Payments shall be reduced or eliminated so that there will be no excess parachute payment.  Such reduction will be achieved by reducing or eliminating payments or benefits in the manner that produces the highest economic value to the Participant; provided that in the event it is determined that the foregoing methodology for reduction would violate Section 409A of the Code, the reduction shall be made pro rata among the benefits and/or payments (on the basis of the relative present value of the parachute payments).  If such legal counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section, the Participant and the Company shall obtain, at the Companys expense, and the legal counsel may rely on in providing the opinion, the advice of a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants as to the reasonableness of any item of compensation to be received by the Participant.  If the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code (or any successor provisions) are repealed without succession, then this Section shall be of no further force or effect.
 
(b)
 
.  The provisions of subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant whose employment is governed by an employment contract that provides for Total Payments in excess of the limitation described in subsection (a) above.

Resolution of Disputes
 
If, after a Change in Control, (a) a dispute arises with respect to the enforcement of the Participants rights under the Plan, or (b) any legal proceeding shall be brought to enforce or interpret any provision contained in the Plan or to recover damages for breach of the Plan, in either case so long as the Participant is not acting in bad faith or otherwise pursuing a course of action that a reasonable person would determine to be frivolous, the Participant shall recover from the Company any reasonable attorneys fees and necessary costs and disbursements incurred as a result of such dispute or legal  proceeding (Expenses), and prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by the Participant calculated at the rate of interest announced by US Bank Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (or any successor thereto), from time to time as

its prime or base lending rate from the date that payments to the Participant should have been made under this Plan.  Within ten (10) days after the Participants written request therefore and reasonable substantiation that such Expense has been incurred, (but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such Expense is incurred), the Company shall pay to the Participant, or such other person or entity as the Participant may designate in writing to the Company, the Participants Expenses in advance of the final disposition or conclusion of any such dispute or legal proceeding.  In the case of a deceased Participant, this Section shall apply with respect to the Participants Beneficiary or estate.

If any delegee of the Committee shall also be a Participant or Beneficiary, any determinations affecting the delegees participation in the Plan shall be made by the Committee.

(b)
 
Cash accounts transferred from the Peoples Plans shall continue to be credited with interest equivalent based on the rate specified in the Peoples Plan (the Prime Rate Investment), unless the Participant is offered the opportunity and elects to transfer such portion of the Participants Account to another Investment Option in accordance with Section 6.01(d).

The distribution shall equal the amount required to be included in the Participants income as a result of such failure.
Accelerated Distribution Following Section 409A Failure
 
(b)
 
.  If a distribution required under the terms of this Plan would jeopardize the ability of the Company or of an Affiliate to continue as a going concern, the Company or the Affiliate shall not be required to make such distribution.  Rather, the distribution shall be delayed until the first date that making the distribution does not jeopardize the ability of the Company or of an Affiliate to continue as a going concern.  Further, if any distribution pursuant to the Plan will violate the terms of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other Federal securities laws, or any other applicable law, then the distribution shall be delayed until the earliest date on which making the distribution will not violate such law.

Section 3.01.  
Eligibility.
 
An Employee is eligible for the Pension Restoration Benefit if:
 
(a)
 
The Committee has designated the Employee for participation in the Pension Restoration Benefit component of the Plan and the Employee, in accordance with Section 1.01(o), has become a Participant in the Pension Restoration Benefit component of the Plan; and
 
(b)
 
The Participant is covered under and has a vested entitlement to a retirement benefit from the Retirement Plan.
 
Section 3.02.  
Pension Restoration Benefit Formula.
 
The Pension Restoration Benefit accrued by an eligible Participant is determined as of the Calculation Date and, when expressed in the form of a life annuity without survivor benefits commencing with a payment for the month in which occurs the Calculation Date, is equal to the difference between (a) and (b) below:
 
(a)
 
The monthly retirement benefit that would be payable to the Participant under the Retirement Plan if the benefit were determined by applying all of the terms and conditions of the Retirement Plan, except for the following modifications or assumptions:
 
(1)
 
The benefit is paid in the form of a life annuity without survivor benefits, regardless of the form of benefit actually elected by the Participant under the Retirement Plan;
 
(2)
 
The benefit is paid commencing with a payment for the month in which occurs the Calculation Date, regardless of the Participants actual date of benefit commencement under the Retirement Plan and regardless of the Payment Date applicable to the Participant under this Plan;
 
 
12
 
 
(3)
 
The benefit is calculated as if base salary and annual bonus (but not long-term bonus) amounts deferred by the Participant under the Integrys Energy Group, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan had been paid to the Participant as current compensation in the year of the deferral;
 
(4)
 
The benefit is calculated as if the compensation limitation of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code and the maximum benefit limitation of Section 415 of the Code did not apply.
 
(b)
 
The monthly retirement benefit that would be payable to the Participant under the Retirement Plan if the benefit were determined in accordance with the modifications or assumptions described in Section 3.02(a)(1) and (2) above, but otherwise applying all of the terms and conditions of the Retirement Plan.  For this purpose, the Participants benefit under the Retirement Plan shall be determined by attributing to the Participant any portion of the Retirement Plan benefit that is assigned to an alternate payee pursuant to a domestic relations order.
 
Section 3.03.  
Distribution of Single Sum Benefits.
 
If the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit is payable in a single sum, distribution will be made in accordance with the following rules:
 
(a)
 
.  The single sum payment will be calculated as of the Calculation Date but paid on the Payment Date.
Time of Payment
 
(b)
 
.  The single sum cash payment shall be equal to the sum of (1) an amount that, as of the Calculation Date, is Actuarially Equivalent to the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit as calculated under Section 3.02 above.  For a married Participant, the single sum benefit does not include the value of any surviving Spouse benefit that would be paid if the Participant had instead elected an annuity benefit, i.e., the single sum benefit is Actuarially Equivalent to the single life annuity with no survivor benefits.  The payment to be made on the Payment Date will equal the sum of (1) the single sum amount determined, a s of the Calculation Date, in accordance with the preceding sentence, and (2)
Amount of Single Sum Benefit
 
 
13
 
 
interest on the single sum amount from the last day of the month in which occurs the Calculation Date through the Payment Date.Interest under clause (2) above, for the period through the last day of the month in which occurs the six (6) month anniversary of the Participants Separation from Service, shall be determined at the 417(e)(3) Rate (first segment rate) in effect under the Retirement Plan for the calendar year in which occurs the Calculation Date.
 
 
(c)
 
.  This Section 3.03 applies only if the Participant is alive on the Payment Date.  If the Participant dies prior to the Payment Date, the benefits (if any) payable following the Participants death shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.06.
Death Prior to Payment Date
 
Section 3.04.  
Distribution of 180 Month Period Certain Installment Benefit.
 
If the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit is payable as a one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit (in accordance with Section 2.02, only certain Participants are eligible for this form of payment), distribution will be made in accordance with the following rules:
 
(a)
 
.  The one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit will be calculated as of the Calculation Date but paid beginning on the Payment Date.
Time of Payment
 
(b)
 
.  The amount of each monthly installment shall be determined by converting the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit as calculated under Section 3.02 above into an Actuarially Equivalent one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit.  For a married Participant, the one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit does not include the value of any surviving Spouse benefit that would be paid if the Participant had instead elected an annuity benefit, i.e., the one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit is Actuarially Equivalent to the single life annuity with no surviv or benefits.  The payment made on the Payment Date will include (1) the Regular Monthly Payment for the month in which occurs the Payment Date, (2) the Retroactive Benefit Payment, and (3) interest on each monthly installment that constitutes part of the Retroactive Benefit Payment for the period from the date on which such installment would have been paid had monthly payments commenced with a payment on the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Date through the Payment Date.  Following the payment on the Payment Date,
Amount of Each Installment
 
 
14
 
 
payments to the eligible Participant in an amount equal to the Regular Monthly Payment shall continue until a total of one hundred eighty (180) monthly payments have been made; provided that for purposes of determining whether a total of one hundred eighty (180) monthly payments have been made, the payment made on the Payment Date will be treated as consisting of seven (7) payments.  Interest under clause (3) above, for the period through the last day of the month in which occurs the six (6) month anniversary of the Participants Separation from Service, shall be determined at the 417(e)(3) Rate  (first segment rate) in effect under  the Retirement Plan for the calendar year in which occurs the Calculation Date.  For example, if the Participant incurs a Separation from Service on December 31, 2009, the Calculation Date is January 1, 2010, the first payment would have been made on January 31, 2010 if payment had commenced with a payment for the month that includes the Calculation Date, and the Payment Date will be July 31, 2010.  Interest on each monthly installment that constitutes part of the Retroactive Benefit Payment for the period from the date on which the monthly installment otherwise would have been paid through the Payment Date will be credited at the 2010 417(e)(3) Rate (first segment rate) in effect under the Retirement Plan.
 
(c)
 
.  This Section 3.04 applies only if the Participant is alive on the Payment Date.  If the Participant dies prior to the Payment Date, the benefits (if any) payable following the Participants death shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.06.

Section 3.05.  
Distribution of Annuity Benefits.
 
If the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit is payable as an annuity, distribution will be made in accordance with the following rules:
 
(a)
 
.  If the Participant has elected (or is deemed to have elected) an annuity form of distribution, then payment for an unmarried Participant will be made in accordance with subsection (a)(1) below, and payment for a married Participant, unless the Participant has validly elected payment in an alternate form of annuity payment in accordance with subsection (b) below, will be made in accordance with subsection (a)(2) below:
Normal Form of Distribution
 
(1)
 
.  If the Participant is not married on the Calculation Date, distribution will be in the form of
Unmarried Participant
 
 
15
 
 
a monthly single life annuity in the amount determined under Section 3.02.  Monthly payments will commence on the Payment Date applicable to the Participant and will continue until and including a payment for the month in which occurs the Participants death.
 
(2)
 
.  If the Participant is married on the Calculation Date, distribution will be in the form of a joint and fifty percent (50%) survivor annuity with the Participants Spouse as of the Calculation Date as the sole contingent annuitant.  Monthly payments under the joint and fifty percent (50%) survivor annuity will commence on the Payment Date applicable to the Participant and will continue until and including a payment for the month in which occurs the Participants death.  If the Participant predeceases the Spouse to whom he or she was married on the Calculation Date, fifty percent (50%) of the Regular Monthly Payment Amount applicable to the Participant during his or her lifetime shall continue during the remaining lifetime of such Spouse.  The Regular Monthly Payment Amount payable to the Participant during his or her lifetime will be the amount determined under Section 3.02 reduced, in order to reflect the cost of the survivor benefit, in the same manner as the benefit would be reduced under Part A or Part C of the Retirement Plan (whichever is applicable to the Participant) if the benefit were being paid under the Retirement Plan.
Married Participant
 
(b)
 
.  In lieu of the normal form of payment applicable under subsection (a) above, a Participant who participates in Part A of the Retirement Plan, who is married on the Calculation Date, and who has in effect an election of the annuity payment method, may elect, in accordance with such conditions as may be established by the Committee, to receive payment in an alternate form of annuity that would be available to the Participant under Part A of the Retirement Plan if the Pension Restoration Benefit were being
Alternate Forms of Annuity Distribution
 
 
16
 
 
paid under Part A of the Retirement Plan rather than under this Plan.  In lieu of the normal form of payment applicable under subsection (a) above, a Participant who participates in Part C of the Retirement Plan and who has in effect an election of the annuity payment method, may elect, in accordance with such conditions as may be established by the Committee, to receive payment in an alternate form of annuity that would be available to the Participant under Part C of the Retirement Plan if the Pension Restoration Benefit were being paid under Part C of the Retirement Plan rather than under this Plan. The alternate form of annuity distribution shall be calculated by converting the monthly benefit amount determined under Section 3.02 into a payment in such alternate annuity form, with the conversion accomplished by using the adjustment factors that w ould be used under the Retirement Plan for purposes of converting from the normal form of benefit to an alternate form of annuity if the Pension Restoration Benefit were being paid under Part A of Part C of the Retirement Plan, whichever is applicable to the Participant.  If the Participant elects payment in an alternate form of annuity that provides surviving Spouse benefits following the Participants death, the surviving Spouse benefits will be paid to the Spouse to whom the Participant is married on the Calculation Date.  The Participants election of an alternate form of annuity must be made prior to the Calculation Date, and becomes irrevocable on the Calculation Date; provided that if the Participant is covered under Part A of the Retirement Plan and is not married on the Calculation Date, any prior election of payment in an alternate form of annuity shall be null and void.
 
(c)
 
. The payment made on the Payment Date will include (1) the Regular Monthly Payment for the month in which occurs the Payment Date, (2) the Retroactive Benefit Payment, and (3) interest on each monthly installment that constitutes part of the Retroactive Benefit Payment for the period from the date on which such installment would have been paid had monthly payments commenced with a payment on the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Date through the Payment Date.  Each subsequent monthly payment to the Participant will be an amount equal to the Regular Monthly Payment.  Interest under clause (3) above, for the period through the last day of the month in which occurs the six (6) month anniversary of the Participants Separation from Service, shall be determined at the 417(e)(3) Rate (first segment rate) in effect under the Retirement Plan for the calendar year in which occurs the Calculation Date.
Regular Monthly Payments and the Retroactive Benefit Payment
 
 
17
 
 
(d)
 
.  This Section 3.05 applies only if the Participant is alive on the Payment Date.  If the Participant dies prior to the Payment Date, the benefits (if any) payable following the Participants death shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.06.
Death Prior to Payment Date
 
Section 3.06.  
Death Benefits.
 
The form and time of benefit distribution is irrevocably established at the earlier to occur of (1) the Payment Date (which, in accordance with Section 1.409A-3(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, is an objectively determinable and nondiscretionary date that is based upon the Participants Separation from Service and that is fixed at the time of the Participants Separation from Service), and (2) the date of the Participants death.
 
(a)
 
.  If a Participant who is eligible for a Pension Restoration Benefit dies prior to the Payment Date (including a Participant who is eligible for a Pension Restoration Benefit who dies during employment), the Participants Beneficiary will receive a single sum payment equal to the single sum payment to which the Participant would have been entitled to as of the Calculation Date if the Participant had in effect a single sum payment election under Article II (regardless of the election actually made by the Participant), together with interest, at the 417(e)(3) Rate (first segment rate) from the last day of the month in which occurs the Calculati on Date through the last day of the month preceding the month in which payment to the Beneficiary is made.
Death Prior to Payment Date
 
(b)
 
.
Death on or After the Payment Date
 
(1)
 
.  If the Participants benefit is being distributed as a one hundred eighty (180) month period certain installment benefit and the Participant dies on or after the Payment Date, i.e., on or after the date on which installment distributions to the Participant have begun, but prior to the date on which one hundred eighty (180) payments have been made, monthly installment distributions to the Beneficiary (at the same time as payments to the Participant would have been made) shall continue until the total number of monthly
Death After Commencement of Installment Payments
 
 
18
 
 
installments paid to the Beneficiary, when aggregated with the number of monthly installments paid to the Participant prior to his or her death, equals one hundred eighty (180).
 
(2)
 
.  If the Participants benefit is being distributed as an annuity and the Participant dies on or after the Payment Date, i.e., on or after the date on which payment of Plan benefits has actually begun, the only benefits payable following the Participants death shall be those (if any) payable under the form of annuity distribution in which the Participants benefit was being paid.  Thus, for example, if the Participant was receiving payments in the form of a single life annuity, no further benefits are payable following the Participants death.  Similarly, if the Participant was receivi ng benefits in the form of a joint and fifty percent (50%) surviving Spouse annuity, the only benefits payable following the Participants death shall be those payable pursuant to the fifty percent (50%) survivor feature of the annuity benefit, to the Spouse (if still living) to whom the Participant was married on the Calculation Date.  There is no guarantee that the total amount of benefits received by the Participant (and if applicable, the Participants surviving Spouse) under an annuity form of distribution will be at least equal to the amount that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had elected distribution in a single sum or in installments.

(a)
 
.  If a Participant who has been designated for participation in the Supplemental Retirement Benefit component of the Plan dies prior to the Payment Date (including a Participant who dies during employment) but after having completed ten (10) or more years of Credited Service, the Participants Beneficiary will receive a single sum payment equal to the single sum payment to which the Participant would have been entitled to as of the Calculation Date if the Participant had in effect a single sum payment election under Article II (regardless of the election actually made by the Participant), together with interest, at the 417(e)(3) Rate (first s egment rate), from the last day of the month in which occurs the Calculation Date through the last day of the month preceding the month in which payment to the Beneficiary is made.

installments paid to the Beneficiary, when aggregated with the number of monthly installments paid to the Participant prior to his or her death, equals one hundred eighty (180).

Thus, for example, if the Participant was receiving payments in the form of a single life annuity, no further benefits are payable following the Participants death.  Similarly, if the Participant was receivi ng benefits in the form of a joint and fifty percent (50%) surviving Spouse annuity, the only benefits payable following the Participants death shall be those payable pursuant to the fifty percent (50%) survivor feature of the annuity benefit, to the Spouse (if still living) to whom the Participant was married on the Calculation Date.  There is no guarantee that the total amount of benefits received by the Participant (and if applicable, the Participants surviving Spouse) under an annuity form of distribution will be at least equal to the amount that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had elected distribution in a single sum or installments.

Following the payment on the Payment Date, payments to the eligible Participant in an amount equal to the Regular Monthly Payment shall continue until a total of one hundred eighty (180) monthly payments have been made; provided that for purposes of determining whether a total of one hundred eighty (180) monthly payments have been made, the payment made on the Payment Date will be treated as consisting of seven (7) payments.  Interest under clause (3) above, for t he period through the last day of the month in which occurs the six (6) month anniversary of the Participants Separation from Service, shall be determined at the 417(e)(3) Rate (first segment rate) in effect under the Retirement Plan for the calendar year in which occurs the Calculation Date.

(a)
 
.

Deferred Compensation Plan that is attributable to Special Defined Contribution Credits into an Actuarially Equivalent annuity benefit in the form of annuity applicable to the Participant (the same form of annuity in which the Participants Pension Restoration Benefit will be distributed).  The actuarial conversion shall be accomplished by first converting the Participants vested account balance into a si ngle life annuity without survivor benefits, and then, if the Participants benefit is being paid in a form of annuity other than a single life annuity without survivor benefits, converting the single life annuity into such other form of annuity in which the Participants benefit will be paid.  If the Participant is married and receiving payment in the form of a joint and survivor annuity, the Supplemental Retirement Plan survivor benefit is not actuarially subsidized, even though the Participant may receive an actuarial subsidy with respect to the Pension Restoration Benefit survivor benefit.

(a)

Maximum Payment Limitation.
 
(a)
 
Except as provided in subsection (b) below, if any portion of the payments or benefits described in this Plan or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company or its Affiliates (in the aggregate, Total Payments), would constitute an excess parachute payment that is subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Total Payments to be made to the Participant shall be reduced such that the value of the aggregate Total Payments that the Participant is entitled to receive shall be one dollar ($1) less than the maximum amount which the Participant may receive without becoming subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.  The terms excess parachute payment and R 20;parachute payment shall have the meanings assigned to them in Section 280G of the Code, and such parachute payments shall be valued as provided therein.  Present value shall be calculated in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.  Within forty (40) days following delivery of notice by the Company to the Participant of its belief that there is a payment or benefit due the Participant which will result in an excess parachute payment as defined in Section 280G of the Code, the Participant and the Company, at the Companys expense, shall obtain the opinion (which need not be unqualified) of nationally recognized tax counsel selected by the Companys independent auditors and acceptable to the Participant in the Participants sole discretion (which may be regular outside counsel to the Company), which opinion sets forth (A) the amount of the base period income, (B) the amount and present value of Total Payments and (C) the amount and present va lue of any excess parachute payments determined without regard to the limitations of this Section.  As used in this Section, the term base period income means an amount equal to the Participants annualized includible compensation for the base period as defined in Section 280G(d)(1) of the Code.  For purposes of such opinion, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Companys independent auditors in accordance with the
 
 
39
 
 
principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code, which determination shall be evidenced in a certificate of such auditors addressed to the Company and the Participant.  Such opinion shall be addressed to the Company and the  Participant and shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant.  If such opinion determines that there would be an excess parachute payment, the payments hereunder that are includible in Total Payments or any other payment or benefit determined by such counsel to be includible in Total Payments shall be reduced or eliminated so that there will be no excess parachute payment.  Such reduction will be achieved by reducing or eliminating payments or benefits in the manner that produces the highest economic value to the Participant; provided that in the event it is determined that the forego ing methodology for reduction would violate Section 409A of the Code, the reduction shall be made pro rata among the benefits and/or payments (on the basis of the relative present value of the parachute payments).  If such legal counsel so requests in connection with the opinion required by this Section, the Participant and the Company shall obtain, at the Companys expense, and the legal counsel may rely on in providing the opinion, the advice of a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants as to the reasonableness of any item of compensation to be received by the Participant.  If the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code are repealed without succession, then this Section shall be of no further force or effect.
 
(b)
 
The provisions of subsection (a) above shall not apply to a Participant whose employment is governed by an employment contract that provides for Total Payments in excess of the limitation described in subsection (a) above.
 
Section 6.04.  
Resolution of Disputes.
 
If, after a Change in Control, (1) a dispute arises with respect to the enforcement of the Participants rights under the Plan, or (2) any legal proceeding shall be brought to enforce or interpret any provision contained in the Plan or to recover damages for breach of the Plan, in either case so long as the Participant is not acting in bad faith or otherwise pursuing a course of action that a reasonable person would determine to be frivolous, the Participant shall recover from the Company any reasonable attorneys fees and necessary costs and disbursements incurred as a result of such dispute or legal proceeding (Expenses), and prejudgment interest on any money judgment obtained by the Participant calculated at the rate of interest announced
 
 
40
 
 
by US Bank Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin (or any successor thereto), from time to time as its prime or base lending rate from the date that payments to the Participant should have been made under this Plan.  Within ten (10) days after the Participants written request therefore and reasonable substantiation that such expenses have been incurred (but in no event later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such Expense is incurred), the Company shall pay to the Participant, or such other person or entity as the Participant may designate in writing to the Company, the Participants Expenses.  The reimbursement shall be made even though a final disposition or conclusion of the dispute or legal proceeding has not been entered.  In the case of a deceased Participant, this S ection shall apply with respect to the Participants Beneficiary or estate.
 
 
41
 
 
Section 7.01.  
Administration.
  The Committee shall administer and interpret the Plan and supervise preparation of Participant elections, forms, and any amendments thereto.  If at any time the Committee shall not be in existence, then all determinations affecting Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 shall be made by the full Board, and all determinations affecting other Participants shall be made by the full Board or an officer appointed by the Board.

45
 
 
(C) the last day of the first calendar year in which payment is administratively practicable.
 
(2)
 
The Board terminates the Plan at any time during the period that begins thirty (30) days prior and ends twelve (12) months following a Change of Control Event (as defined for purposes of Code Section 409A), that all arrangements required to be aggregated with this Plan under Code Section 409A are terminated and liquidated with respect to each Participant that experienced the Change in Control Event, so that all participants under similar arrangements are required to receive all amounts of compensation deferred under the terminated arrangements within twelve (12) months of the date of termination of the arrangements.
provided
 
(3)

In such event, all amounts accrued under the Plan but not yet paid will be distributed to all Participants, Spouses or beneficiaries, as applicable, in a single sum payment no earlier than twelve (12) months (and no later than twenty-four (24) months) after the date of termination, regardless of any distribution election then in effect.  This provision shall not be effective unless all other plans required to be aggregated with this Plan under Code Section 409A are also terminated and liquidated.

In addition, the Company or any Affiliate shall be prohibited from adopting a similar arrangement within three (3) years following the date of the Plans termination, unless any individual who was a
 
 
46
 
 
Participant under this Plan is excluded from participating thereunder for such three (3) year period.
 
(4)
 
Except as provided in Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above or as otherwise permitted in regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code Section 409A, any action that purports to terminate the Plan shall instead be construed as an amendment to discontinue further benefit accruals, but the Plan will continue to operate, in accordance with its terms as from time to time amended in accordance with Sections 6.02 and 7.05, and in accordance with applicable Participant elections, with respect to the Participants benefit accrued through the date of termination, and in no event shall any such action purporting to terminate the Plan form the basis for accelerating distributions to Participants and Beneficiaries.
 
(5)
 
If single sum payments are made in accordance with this Section 7.05, the single sum distribution amount applicable to Participants Pension Restoration Benefit and Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall be determined in accordance with Sections 3.03 and 4.04 as if the date on which the Plan will make the single sum distributions is the Calculation Date (and the single sum distribution amount attributable to the Participants Special Defined Contribution Credits will be equal to the value of the Participants account immediately prior to distribution).

Permitted Delay in Payment

Your entitlement to a Final Award, and the amount and distribution of any Final Award to which you become entitled, shall be governed by the terms of Section 13(b) of the Plan; provided that distribution of any Final Award that becomes payable as a result of your termination of employment shall be distributed upon the earlier to occur of (1) the date distribution would otherwise have been made if your employment had continued, or (2) six (6) months following termination of your employment.& #160;   In addition, if you terminated employment pursuant to Section 6 on account of death, disability or Retirement prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control, the Final Award attributable to your Performance Stock Right (or pro rated Performance Stock Right under Section 6) with respect to any Performance Period that has not been completed as of the date of the Change in Control shall be calculated as of the date of the Change in Control at the target level of performance (or, if greater, the then projected Final Award level).  Distribution shall then be made upon the earlier to occur (1) if the Change in Control constitutes a change in control event within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, as soon as practicable (and not more than ninety (90) days) following the occurrence of such change in control event, or (2) the date on which distribution otherwise would have been made if the Change in Control did not occur.

An additional 25%                                                      2nd anniversary of Grant Date
An additional 25%                                                      3rd anniversary of Grant Date
The final 25%                                                              4th anniversary of Grant Date
, in the event of your  termination of employment from the Company and its Affiliates for any reason, any Optioned Shares not vested as of the date of such termination will be cancelled, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.
provided, however, that
 
Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.

Your partially vested interest will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of service that the you completed during the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12).    If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Opt ioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.
 
  If your employment or service terminates as a result of death or disability (as determined by the Committee based upon the definition set forth in the Companys long-term disability plan), (1) if your termination occurs on or after the first day of the twelfth (12) month following the month  in which occurs the Gran t Date, the Optioned Shares will become fully vested on your date of termination, or (2) if your termination occurs prior to the first day of the twelfth (12) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, you will become partially vested on the date of termination, and the remaining Optioned Shares will be cancelled.  Your partially vested interest will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of service that you completed during the twelve (12) month period that begins on the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12).  If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.
[Alternate Paragraph #1 -- For use in mid-year special grants where proration based on the calendar year might result in substantial vesting shortly following the Grant Date.  Under the alternate paragraph, proration is based on the number of months of employment completed during the one year period from the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date]

  If your employment or service terminates as a result of retirement on or after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of service, or retirement on or after age sixty-two (62) (Retirement), (1) if your Retirement occurs on or after December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment, and (2) if your Retirement occurs prior to December 31 of the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date, a portion of the Optioned Shares will be immediately forfeited, and the remainder of the Optioned Shares will con tinue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment.  The portion of the Optioned Shares that are immediately forfeited will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is twelve (12) minus the number of full months of service that you completed during the calendar year in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12).  If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.  The number of

Optioned Shares available for exercise on or after each vesting date will be reduced by a pro rata portion of the total number of forfeited Optioned Shares.
 
  If your employment or service terminates as a result of retirement on or after age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of service, or retirement on or after age sixty-two (62) (Retirement), (1) if your Retirement occurs on or after the first day of the twelfth (12) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment, and (2) if your Retirement  occurs prior to the first day of the twelfth (12) month following the month in which occurs the Grant Date, a portion of the Optioned Shares will be immediately forfeited, and the remainder of the Optioned Shares will continue to vest, subject to the terms of the Plan, on the same schedule as would have applied had you continued employment.  The portion of the Optioned Shares that are immediately forfeited will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of Optioned Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is twelve (12) minus the number of full months of service that you completed during the twelve (12) month period that begins on the first day of the month in which occurs the Grant Date and the denominator of which is twelve (12).  If the foregoing calculation results in vesting of a fractional Optioned Share, the number of Optioned Shares that become vested will be rounded to the next higher whole number of shares.
