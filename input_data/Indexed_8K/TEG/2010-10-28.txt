On a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis, diluted earnings per share for 2010 is expected to be in the range of $2.61 to $2.78.  This guidance assumes operational improvements and rate relief for certain utilities, the availability of generation units, and normal weather conditions subsequent to September 30, 2010.  This guidance does not include any additional Integrys Energy Group restructur ing costs subsequent to September 30, 2010 related to reductions in workforce that are currently in progress and nearing completion (other than those at Integrys Energy Services related to its strategy change).
Chicago  October 28, 2010 
 
Diluted earnings per share guidance is adjusted for certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  The guidance range for Integrys Energy Groups 2010 diluted earnings per share  adjusted is between $3.00 to $3.17.  Please see the Diluted Earnings per Share Guidance Information at the end of this news release for more detailed information on earnings guidance.
 
This revised guidance for Integrys Energy Groups 2010 diluted earnings per share  adjusted of $3.00 to $3.17 is an improvement to Integrys Energy Groups guidance for 2010 diluted earnings per share  adjusted of $2.89 to $3.17, which was provided at its second quarter earnings conference call on August 5, 2010.  This revised diluted earnings per share  adjusted guidance for 2010 was primarily driven by increased regulated electric sales throughput due to weather.  Additional details regarding this revised guidance for 2010 diluted earnings per share  adjusted, as well as an update to guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share  adjusted will be provided in Integrys Energy Groups third quarter earnings release scheduled to be distributed after market closes on Wednesday , November 3, 2010.

In the third quarter of 2010, Integrys Energy Group recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment loss of $43.2 million ($25.9 million after-tax, or $0.33 per share) related to three natural gas-fired generation plants (Beaver Falls Generation, Syracuse Generation, and the Combined Locks Energy Center) owned by Integrys Energy Services, its wholly owned nonregulated retail energy supply and services subsidiary.  The impairment charge resulted from lower estimated future cash flows for these plants due to reduced expectations for forward capacity prices.  The plants were written down to their estimated fair value.  More details will be included in Integrys Energy Groups Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010, which is expected to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commissio n on Wednesday evening, November 3, 2010.
