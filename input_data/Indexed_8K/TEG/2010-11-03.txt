Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized improved earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009, on an adjusted basis.
Chicago  November 3, 2010 
Net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis was $20.2 million ($0.26 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared with $51.1 million ($0.66 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  In the third quarter of 2010, GAAP earnings included a pre-tax non-cash impairment loss of $43.2 million related to Integrys Energy Services, Inc.s three legacy natural gas-fired generation plants.
Excluding the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, Integrys Energy Group would have recognized adjusted earnings of $27.3 million ($0.35 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared with adjusted earnings of $22.6 million ($0.29 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, an increase of $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter.  Management believes that diluted earnings per share  adjusted and adjusted earnings are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.
Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information and the Non-GAAP Financial Information Reported by Segment, both of which are included at the end of this news release and are also included with the supplemental data package on Integrys Energy Groups website.  These documents provide a reconciliation for Integrys Energy Group between diluted earnings (loss) per share computed on a GAAP basis and diluted earnings (loss) per share  adjusted.  They also provide a reconciliation by reportable segment between net income (loss) attributed to common shareholders and adjusted earnings (loss) and a reconciliation by reportable segment between diluted earnings (loss) per share on a GAAP basis and diluted earnings (loss) per share  adjusted.
"I am pleased with the progress we have made on our financial and operating performance through the third quarter of 2010," said Charles A. Schrock, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group.  "Our consolidated financial results on an adjusted basis improved for the quarter and year to date versus comparable periods a year ago."
 
Schrock added, "Our combined regulated utilities are performing as expected, and our electric generation plants performed well during the warmer than normal summer.  The restructuring at Integrys Energy Services remains on track to be completed by year-end, and our recently-

The net loss attributed to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, of $94.4 million included $257.2 million of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, consisting of a $248.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment loss related to the natural gas utility segment and $13.4 million of restructuring charges, partially offset by $2.6 million of income from discontinued operations related to Integrys Energy Services, and $2.4 million of non-cash gains related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.
Exclusive of these certain items recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, Integrys Energy Groups earnings on an adjusted basis would have increased period-over-period to adjusted earnings of $179.1 million ($2.30 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, from adjusted earnings of $162.8 million ($2.12 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss), which are non-GAAP measures.  Management uses these measures in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose these measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss) are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not compara ble from one period to the next.  Therefore, these measures allow investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
