Also in connection with the Anticipated Offering, the Company is hereby filing a form of Amendment to the Replacement Capital Covenant (the "Form of Amendment") which would amend the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant, dated as of December 1, 2006, by the Company in favor of and for the benefit of certain debtholders (the "Existing RCC") to delete those covenants (Sections 2 and 3 thereof) that currently restrict the Company's ability to redeem or repurchase the Junior Subordinated Notes without the issuance of certain replacement capital securities.

For this purpose, an amendment or supplement that adds new types of securities qualifying as a security or securities covered by clause (i) of Section 2, modifies the requirements of such securities or postpones the termination of this Replacement Capital Covenant will not be deemed materially adverse to the Holders of the then-effective series of Covered Debt if, following such amendment or supplement, the Replacement Capital Covenant would satisfy the definition of Qualifying Replacement Capital Covenant.
