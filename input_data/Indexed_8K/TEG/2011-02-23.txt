Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized a 62.5% improvement in earnings, on an adjusted basis, in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
Chicago  February 23, 2011 
Net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis was $71.7 million ($0.91 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared with $23.2 million ($0.30 diluted earnings per share) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.  During the fourth quarter of 2010, Integrys Energy Group changed its accounting policy related to investment tax credits to provide better matching of the benefit of these credits with the cost of the related investments.  As a result, net income attributed to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2009 was retrospectively adjusted downward by $0.3 million from what was originally reported for the fourth quarter of 2009.
Excluding the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, Integrys Energy Group's adjusted earnings were $64.2 million ($0.82 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared with adjusted earnings of $39.5 million ($0.51 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $24.7 million quarter over quarter.
"We ended a very successful 2010 with solid financial results in the fourth quarter," said Charles A. Schrock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group.  "Considering all we accomplished at the regulated utilities in terms of financial and operational performance and at Integrys Energy Services regarding the completion of our restructuring, 2010 was a very good year."
 
Management believes that adjusted earnings and diluted earnings per share  adjusted are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance. 
Two schedules, which are included at the end of this news release as well as in the supplemental data package on Integrys Energy Groups website, provide details on these non-GAAP measures. These schedules are titled "Diluted Earnings Per Share Information  Non-GAAP Financial Information" and "Non-GAAP Financial Information Reported by Segment."

2010 FULL YEAR RESULTS
Integrys Energy Groups earnings improved 19.5%, on an adjusted basis, in 2010 compared with 2009.
Integrys Energy Group recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $220.9 million ($2.83 diluted earnings per share) for 2010, compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders on a GAAP basis of $69.6 million ($0.91 net loss per share) for 2009.  A change in accounting policy in the fourth quarter of 2010 led to a retrospective positive adjustment of $1.3 million to the previously reported 2009 net loss.  Net income for 2010 includes the $0.9 million positive impact of this accounting policy change.
Excluding the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next, Integrys Energy Group's adjusted earnings were $243.8 million ($3.13 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for 2010, compared with adjusted earnings of $204.0 million ($2.66 diluted earnings per share  adjusted) for 2009, an increase of $39.8 million year over year.
EARNINGS FORECAST
Our guidance range for 2011 consolidated diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis remains between $3.28 and $3.61.  This guidance assumes operational improvements and rate relief for certain utilities, the availability of generation units, and normal weather conditions.
Our guidance range for 2011 consolidated diluted earnings per share  adjusted also remains between $3.24 and $3.57.  This guidance is adjusted for certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please see the Diluted Earnings Per Share Guidance Information included at the end of this news release and in the supplemental data package on the company's website for more detailed information on earnings guidance.
Integrys Energy Group expects a long-term diluted earnings per share  adjusted growth rate of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis, using 2011 as the base year, through 2015.
Integrys Energy Groups management will discuss earnings guidance for 2011 during the earnings conference call at 8 a.m. CST on Thursday, February 24, 2011.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
Integrys Energy Group prepares financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Along with this information, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss), which are non-GAAP measures.  Management uses these measures in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose these measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss) are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance because they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not compara ble from one period to the next.  Therefore, these measures allow investors to better compare our financial results from period to period.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
