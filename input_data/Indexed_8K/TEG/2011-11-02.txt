NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) today reported earnings on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis and an adjusted basis as follows:
Chicago November 2, 2011 
Adjusted earnings exclude the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.
The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were an overall decrease in operating expenses and higher margins in the retail electric markets in which Integrys Energy Services continues to operate.
Operating expenses were lower due to a continuing effort to control costs, as well as decreases in stock-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of certain plans.
Integrys Energy Services retail electric markets had positive results driven by higher unit margins and sales volumes resulting from the change in pricing and customer mix that was implemented as part of its strategy change.
Partially offsetting the increase in adjusted earnings was a decrease in regulated electric utility margins. Differences between the current Wisconsin Public Service rate order and the previous rate order drove the decrease.

Non-GAAP Financial Informatio
We prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  In addition, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss), which are non-GAAP measures.  Management uses these measures in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose these measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss) are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance.  These measures allow investors to better compare our financial results from period to period, as they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable.  This additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.
