Integrys Energy Group, Inc. Reports Improved Third Quarter 2012 Earnings
Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE: TEG) recognized earnings on a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis and an adjusted basis as follows:
Chicago  November 5, 2012 
Adjusted earnings exclude the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.
Third Quarter Results
Earnings were up this quarter compared with the same quarter last year on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis. Rate increases effective in January 2012 at The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company, North Shore Gas Company, and Upper Peninsula Power Company drove the increase in adjusted earnings. In addition, maintenance expense at the electric utilities was down quarter over quarter, mainly due to fewer storms in their service territories.

Partially offsetting the increase in adjusted earnings was the impact of lower sales volumes at the natural gas utilities due to lower use per residential customer in the third quarter of 2012. In addition, wholesale electric utility sales volumes were down.
Weather did not have a significant impact on quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings.
"I am extremely pleased with the strong adjusted financial results in the third quarter of 2012," said Charles A. Schrock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys Energy Group. "Continued cost control efforts by our employees contributed to the increase in our guidance for 2012 diluted earnings per share  adjusted."
EARNINGS FORECAST
Integrys Energy Groups guidance range for 2012 diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis was increased to between $3.19 and $3.37. This guidance assumes continued operational improvements, the availability of generation units, and normal weather conditions for the rest of 2012. The company's guidance range for 2012 diluted earnings per share  adjusted was increased to between $3.22 and $3.38. Integrys Energy Group is not estimating the impact of derivative and inventory fair value accounting activities for 2012.

Diluted Earnings Per Share Information (Non-GAAP Information)
We prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  In addition, we disclose and discuss diluted earnings per share (EPS)  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss), which are non-GAAP measures.  Management uses these measures in its internal performance reporting and for reports to the Board of Directors.  We disclose these measures in our quarterly earnings releases, on investor conference calls, and during investor conferences and related events.  Management believes that diluted EPS  adjusted and adjusted earnings (loss) are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance.  These measures allow investors to better compare our financial results from period to period, as they eliminate the effects of certain items that are not comparable.  This additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results of operations prepared and presented in conformance with GAAP.  Tax impacts are calculated using the applicable combined federal and state statutory rate modified for any attributable permanent tax effect and/or tax credit.
