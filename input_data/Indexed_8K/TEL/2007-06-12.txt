Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
        On June 7, 2007, the Board of Directors of Tyco International Ltd. authorized the divestiture of our Power Systems business and delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of Tyco Electronics the authority to determine whether or not to proceed with the divestiture of Power Systems based on the specific terms and conditions of any sale proposal. As a result, Tyco Electronics assessed the Power Systems assets for impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
and determined the Power Systems assets are impaired. Tyco Electronics currently estimates that the impairment is approximately $500 million pre-tax and $370 million after-tax. Tyco Electronics expects to record the impairment charge in the three month period ended June 29, 2007 and will report Power Systems as a discontinued operation.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
