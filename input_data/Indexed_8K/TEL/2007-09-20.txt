ITEM 2.02             RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
The information disclosed in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is furnished and incorporated by reference in this Item 2.02.  The financial information referred to therein is furnished as Exhibit 99.1, Exhibit 99.2, Exhibit 99.3, and Exhibit 99.4 to this report and incorporated by reference in this Item 2.02.
ITEM 7.01             REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
On June 7, 2007, the board of directors of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International") authorized the divestiture of its Power Systems business and delegated to the chief executive officer of Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics") the authority to determine whether to proceed with the divestiture of the Power Systems business.  Subsequent to the separation of Tyco Electronics from Tyco International on June 29, 2007, the Power Systems business was held by Tyco Electronics and the Tyco Electronics board of directors re-authorized the divestiture.  At that time, the Power Systems business met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria, and Tyco Electronics reclassified amounts previously reported to reflect this business in discontinued operations in all periods presented.
The financial information furnished with this report and incorporated by reference includes the combined statements of operations, the combined statements of cash flows, and the combined segment results of Tyco Electronics for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2006, September 30, 2005, and September 30, 2004, as well as the combined balance sheets of Tyco Electronics as of September 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005.
The financial information reflects Power Systems as a discontinued operation. This information may not reflect the results of operations that would have resulted had Tyco Electronics been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company during such periods. In addition, it is not necessarily indicative of Tyco Electronics' future results of operations.
