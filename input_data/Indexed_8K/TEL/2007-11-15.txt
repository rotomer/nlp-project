PEMBROKE, BermudaNov. 15, 2007Tyco Electronics Ltd. (NYSE: TEL; BSX: TEL) today reported net sales of $3.6 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, 2007, an increase of 11 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding currency effects, organic sales growth was 8 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations was $0.53 for the quarter. Included in EPS from continuing operations were $0.06 per share of net charges related to restructuring, separation and other items. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.59 in the quarter.
"Our fourth quarter was a good finish to our fiscal year and I was pleased with our progress against our financial and strategic objectives," said Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch. "Our strong sales growth was largely due to continued strength in our international markets, which account for more than 60 percent of our sales, along with another very strong quarter in our Undersea Telecommunications business. Our operating margin was better than we anticipated due to the higher sales. We also made good progress on our strategic initiatives as we accelerated our manufacturing simplification activities and, in early October, we announced an agreement to sell our Power Systems business. In addition, we essentially completed our debt structure, announced a $750 million share repurchase program and declared our first dividend payment."
Organic Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Margin and Free Cash Flow are all non-GAAP financial measures and are described near the end of this press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, see the attached tables. All dollar amounts
are pre-tax and stated in millions. All comparisons are to the quarter ended Sept. 29, 2006 unless otherwise indicated.
GAAP operating income was $443 million, compared to $158 million in the prior-year period. The operating margin on a GAAP basis was 12.2 percent, compared to 4.9 percent in the prior-year period. Included in operating income were restructuring-related costs of $59 million and separation-related costs of $20 million, partially offset by a $24 million gain on the sale of real estate and $4 million of income related to an insurance recovery. Operating income in the prior-year quarter included a $316 million goodwill impairment charge and $5 million of restructuring-related costs. Excluding these items in both periods, adjusted operating income was $494 million, compared to $479 million a year ago. The adjusted operating margin was 13.7 percent, compared to 14.7 percent a year ago. Consistent with the prior two quarters, the year-over-year decline in the operating margin was largely due to lower production levels in the Electronic Components segment and a lower margin sales mix compared to last year.
CASH FLOW
Cash provided by operating activities was $655 million in the quarter, an increase of 11 percent over the prior-year quarter and free cash flow was $545 million. The increase was largely due to improved inventory performance compared to the prior-year quarter.
Gross capital expenditures were $145 million in the quarter, consistent with the company's expected long-term capital investment levels of 4 to 5 percent of sales. Net capital expenditures were $110 million, which reflected gross capital expenditures less $35 million of proceeds from the sale of real estate. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $936 million.
OTHER ITEMS
 - 
During the quarter, the company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a $750 million share repurchase program and declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share, which was paid on Nov. 1.
 - 
On Oct. 19, the company announced the execution of an agreement to sell its Power Systems business for $100 million in cash, subject to a final working capital adjustment. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2007 or early in 2008.
ORDERS
Excluding the company's Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments, which are project-oriented businesses with uneven order patterns, orders grew 8 percent organically in the quarter and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.99. Total company orders grew 4 percent organically in the quarter compared to the prior year, and the book-to-bill ratio was 0.93.
OUTLOOK
For the full year 2008, the company expects organic sales growth of 6 to 8 percent and EPS from continuing operations of $2.23 to $2.33, including restructuring and separation-related costs of approximately $130 million ($0.17 per share). This compares to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $0.29 per share in fiscal 2007, which included $2.33 per share of net charges related to the Tyco International shareholder litigation settlement, separation-related costs and other items. Excluding these charges, EPS in the prior year was $2.04, which included restructuring-related costs of $107 million ($0.14 per share). On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring and other items, the company expects EPS from continuing operations of $2.40 to $2.50 in 2008, compared to $2.18 in the prior year, an increase of 10 to 15 percent.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the company expects sales growth of 14 to 16 percent over prior-year sales of $3.1 billion, with organic sales growth of 10 to 12 percent. Excluding the strong growth expected in the company's Undersea Telecommunications segment, the company expects organic sales growth of 4 to 6 percent. The company further expects diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.51 to $0.53 including restructuring and separation-related costs of approximately $40 million ($0.05 per share). This compares to EPS of $0.48 per share in the prior-year quarter, which included separation and restructuring-related costs of $12 million ($0.02 per share). On an adjusted basis, first quarter EPS is expected to be $0.56 to $0.58 compared to $0.50 last year, an increase of 12 to 16 percent.
Lynch said, "For the full year, we expect continued growth in our international markets and relatively flat sales in the U.S. The growth in our Undersea Telecommunications business is expected to be very strong in the first quarter before tapering off over the balance of the year." Lynch continued, "We expect to see solid improvement in our operating margin before restructuring costs in 2008 as we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities and our EPS will also benefit slightly from our recently-announced share repurchase plan. In the first quarter, our adjusted operating margin should be flat-to-slightly higher than last year's adjusted margin of 13.1 percent."
SEGMENT RESULTS
Tyco Electronics is comprised of four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications.
Electronic Components
The Electronic Components segment is the world's largest supplier of passive electronic components, including connectors and interconnect systems, relays, switches, circuit protection devices, touchscreens, sensors, and wire and cable.
Sales in the segment grew 8 percent year over year, or 4 percent organically. On an organic basis, growth was driven by strength in the communications (+12 percent), industrial machinery (+9 percent), aerospace and defense (+8 percent), consumer electronics (+8 percent) and automotive (+7 percent) markets. This growth was partially offset by a 4 percent decline in the computer market, primarily
driven by the strategic decision to exit certain low-margin business and relatively flat sales in our appliance market. On a geographic basis, segment sales grew 10 percent organically in Asia, 4 percent in Europe, and declined 3 percent in the Americas.
Operating income decreased by $5 million, due entirely to restructuring-related costs. Adjusted operating income grew $17 million, due to higher sales levels. The adjusted operating margin decreased by 40 basis points due primarily to lower production and productivity levels in North America, particularly in automotive, communications equipment and housing-related markets. Restructuring-related costs in the quarter were $23 million, compared to $1 million in the prior-year quarter.
Network Solutions
The Network Solutions segment is a supplier of infrastructure components and systems for telecommunications and energy networks.
Segment sales grew 13 percent compared to the prior-year quarter, or 7 percent organically. On an organic basis, sales to the building networks market grew 17 percent, reflecting strong demand for faster and more secure networks and higher pricing on copper cabling products. Sales to the communication service provider market increased 7 percent, due to an increase in sales of fiber optic network components. Sales to the energy market grew 4 percent, reflecting growth in Europe and Asia.
Operating income decreased by $24 million, due to restructuring-related costs. Adjusted operating income increased by $6 million, due to the increase in sales. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin primarily relates to a lower margin sales mix compared to the prior year. Restructuring-related costs in the quarter were $31 million, compared to $1 million in the prior-year quarter.
Wireless Systems
The Wireless Systems segment is a leading innovator of wireless technology for critical communications, radar and defense applications.
Sales in the segment were essentially flat year over year. Modest growth in the wireless networks and aerospace and defense businesses was offset by a decline in the commercial products business, primarily due to continued softness in the wireless infrastructure market.
Operating income increased by $329 million, primarily due to a $316 million goodwill impairment charge in last year's fourth quarter. The current quarter included a $24 million gain related to the sale of real estate. On an adjusted basis, the decrease in the operating margin was largely due to the softness in the wireless infrastructure market. Restructuring-related costs in both the current and year-ago quarter were $3 million.
Undersea Telecommunications
The company's Undersea Telecommunications segment installs and maintains undersea telecommunication systems.
Sales in the segment grew 122 percent organically versus the prior year due to the continued construction of a large trans-Pacific network project. Adjusted operating income increased $3 million, driven by the increased sales. The adjusted operating margin decline was primarily due to $8 million of income in the prior-year quarter related to divestitures in this segment. Restructuring-related costs in the quarter were $2 million, compared to no such costs in the prior-year quarter.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
"Organic Sales Growth," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Earnings Per Share," "Adjusted Operating Margin," and "Free Cash Flow" (FCF) are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
"Organic Sales Growth" is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Organic Sales Growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Organic Sales Growth is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. It is also a component of the company's compensation programs. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's sales. This limitation is best addressed by using organic sales growth in combination with the GAAP numbers. See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of Organic Sales Growth.
The company has presented its operating income before unusual items including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Income"). The company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans. Adjusted Operating Income is a useful measure for investors because it better reflects the company's underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods. The difference between Adjusted Operating Income and operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges related to litigation settlement costs, separation-related costs and restructuring costs and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease the company's reported operating income. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Operating Income in combination with operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
The company has presented adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is earnings per share from continuing operations before unusual items, including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs, loss on retirement of debt and other income or charges ("Adjusted Earnings Per Share"). The company presents Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to our results in accordance with GAAP. We believe such a measure provides a picture of our results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of unusual items, which may recur occasionally, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby making comparisons between periods more difficult. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Earnings Per Share in combination with earnings per share (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
The company has presented its operating margin before unusual items including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Margin"). The company presents and forecasts its Adjusted Operating Margin before unusual items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results. Because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items and the associated charges or gains that will be recorded in the company's financial statements, it is difficult to include the impact of those items in the forecast.
"Free Cash Flow" (FCF) is a useful measure of the company's cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. The difference between cash flows from operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash
outflows that the company believes are useful to identify. FCF permits management and investors to gain insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans. The difference reflects the impact from:
 - 
net capital expenditures,
 - 
voluntary pension contributions,
 - 
cash impact of unusual items
Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. The company forecasts its cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contributions because it has not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any future such contributions. In addition, the company's forecast excludes the cash impact of unusual items because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items.
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it subtracts cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and that therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period. See the accompanying tables to this press release for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF.
