ITEM 8.01    OTHER EVENTS
        As previously announced, in March 2008, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company") was authorized by its board of directors to pursue the divestiture of its Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business, and in May 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for $425 million in cash. The Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business, which formerly was part of the Company's Wireless Systems segment, met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and was reflected as such in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 28, 2008.
        This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to retrospectively adjust the following sections of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 to reflect the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business as a discontinued operation in all periods presented:
 - 
Item 6. Selected Financial Data;
 - 
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
        The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, particularly in "Forward-Looking Information," as well as those discussed in "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007.
Separation From Tyco International Ltd.
        Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company", which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation").
        The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded entity as of June 29, 2007 and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., prior to June 29, 2007.
        Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented, including changes in our operations and capitalization as a result of our separation from Tyco International. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, and other expenses as well as debt and related net interest expense for periods prior to the Separation have been allocated to us by Tyco International. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of our actual results had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding allocated expenses.
        As discussed elsewhere in this Report, prior to the Separation, we used the corporate services of Tyco International for a variety of functions including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, and risk management. We currently perform these functions. The costs of these functions may be different than prior to the Separation. We also may incur additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly-traded company. These additional anticipated costs are not reflected in our historical Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to June 29, 2007.
Overview
        We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, undersea telecommunication systems, and wireless systems. We operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Undersea Telecommunications, and Wireless Systems. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 500,000 different products for customers in industries
ranging from automotive, appliance, and aerospace and defense to telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for electronic components.
        We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by over 7,000 engineers, as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers anywhere in the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs.
        Our strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities:
 - 
continue to focus our existing portfolio;
 - 
leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share;
 - 
achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries;
 - 
extend our leadership in key emerging markets;
 - 
supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions;
 - 
improve operating margins; and
 - 
accelerate new product development through research and development excellence.
        Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include:
 - 
Market conditions.
    We have experienced sales growth that was driven by the continued increased use of electronics across the end markets that we serve. This sales growth was achieved despite industry pricing pressures. Over the periods shown, we have experienced price erosion in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect price erosion to continue in the future. The increase in our net sales for each fiscal year in the periods shown reflects volume increases that more than offset the impact of pricing pressures.
 - 
Raw material price increases.
    We purchase approximately 200 million pounds of copper and approximately 250,000 troy ounces of gold annually. During the periods shown, the prices of these key raw materials, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have increased substantially. The following table illustrates the increase in average prices related to the most significant raw materials, copper and gold, during the periods presented:
As a general matter, we have been able to pass only a portion of the increased cost of these raw materials through to our customers. As a result, raw materials price increases adversely affected our gross margins.
 - 
Foreign exchange.
    Approximately 52% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end
of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2007 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:
Discontinued Operations
        In March 2008, our board of directors authorized us to pursue the divestiture of our Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business, and in May 2008, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business for $425 million in cash. The sale transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2008. We have reclassified amounts previously reported to reflect this business as a discontinued operation in all periods presented. Prior to reclassification to held for sale, this business was a component of our Wireless Systems segment. See Note 26 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information.
        The divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, we assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144
, "Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
using a probability-weighted set of expected cash flows from the eventual disposition. We recorded a $435 million after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Subsequent to year end, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $56 million pre-tax gain on the sale. The proceeds received are subject to a final working capital adjustment. For additional information, see Note 26 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report.
        During 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our Printed Circuit Group business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.
        The Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale, these businesses were components of the Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Divestitures and Manufacturing Simplification
        As part of our strategy, we regularly review and consider the divestiture of underperforming or non-strategic businesses to improve our operating results and better utilize our capital. Some of these divestitures may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently believe that these divestitures, including the anticipated divestiture of our Radio Frequency Subsystem business discussed above, the divestiture of the Power Systems business discussed above, and other product exits, could reduce our consolidated net sales by approximately 15%. We have made strategic divestitures in
the past, such as our Printed Circuit Group business discussed above, and expect that we may make additional divestitures in the future.
        We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from high-cost to low-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to low-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us to maintain our competitiveness in the industry. In connection with our manufacturing rationalization plan, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $130 million in fiscal 2008 and up to $250 million from fiscal 2009 through 2010.
        In November 2004, we agreed to sell the Tyco Global Network, our undersea fiber optic telecommunications network. This business had been part of our Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. We closed this sale on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale, we received cash proceeds of $130 million, and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. The divestiture resulted in a pre-tax gain on sale of $301 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding divestitures.
Class Action Settlement
        On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding does not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA").
        Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs have agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants, and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class. The parties to the memorandum of understanding applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held, and the court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued shortly. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the memorandum of understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.
        Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement that was entered into in connection with the Separation, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow account with Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total settlement amount.
        In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers, of which $31 million has been collected. The net charge of $887 million has been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as allocated class action settlement costs, net. The portions allocated to us are consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class. In addition, interest is accrued on the class action settlement liability. At fiscal year end 2007, we recorded $928 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for our portion of the escrow. We also recorded a $2,992 million liability and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the liability at fiscal year end 2007.
        If the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, our share of any additional potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
        Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure which we use to measure the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.
        We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP.
Consolidated and Combined Operations
        The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown.
        Net Sales.
    Net sales increased $1,148 million, or 9.7%, to $12,959 million in fiscal 2007 from $11,811 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, net sales increased $887 million, or 8.1%, to $11,811 million from $10,924 million in fiscal 2005. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the euro, favorably impacted net sales by $429 million, or 3.6%, in fiscal 2007, negatively impacted net sales by $172 million, or 1.6%, in fiscal 2006, and favorably impacted net sales by $281 million, or 2.8%, in fiscal 2005. On an organic basis, net sales increased 5.9% in fiscal 2007 primarily reflecting strong growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment and sales in international markets. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, organic net sales growth was 9.9% and 5.6%, respectively, reflecting increases in volume partially offset by price erosion. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $197 million in fiscal 2007, $286 million in fiscal 2006, and $387 million in fiscal 2005. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment.
        The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region:

Represents the change in net sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
        Cost of Sales and Gross Income.
    In fiscal 2007, gross income increased by $145 million over fiscal 2006; however, gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points. Our margin percentage declined due to higher organic growth in lower margin markets such as Undersea Telecommunications. We also were negatively impacted by lower plant productivity in North America as a result of sales declines in that market by our Electronic Components segment in fiscal 2007.
        Gross income increased by $216 million in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005, but decreased as a percentage of net sales by 30 basis points. This decline as a percentage of net sales was attributable to increases in raw material costs, primarily metals, which unfavorably affected fiscal 2006 gross income by $293 million when compared to fiscal 2005.
        Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.
    Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.3% and 12.2% in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Prior to Separation, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International, which decreased by $25 million to $152 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to $177 million in fiscal 2006. We incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to building separate company functions that did not exist in the prior fiscal year. A portion of these costs were duplicative in fiscal 2007 as we were also allocated costs related to these functions from Tyco International until the Separation date.
        Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.2% in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include the effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, "
Share Based Payment,"
which resulted in incremental stock option charges of $40 million in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005.
        Allocated Class Action Settlement Costs, Net.
    As discussed above, in connection with the class action settlement, we were allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million in fiscal 2007. See Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding the class action settlement and allocated net costs.
        Separation Costs.
    In connection with the Separation, we incurred costs of $44 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including $11 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the conversion of share option awards at Separation and $12 million related to the acceleration of restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards and the acceleration of restricted share award vesting.
        Restructuring and Other Charges (Credits), Net.
    Net restructuring and other charges were $92 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $7 million in fiscal 2006. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, increased $84 million to $97 million in fiscal 2007 from $13 million in fiscal 2006. Increases resulted from our strategic priority to simplify our manufacturing footprint.
        During fiscal 2007, we initiated restructuring actions to exit manufacturing operations and migrate product lines to low cost countries in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments and to rationalize certain product lines in the Wireless Systems segment. Restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2007 primarily related to employee severance and benefits.
        Net restructuring and other credits of $11 million in fiscal 2005 primarily resulted from the sale of previously written down assets for amounts greater than originally estimated and the completion of exit activities related to previously acquired operations for amounts less than originally established as acquisition liabilities.
        See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding restructuring and other charges (credits), net.
        Gain on Divestiture.
    In fiscal 2005, income from continuing operations benefited from the pre-tax $301 million gain on the divestiture of the Tyco Global Network.
        Income from Operations.
    Income from operations was $716 million, or 5.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,742 million, or 14.7%, of net sales, in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted
primarily from allocated net class action settlement costs of $887 million in fiscal 2007 and a higher level of restructuring and other charges of $84 million related to our strategic initiative to simplify our manufacturing operations.
        Income from operations was $1,742 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $1,961 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was driven by a gain on divestiture in fiscal 2005 of $301 million. The remaining change was driven by an increase in net sales negatively offset by increased raw material costs.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006
        Electronic Components' net sales increased $725 million, or 7.7%, to $10,111 million in fiscal 2007 from $9,386 million in fiscal 2006. Approximately $333 million, or 3.5%, of the increase was due to the strengthening of certain foreign currencies in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth of 4.0% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to increases in volume partially offset by price erosion.
        In fiscal 2007, Electronic Components' organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the consumer electronics, industrial machinery, and aerospace and defense end markets. Our organic growth of 11.7% in the consumer electronics market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from continued strong consumer demand as well as our continued focus on this market. In the industrial machinery market, our organic net sales growth of 11.5% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from strong demand globally as companies continued to invest in factory automation. In the aerospace and defense market, our organic net sales growth of 10.5% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was driven primarily by strength in North America and Europe in the commercial aerospace market. Our organic net sales growth of 5.4% in the automotive market in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was attributable to growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 13.0% and the EMEA region of 5.4% partially offset by a decline in the North America region that was driven by reduced production by automotive manufacturers. Finally, in the computer market, our organic net sales declined 3.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to a strategic decision to exit certain low-margin products which negatively impacted net sales by $83 million.
        Electronic Components' operating income decreased $65 million, or 4.6%, to $1,339 million fiscal 2007 from $1,404 million in fiscal 2006. Benefits from higher sales and favorable foreign currency increases were reduced by lower productivity resulting from sales declines in North America primarily in automotive, housing related, and communication equipment markets. Also, restructuring costs in
fiscal 2007 increased $45 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $33 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006.
Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005
        In fiscal 2006, Electronic Components' net sales increased $629 million, or 7.2%, to $9,386 million from $8,757 million in fiscal 2005. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $151 million, or 1.7%. Organic net sales growth of 8.8% in fiscal 2006 resulted from increases in volume partially offset by price erosion.
        Electronic Components' fiscal 2006 organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the communication equipment, computer, industrial machinery, and consumer electronics markets. Our organic net sales growth of 15.8% in the communication equipment market in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was driven by strong demand across the entire market including infrastructure equipment and mobile phones. In the computer market, our organic net sales growth of 11.5% was driven by computer shipment growth that was strong throughout all of fiscal 2006. In the industrial machinery market, our organic net sales growth of 22.0% resulted from strong demand globally as companies continued to invest in factory automation. In the consumer electronics market, our organic net sales growth of 19.1% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was attributable to continued strong consumer demand as well as our continued increased focus on this market. Our organic net sales growth of 5.0% in the automotive market resulted from strong growth in Asia-Pacific of 8.5% offset by flat sales in EMEA and the Americas. In the aerospace and defense market, our organic net sales growth slowed to 3.1% in fiscal 2006 due to a slowdown in defense electronics spending in the programs in which we participate, offset by increased sales related to commercial aircraft builds.
        Electronic Components' operating income increased $6 million to $1,404 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,398 million in fiscal 2005. Benefits from increased sales volume and cost improvement initiatives were offset by price erosion and increased raw material prices in fiscal 2006. Increased raw material costs negatively affected margins by $261 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Also, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R negatively affected fiscal 2006 results by $33 million. Finally, the weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively impacted fiscal 2006 results by $19 million as compared to fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006
        Network Solutions' net sales increased $157 million, or 9.0%, to $1,897 million in fiscal 2007 from $1,740 million in fiscal 2006. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro, favorably affected net sales by $96 million, or 5.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006. Organic net sales growth was $61 million, or 3.5%, in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006.
        In fiscal 2007, Network Solutions' organic net sales growth was strong in the building networks and energy end markets; however, our organic net sales declined in the communication service provider market. In the building networks market, our organic net sales growth of 16.2% in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 resulted from higher pricing on copper cabling products as well as increases in non-residential construction spending and network upgrades in existing buildings. Our organic net sales growth of 5.7% in the energy market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted from solid growth in EMEA due to continued strong demand for high voltage products used to replace/upgrade aging grids in developed countries. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 7.4% in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting a pause in spending on fiber network deployments by certain operators compared to strong sales in the same period last year due to hurricane-related spending in the Americas and the accelerated build-out of fiber networks by certain operators in Europe.
        Network Solutions' operating income decreased $37 million, or 13.8%, to $231 million in fiscal 2007 from $268 million in fiscal 2006. Price increases offset increased raw material costs. The operating income decrease resulted from a $26 million increase in restructuring cost and a lower margin sales mix due to the sales decline in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Also, in fiscal 2007, we incurred $5 million of costs related to our separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006.
Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005
        Network Solutions' net sales increased $214 million, or 14.0%, to $1,740 million in fiscal 2006 from $1,526 million in fiscal 2005. Organic net sales growth of $238 million, or 15.6%, in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005, resulted primarily from increases in volume. Organic net sales growth was partially offset by
$24 million, or 1.6%, of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The impact of price erosion on fiscal 2006 net sales was minimal as a result of our pricing actions to recover material cost increases.
        In fiscal 2006, Network Solutions' organic net sales growth was strong across the energy, communication service provider, and building networks industry end markets. In the energy market, our organic net sales growth of 10.1% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the continued increased spending on grid infrastructure improvements, as well as the build-out of the grid infrastructure in emerging markets. Our organic growth of 22.3% in the communication service provider market in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was driven by the continued build-out by certain operators in Europe and the United States of fiber networks and, to a lesser extent, sales that were driven by the rebuilding required in the United States resulting from hurricane activity. In the building networks market, our organic growth of 19.9% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 resulted from increased non-residential construction spending, increased spending to upgrade networks in existing buildings, and increased pricing to offset increased raw material costs.
        Network Solutions' operating income increased $43 million, or 19.1%, to $268 million in fiscal 2006 from $225 million in fiscal 2005. The improvement was driven by the net sales growth of 14.0% in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005. The benefits of pricing actions and cost improvement initiatives were partially offset by increased raw material costs, primarily metals, of $28 million in fiscal 2006 and the $4 million negative impact related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2006.
Undersea Telecommunications
Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006
        Net sales in the Undersea Telecommunications segment increased $265 million, or 88.3%, to $565 million in fiscal 2007 from $300 million in fiscal 2006. On an organic basis, net sales increased by 88.9% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 from our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and China as well as a project in the oil and gas market.
        Undersea Telecommunications had operating income of $38 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $15 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of increases in sales. Restructuring costs in fiscal 2007 increased $9 million as compared to fiscal 2006, and segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our separation from Tyco International that did not exist in fiscal 2006.
Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005
        Net sales in the Undersea Telecommunications segment increased $21 million, or 7.5%, to $300 million in fiscal 2006 from $279 million in fiscal 2005. Organic net sales growth of 17.4% was driven by the continued increase in the number of regional system builds and upgrades of existing systems. Foreign currencies had a minimal impact on net sales. Fiscal 2006 net sales were negatively affected by the fiscal 2005 divestiture of the Tyco Global Network, which reported fiscal 2005 net sales of approximately $29 million.
        The Undersea Telecommunications segment had operating income of $15 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $292 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, operating income benefited from the
$301 million gain on the sale of the Tyco Global Network. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R negatively affected fiscal 2006 operating income by $1 million.
Wireless Systems
Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006
        In fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems' net sales increased $1 million to $386 million from $385 million in fiscal 2006. Organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 as increases in government spending in the public safety market offset reduced demand for equipment related to public safety channel re-banding programs. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates was minimal.
        In fiscal 2007, Wireless Systems' operating income decreased $16 million, or 29.1%, to $39 million from $55 million in fiscal 2006. Increased engineering and selling investment in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 negatively impacted operating income. In addition, operating income was negatively impacted by increased restructuring costs of $4 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and $2 million of costs related to our separation from Tyco International in fiscal 2007 that did not exist in fiscal 2006.
Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005
        Wireless Systems' net sales increased $23 million, or 6.4%, to $385 million in fiscal 2006 from $362 million in fiscal 2005. Organic net sales of growth 5.9% in fiscal 2006 was driven by demand for equipment related to the federally mandated public safety channel re-banding program. The impact of foreign currency translation was minimal.
        Wireless Systems' operating income increased $9 million, or 19.6%, to $55 million in fiscal 2006 from $46 million in fiscal 2005 primarily as a result of increased sales. Wireless Systems' fiscal 2006 operating income was negatively impacted by $2 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2006.
Non-Operating Items
Interest Expense, Net
        Interest expense, net was $178 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $208 million in fiscal 2006 and $248 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease of $30 million, or 14.4%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was driven by lower average debt levels. Decreases in net interest expense allocated by Tyco International were partially offset by interest incurred on our unsecured senior bridge loan and unsecured senior revolving credit facilities. The decrease of $40 million, or 16.1%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was driven by a reduction in net interest expense allocated by Tyco International reflecting lower average debt levels offset by higher borrowing rates.
        A portion of Tyco International's net interest expense was allocated to us through June 1, 2007. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, we were allocated net interest expense of $130 million, $201 million, and $239 million, respectively, which includes the effects of Tyco International's interest rate swaps. Management believes the interest expense allocation basis was reasonable. However, these
amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for these periods.
Other Expense, Net
        Other expense, net of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, we recorded other income of $13 million associated with Tyco International's and Covidien's share of certain contingent tax liabilities for unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International.
        Other expense, net of $365 million in fiscal 2005 consisted primarily of an expense allocation from Tyco International related to our portion of Tyco International's loss on retirement of debt.
Income Taxes
        Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 includes the effects of the pre-tax charges recorded in connection with the allocated class action settlement and the allocated loss on the retirement of debt for which no tax benefits were recorded. These impacts on the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 were $312 million and $81 million, respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects tax detriments related to increased borrowings in order to fund the class action settlement escrow and our separation from Tyco International.
        Our effective income tax rate was 5.3% and 26.9% for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 includes a net release of $268 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in connection with improved profitability in certain jurisdictions, principally the U.S. Our U.S. results of operations in fiscal 2006 combined with other available evidence, including projections of future taxable income, indicated that it is more likely than not we will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future and accordingly the related valuation allowance was reduced. In addition to the valuation allowance release, effective tax rate was impacted by a $39 million state tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2006, primarily related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture, as well as $87 million of tax benefits associated with the receipt of a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling permitting the deduction of historical debt retirement costs. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2005 reflects the release of $129 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and $105 million of benefits recognized related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture, principally in the U.S.
        The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $703 million and $611 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "
Accounting for Income Taxes
," which requires a valuation allowance to be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.
        The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities and related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon eventual settlement with the tax authorities. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.
        Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts were distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.
(Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes
        Loss from discontinued operations was $376 million in fiscal 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, a plan was approved to divest our Power Systems business and, in connection with the approval, we recorded a $435 million after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge. As discussed above, subsequent to year end, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Power Systems business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we consummated the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.
        Loss from discontinued operations was $246 million in fiscal 2006 and income from discontinued operations was $154 million in fiscal 2005, reflecting the operating results of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Board businesses as well as a goodwill impairment of $316 million recorded during fiscal 2006 related to the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem reporting unit, which was a reporting unit in the Wireless Systems segment prior to reclassification to held for sale.
        See Note 5 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding discontinued operations.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change
        During fiscal 2006, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, "
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan interpretation of FASB No. 143
." Accordingly, we have recognized asset retirement obligations of $16 million and property, plant, and equipment, net of $4 million, of which $2 million and $1 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively, in our Combined Financial Statements at fiscal year end 2006. In addition, we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in an $8 million after-tax, $12 million pre-tax, loss. See Note 2 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on FIN 47.
        During fiscal 2005, we changed the measurement date for our pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. We believe that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, we recorded an $11 million after-tax, $13 million pre-tax, gain cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2005. See Note 15 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on retirement plans.
Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment
        Effective October 1, 2004, we changed our fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30th to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, so that each quarterly period would be 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will be 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. The impact of this change was not material to the Combined Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $21 million after-tax, $29 million pre-tax, and was reported within equity.
        The following table summarizes the sources of our cash flow from operating activities and the use of a portion of that cash in our operations for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005:
        Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2007 was $1,508 million compared to $1,624 million in fiscal 2006. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by a $163 million advance payment to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") related to shared tax liabilities. The net change in assets and liabilities was a cash decrease of $43 million. The components of this change are set forth in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows and include increases in inventory of $111 million offset by increases in accrued and other current liabilities of $103 million. Although overall inventory levels increased in fiscal 2007, we continued to make progress in reducing days of inventory on hand. Inventory days were 72 at September 28, 2007 compared to 75
at September 29, 2006. Increases in accrued and other current liabilities at fiscal year end 2007 resulted from our dividend payable and increased restructuring activity in fiscal 2007.
        We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending increased $356 million in fiscal 2007 to $875 million as compared to $519 million in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, we exercised our option to buy five cable-laying sea vessels that were previously leased to us and used by the Undersea Telecommunications segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure. Capital spending in fiscal 2007 also increased to support our increased sales activities. We expect long-term capital investment levels of approximately 4% to 5% of net sales each year.
        In fiscal 2007, we received $227 million in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business. Also, during fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the class action settlement escrow for $928 million. Related net class action settlement costs of $887 million were recognized in fiscal 2007.
        The amount of pension and postretirement benefit contributions reflected in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $71 million, $69 million, and $81 million, respectively. These amounts include voluntary pension contributions of $24 million in fiscal 2005. We anticipate pension contributions to be $70 million to $80 million per year on an ongoing basis before consideration of voluntary contributions.
        The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2007 was $450 million, including the $163 million related to the advance payment to the IRS for legacy tax liabilities.
Capitalization
        Total debt at September 28, 2007 was $3,378 million. At fiscal year end 2006, total debt was $3,662 million of which $3,510 million was due to Tyco International. The amount due to Tyco International represents the portion of Tyco International's consolidated debt that was proportionately allocated to us based on our historical funding requirements. We believe the debt allocation basis was reasonable based on our historical financing needs. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company nor do these amounts represent actual indebtedness owed to Tyco International.
        During September 2007, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $800 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $750 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $500 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us. TEGSA offered the senior notes in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. In addition, the initial purchasers, through their respective selling agents, sold less than one-half of one percent of the senior notes outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we and TEGSA entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers under which we and TEGSA agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes, to file with the SEC an exchange offer registration statement within 210 days after the date of the original issue of the notes. Net proceeds from the sales of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of borrowings under the unsecured senior bridge loan facility.
        In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a $2,800 million unsecured senior bridge loan facility. We are the guarantor of the bridge facility which had an original maturity date of April 23, 2008. On August 31, 2007, we and TEGSA amended the unsecured bridge loan facility to permit, at TEGSA's option, an extension of the maturity from April 23, 2008 to April 22, 2009. Borrowings under the bridge facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the
facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. The bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if we or TEGSA issue debt or equity. In May 2007, tranche B was added to the bridge facility, increasing the amount of the facility by $775 million. All balances under tranche B of the facility were paid off and all commitments under tranche B were cancelled in August 2007. Borrowings under the bridge facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's existing bank credit facilities, and to fund our portion of Tyco International's class action settlement escrow. See Note 16 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding the class action settlement.
        Additionally, in April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. We are the guarantor of the revolving credit facility. The commitments under the revolving credit facility are $1,500 million. Interest and fees under the revolving credit facility are substantially the same as under the bridge loan facility. The revolving credit facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes.
        As of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $700 million outstanding under the five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.38%. Also, as of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $550 million of indebtedness outstanding under the unsecured bridge loan facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.47%.
        During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we conducted a tender offer to purchase for cash our subsidiary's 7.2% notes due 2008 amounting to $86 million. Approximately $67 million, or 78%, of the notes were tendered and extinguished.
        Our debt agreements contain financial and other customary covenants. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 28, 2007, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
        The September 2007 senior notes referred to above are subject to an exchange and registration rights agreement under which if certain registration requirements are not met by the required time or registration is withdrawn or is subject to an effective stop order, there may be a registration default, requiring payment by us of liquidated damages in the form of special interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days of such registration default, and at a rate of 0.50% thereafter, until such registration default is cured. As of September 28, 2007, we have determined that the likelihood of a registration default is remote and have not accrued any special interest.
        In November 2007, TEGSA commenced issuing commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as part of our ongoing effort to enhance financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
        In September 2007, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share. The dividend was paid on November 9, 2007. Future dividends to holders of our common shares, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of Bermuda law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.
        In September 2007, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $750 million to purchase a portion of our outstanding common shares. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007.
        Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, the overall capacity and terms of our financing arrangements as discussed above, and access to the capital and money markets as well as other sources of funding. Given the volatility in the financial markets, we continue to monitor the markets closely and take steps to maintain financial flexibility and an appropriate capital structure.
        On September 19, 2005, we were awarded a contract to build and operate the statewide private radio system for the State of New York. Under the contractual terms, this is a 20-year contract that requires us to build the network and lease it to the State. As we build the network over the next five years, we will need to invest approximately $500 to $550 million. As of September 28, 2007, we have invested $28 million, primarily consisting of inventory. We expect that in fiscal 2008 we will invest approximately $50 to $75 million which will be funded by cash generated from operations.
        The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payments obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2007.
(1)
Excludes interest.
(2)
Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services.
(3)
Total contractual cash obligations in the table above exclude pension and postretirement benefit obligations, income taxes, and other long-term liabilities.
We have pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $73 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2008 and $70 million to $80 million per year on an ongoing basis, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report.
Income taxes and other long-term liabilities are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items.
        At September 28, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $277 million.
        At September 28, 2007, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems segment. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency currently is not estimable.
Income Tax Matters
        Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. We and Tyco International are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable and which relate specifically to the Tyco Electronics business have been recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to the electronics businesses as a result of the tax liability sharing arrangements with Tyco International and Covidien entered into upon Separation.
        In fiscal 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the fiscal 1997 through 2000 years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006, Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through fiscal 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. These adjustments resulted in a $205 million net decrease in deferred income tax assets and a $205 million decrease in income taxes in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
        During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International completed proposed amendments to a portion of its U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2001 through 2005 fiscal periods, which primarily reflected the roll forward of the previous amendments for the 1997 to 2002 fiscal periods. These adjustments resulted in a $9 million increase to the tax provision on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in fiscal 2007. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2002. When our tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
        During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents' Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The Revenue Agents' Reports propose tax audit adjustments to certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, we have made no additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to our share of the proposed audit adjustments in the Revenue Agents' Reports.
        Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to Tyco International of $458 million, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International paid $458 million. Our portion of this payment reduced income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by $163 million. Currently, it is our understanding that Tyco International will appeal other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could result in Tyco International filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years
subsequent to the current fiscal 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future reporting periods.
        Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, we estimate the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Currently, it is our understanding that Tyco International will vigorously oppose the assertion of any such penalties.
        In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.
        Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of all liabilities settled by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.
        Upon Separation, $930 million of Tyco International's contingent tax liabilities related to unresolved tax matters were transferred to us in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, we recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien of $675 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2007 relating to indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, an analysis of the tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien indicated that we are the primary obligor for an additional $161 million of tax and related interest for which reserves had been recorded on the books of Tyco International and Covidien. Accordingly, the amounts recorded by us upon Separation for contingent tax liabilities and the corresponding assets for indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien were increased to reflect these additional amounts. The initial liability at Separation and the adjustment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
        Our contractual obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement is 31% of legacy Tyco International contingent tax liabilities, or $675 million. This net obligation is comprised of shared contingent tax liabilities of $1,223 million, adjusted for the contractual obligations among the parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement. These contractual obligations consist of a $844 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien related to our shared contingent tax liabilities, a $198 million liability applicable to Tyco International and Covidien contingent tax liabilities, and a $98 million liability under FIN 45, "
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,
" related to the estimated fair value of future indemnifications made under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See further discussion in Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under this agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the
unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information regarding our responsibility for contingent tax liabilities.
Legal Matters
        In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007 and Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding legal proceedings.
        Prior to the announcement of the planned separation in January 2006, Tyco International and certain former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class action, shareholder lawsuits, and ERISA related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation have been allocated among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of the pending litigation. If Tyco International or Covidien were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International will manage and control all the legal matters related to assumed contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these class actions are set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Tyco Electronics, and Covidien.
        Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third-parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2008 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 16 Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for a discussion of these liabilities.
        At September 29, 2006, we had an off-balance sheet leasing arrangement for five cable laying sea vessels. Upon expiration of this lease in October 2006, we exercised our option to buy these vessels for $280 million and, accordingly, the residual guarantee of $54 million was settled.
        In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of all liabilities settled by us with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in accordance with FIN 45, "
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
," and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $98 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. See Notes 13 and 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information.
        We record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding estimated product warranty.
        The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.
Revenue Recognition
        Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101, "
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,
" and SAB No. 104, "
Revenue Recognition
," as issued by the SEC and other applicable guidance.
        Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass. This time is generally when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.
        Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to completion. Cost to completion is measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments.
Inventories
        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
        Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 3 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors, and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since management's judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated.
        When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in SFAS No. 142, "
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
." First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
        Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analysis. These approaches incorporate many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.
Income Taxes
        In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
        In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
        We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such allowance may affect goodwill rather than the income tax provision.
        Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
        In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities as well as related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year.
Pension and Postretirement Benefit
        Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and turnover and are evaluated periodically
and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by $106.3 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $101.6 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by $9.8 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $9.8 million.
Share-Based Compensation
        We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "
Share-Based Payment
," on October 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Under SFAS No. 123R, we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected stock price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of the Company's stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
        In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)
." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We currently use a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The measurement date provisions will become effective for us in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact of the measurement date change provision on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We adopted the funded status recognition provisions at September 28, 2007. The incremental effects of adopting the standard on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are increases of $386 million in long-term pension and postretirement benefit liabilities, $16 million in accrued and other current liabilities, and $55 million in other assets. The impact of adoption also resulted in additional net deferred tax assets of $122 million. The impact of adoption to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of equity, was a reduction of $225 million. There was no impact on pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefits plans in fiscal 2007. On-going compliance with the standard will not impact pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefit plans. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion of the implementation of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158.
        In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, "
Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements
." SAB No. 108 provides guidance on evaluating the materiality of prior periods' misstatements, quantifying the effects of correcting misstatements in the current period and criteria for restatement of prior periods. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We adopted this guidance effective for fiscal 2007. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
        In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, "
Business Combinations
." SFAS No. 141R replaces SFAS No. 141 and addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations.

Exhibit 99.3
ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
To the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Board of Directors:
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006 and the related consolidated and combined statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007. Our audits also included the accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and combined financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
        In our opinion, such consolidated and combined financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated and combined financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated and combined financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
        As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, prior to its separation from Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"), the Company was comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International. The combined financial statements also included allocations of corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, other expenses, debt and related interest expense from Tyco International. These allocations may not be reflective of the actual level of costs or debt which would have been incurred had the Company operated as a separate entity apart from Tyco International.
        As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2007, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).
        As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in connection with its separation from Tyco International, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments with Tyco International and Covidien Ltd. and has recorded the fair value of these guarantees.
        As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
Share-Based Payment
.
        As discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, in fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date of its pension and post retirement plans from September 30 to August 31.
        As discussed in Note 26 to the consolidated and combined financial statements, the accompanying 2007, 2006 and 2005 consolidated and combined financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for discontinued operations.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania December 14, 2007 (June 27, 2008 as to Note 26)
1. Separation and Basis of Presentation
The Separation
        Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company"), a company organized under the laws of Bermuda, became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation").
Basis of Presentation
        The accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded company as of and subsequent to June 29, 2007 and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for periods prior to June 29, 2007.
        The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant estimates in these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, acquisition liabilities, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of future cash flows associated with asset impairments, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, loss contingencies, net realizable value of inventories, estimated contract revenue and related costs, legal liabilities, tax reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and postretirement employee benefit expenses. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
        The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of the Company's future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had it operated as an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented, including changes in the Company's capitalization as a result of the Separation from Tyco International. To the extent that an asset, liability, revenue, or expense is directly associated with the Company, it is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, and other expenses as well as debt and related net interest expense for periods prior to the Separation have been allocated by Tyco International to the Company. Management believes such allocations were reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual results of the Company had the Company been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented. See Note 17 for further information regarding allocated expenses.
Description of the Business
        The Company consists of four reportable segments:
 - 
Electronic Components.
    The Electronic Components segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of passive electronic components, which includes connectors and interconnect systems, relays, switches, circuit protection devices, touchscreens, sensors, and wire and cable. The
products sold by the Electronic Components segment are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and their contract manufacturers in the automotive, computer, consumer electronics, communication equipment, appliance, aerospace and defense, industrial machinery, and instrumentation markets.
 - 
Network Solutions.
    The Network Solutions segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of infrastructure components and systems for telecommunications and energy markets. These components include connectors, above- and below-ground enclosures, heat shrink tubing, cable accessories, surge arrestors, fiber optic cabling, copper cabling, and racks for copper and fiber networks. This segment also provides electronic systems for test access and intelligent cross-connect applications as well as integrated cabling solutions for cabling and building management.
 - 
Undersea Telecommunications.
    The Undersea Telecommunications segment designs, builds, maintains, and tests undersea fiber optic networks for both the telecommunications and oil and gas markets.
 - 
Wireless Systems.
    The Wireless Systems segment is an innovator of wireless technology for critical communications systems. This segment provides state-of-the-art two-way land mobile radio technology products and systems, including network and system infrastructure, portable radios, service, and maintenance. These systems are used primarily by public safety and government organizations.
Principles of Consolidation
        The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares or otherwise has the ability to control through similar rights. In addition, the Company consolidates variable interest entities in which the Company bears a majority of the risk to the entities' expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of the entities' expected returns. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Change in Fiscal Year and Reporting Calendar Alignment
        Unless otherwise indicated, references in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements to fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005 are to Tyco Electronics' fiscal years ended September 28, 2007, September 29, 2006, and September 30, 2005. Effective October 1, 2004, Tyco Electronics changed its fiscal year end from a calendar fiscal year ending September 30th to a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of September, such that each quarterly period is 13 weeks in length. For fiscal years in which there are 53 weeks, the fourth quarter reporting period will include 14 weeks, with the first such occurrence taking place in fiscal 2011. The impact of this change was not material to the Combined Financial Statements. Net income for the transition period related to this change was $21 million after-tax, $29 million pre-tax, and was reported within equity.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
        The Company's revenues are generated principally from the sale of its products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This is generally when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, the Company has deferred the recognition of revenue.
        The Company provides certain distributors with an inventory allowance for returns or scrap equal to a percentage of qualified purchases. A reserve for estimated scrap and returns allowances is established at the time of the sale based on a fixed percentage of sales to distributors authorized and agreed to by the Company and is recorded as a reduction of sales.
        Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. The Company believes it can reasonably and reliably estimate the amounts of future allowances.
        Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual cost incurred to total estimated cost. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within the Company's Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments.
        The Company typically warrants that its products will conform to the Company's specifications and that its products will be free from material defects in materials and manufacturing. The Company limits its liability to the replacement of defective parts or the cash value of replacement parts. The Company accepts returned goods only when the customer makes a claim and management has authorized the return. Returns result primarily from defective products or shipping discrepancies. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales.
        Additionally, certain of the Company's long-term contracts in its Wireless Systems and Undersea Telecommunications segments have warranty obligations. Estimated warranty costs for each contract are determined based on the contract terms and technology specific considerations. These costs are included in total estimated contract costs and are accrued over the construction period of the respective contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting.
        On September 26, 2005, the Company's Wireless Systems segment entered into a twenty year lease contract with the State of New York to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders worth $2 billion. Lease terms and payment streams begin when each of the regional networks that make up the statewide network are determined to meet the operational requirements of the contract and are accepted by the State of New York, with the lease terms running through September 2025.
        The Company is accounting for each regional network as a stand-alone sales-type lease and will recognize seller's profit on acceptance of each region. As of fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, no acceptance events have occurred with any region and therefore the Company has not recognized any revenue on the construction of the network. Costs totaling $28 million and $8 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, associated with the development and construction of the statewide wireless network, including interest expense incurred to finance the construction, have been capitalized primarily as inventories on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. No costs were incurred in fiscal 2005.
Research and Development
        Research and development expenditures are expensed when incurred and are included in cost of sales. Research and development expenses include salaries, direct costs incurred, and building and overhead expenses. The amounts expensed in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $482 million, $428 million, and $387 million, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
        All highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
        The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company's outstanding receivables determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts, and other currently available evidence.
Inventories
        Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value.
Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net and Long-Lived Assets
        Property, plant, and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
        The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment, and amortizable intangible assets, relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. An impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value.
The amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
        Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 3 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line basis. See Note 10 for additional information regarding intangible assets. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. The Company assesses intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with its policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever the Company believes a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
        As of fiscal year end 2007, the Company has 14 reporting units, of which 13 contain goodwill that is assessed for impairment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more operating segments or reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values.
        When testing for goodwill impairment, the Company performs a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, the Company compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, the Company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. The Company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
        Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by other valuation approaches, such as similar transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods.
Income Taxes
        Income taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "
Accounting for Income Taxes
." In these Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, the benefits of a consolidated return have been reflected where such returns have or could be filed based on the entities and jurisdictions included in the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities and operating loss carryforwards using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Financial Instruments
        In order to address certain financial exposures, the Company recently adopted a risk management program that includes the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. The Company has established policies regarding the types and notional value of derivative financial instruments that can be entered into. The Company currently enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and has designated certain intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies as a hedging of its net investments in certain foreign operations denominated in the same foreign currencies.
        All derivative financial instruments are reported on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations because the Company has not designated the derivatives as either a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge. The remeasurement of the intercompany non-derivative financial instruments designated as a hedge of the company's net investment in foreign operations is recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the Company's net investments in certain foreign operations.
        The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments by using methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date. For the majority of financial instruments, including derivatives, standard market conventions are used to determine fair value. For financial instruments that cannot be valued by means of standard market conventions, valuations are obtained from third-party financial institutions known to be active and significant participants in the relevant market.
        During fiscal 2007, in anticipation of issuing new fixed rate debt, the Company entered into, and concurrent with the Company's fixed rate debt issuance, terminated, forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest expense that would result from changes in interest rates between the date of the swap and the Company's anticipated date of issuing the fixed rate debt. These forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as effective hedges of the probable interest payments under SFAS No. 133, "
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
." See Note 14 for further information.
Share-Based Compensation
        The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, "
Share-Based Payment
," on October 1, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company determines the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. That fair value is expensed ratably over the expected service period, with an allowance made for estimated forfeitures based on historical employee activity. See Note 23 for additional information related to the Company's share-based compensation.
Share Premium and Contributed Surplus
        In accordance with the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, when the Company issues shares for cash at a premium to their par value, the resulting premium is credited to a share premium account, a non-distributable reserve. Contributed surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a distributable reserve.
Currency Translation
        For the Company's non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity.
        Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, which are included in net income, were immaterial in all periods presented.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change
        During fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, "
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligationsan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.
" Accordingly, the Company recognized asset retirement obligations of $16 million and property, plant, and equipment, net of $4 million, of which $2 million and $1 million are reflected in liabilities and assets of discontinued operations, respectively, in its Combined Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2006. In addition, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change which resulted in an $8 million after-tax, $12 million pre-tax, loss.
        During fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. As a result of this change, the Company recorded an $11 million after-tax, $13 million pre-tax, gain cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal 2005. See Note 15 for additional information on the Company's retirement plans.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
        In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)
." SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. The Company currently uses a measurement date of August 31st. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The measurement date provisions will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2009. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the measurement date change provisions on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The Company adopted the funded status recognition provisions at September 28, 2007. The incremental effects of adopting the standard on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are increases of $386 million in long-term pension and postretirement benefit liabilities, $16 million in accrued and other current liabilities, and $55 million in other assets. The impact of adoption also resulted in additional net deferred tax assets of $122 million. The impact of adoption to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of equity, was a reduction of $225 million. There was no impact on pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefits plans in fiscal 2007. On-going compliance with the standard will not impact pension or other postretirement benefit expense, cash flows, or benefit plans. See Note 15 for further discussion of the implementation of the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158.
        In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 108, "
Considering the Effect of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.
" SAB No. 108 provides guidance on evaluating the materiality of prior periods' misstatements, quantifying the effects of correcting misstatements in the current period and criteria for restatement of prior periods. SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company adopted this guidance effective for fiscal 2007. This adoption did not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
        In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, "
Business Combinations
." SFAS No. 141R replaces SFAS No. 141 and addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The Company is currently assessing the impact that SFAS No. 141R will have on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
        In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "

        In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
" SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract-by-contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

        In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
." This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 and related interpretations are effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effect of adoption will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for fiscal 2008. The Company is currently assessing the expected impact of adopting FIN 48. Based upon its evaluation to date, the Company estimates that the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings will be $100 to $200 million. This adjustment includes an estimated net increase in contingent liabilities upon adoption of FIN 48 of $300 to $400 million, excluding interest, reduced by the portion of these contingent liabilities for which Tyco International and Covidien are contractually obligated under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 17 for additional information regarding responsibilities for unresolved legacy tax matters.
3. Separation Costs
        In connection with the Separation, the Company incurred costs of $44 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including non-cash compensation expense of $11 million related to the modification of share option awards at Separation and $12 million related to the acceleration of restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards and the acceleration of restricted share award vesting.

Fiscal 2007 Actions
        The Company initiated restructuring programs during fiscal 2007 relating to the exit of manufacturing operations and the migration of product lines to low cost countries in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments and the rationalization of certain product lines in the Wireless Systems segment. In connection with these actions, during fiscal 2007, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $69 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. The Company expects to complete all restructuring activities commenced in fiscal 2007 by the end of fiscal 2009 and to incur additional charges of approximately $26 million relating to these initiated actions by completion.
Fiscal 2006 Actions
        During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $10 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. These charges included the elimination of 101 positions. As of fiscal year end 2007, all actions under these plans are complete.

5. Discontinued Operations and Divestitures
Discontinued Operations
        In March 2008, the Company was authorized by its board of directors to pursue the divestiture of its Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business, and in May 2008, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business. See Note 26 for additional information.
        The divestiture of the Company's Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, the Company assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment under SFAS No. 144, "
Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
," using a probability-weighted set of expected cash flows from the eventual disposition. The Company determined that the book value of the Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a $435 million after-tax, $585 million pre-tax, impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Power Systems business. See Note 26 for additional information.
        During fiscal 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to divest the Printed Circuit Group business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company consummated the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale.
        The Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented. Prior to reclassification to held for sale, the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business was a component of the Wireless Systems segment. Both the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group business were components of the Other segment, which has been renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment.
        The following table reflects net sales, pre-tax (loss) income from discontinued operations, pre-tax gain on sale of discontinued operations including impairments and costs to sell, and income taxes for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005:
        The following table presents balance sheet information for discontinued operations and other businesses held for sale at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006:
Gain on Divestiture
        During fiscal 2005, the Company agreed to sell the Tyco Global Network, its undersea fiber optic telecommunication network that was part of the Undersea Telecommunications segment. The sale was consummated on June 30, 2005. As part of the sale transaction, the Company received gross cash proceeds of $130 million and the purchaser assumed certain liabilities. In connection with this sale, the Company recorded a $301 million pre-tax gain which is reflected in gain on divestiture in the Combined Statement of Operations for fiscal 2005. The Company has presented the operations of the Tyco Global Network in continuing operations as the criteria for discontinued operations were not met.
6. Acquisitions
Acquisitions
        During fiscal 2006, the Company acquired one business for an aggregate cost of $18 million and acquired the remaining interest in a joint venture for $5 million. The Company acquired one business for an aggregate cost of $8 million and acquired the remaining interest in a joint venture for $4 million in fiscal 2005. These acquisitions were funded utilizing cash generated from operations. These acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Holdback and Earn-Out Liabilities
        The Company paid cash related to holdback and earn-out liabilities of approximately $1 million, $82 million, and $2 million during fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, relating to certain prior period acquisitions. The total cash paid in fiscal 2006 was reported in discontinued operations as it related to the Printed Circuit Group business. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other pre-acquisition contingencies. Additionally, certain acquisitions have provisions that would require the Company to make additional contingent purchase price payments to the sellers if the acquired company achieves certain milestones subsequent to its acquisition by the Company. These payments are tied to certain performance measures, such as sales, gross margin, or earnings growth and generally are treated as additional purchase price.
        At fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, holdback and earn-out liabilities of $59 million and $53 million, respectively, were included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets.
7. Inventories
        At fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, inventories consisted of the following:
8. Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net
        At fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, property, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following:
        Depreciation expense was $480 million, $426 million, and $431 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
        Capital leases are included as a component of machinery and equipment. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.
        During fiscal 2007, the Company exercised its option to buy five cable-laying sea vessels that were previously leased to the Company and used by the Undersea Telecommunications segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure.
9. Goodwill
        The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for fiscal 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
        During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $316 million in (loss) income from discontinued operations related to the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem reporting unit, which was a reporting unit in the Wireless Systems segment prior to being reclassified to held for sale. The impairment charge was incurred when the reporting unit experienced slower growth and profitability than management's previous experience and future expectations due to sales declines in certain end markets.
10. Intangible Assets, Net
        The Company's intangible assets at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
        Intangible asset amortization expense, which is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses, was $34 million, $33 million, and $30 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense on intangible assets currently owned by the Company is expected to be as follows:
11. Accrued and Other Current Liabilities
        At fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, accrued and other current liabilities consisted of the following:
12. Debt
        Debt at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 was as follows:
(1)
The current portion of long-term debt at September 28, 2007 was comprised of $5 million of the amount shown as other. At September 29, 2006, the current portion of long-term debt was comprised of $285 million due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates and $6 million of the amount shown as other.
        During September 2007, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, issued $800 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $750 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $500 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037, all of which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. TEGSA offered the senior notes in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). In addition, the initial purchasers, through their respective selling agents, sold less than one-half of one percent of the senior notes outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, TEGSA and the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers under which TEGSA and the Company agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the senior notes, to file with the SEC an exchange offer registration statement within 210 days after the date of the original issue of the notes. Net proceeds from the sales of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of borrowings under the unsecured senior bridge loan facility.
        In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a $2,800 million unsecured senior bridge loan facility. The Company is the guarantor of the bridge facility which had an original maturity date of April 23, 2008. On August 31, 2007, the Company and TEGSA amended the unsecured bridge loan facility to permit, at TEGSA's option, an extension of the maturity from April 23, 2008 to April 22, 2009. Borrowings under the bridge facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. The bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if the Company or TEGSA issues debt or equity. In May 2007, tranche B was added to the bridge facility, increasing the amount of the facility by $775 million. All balances under tranche B of the facility were paid off and all commitments under tranche B were cancelled in August 2007. Borrowings under the bridge facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco International's debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco International's existing
bank credit facilities, and to fund the Company's portion of Tyco International's class action settlement escrow. See Note 16 for further information regarding the class action settlement.
        Additionally, in April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The Company is the guarantor of the revolving credit facility. The commitments under the revolving credit facility are $1,500 million. Interest and fees under the revolving credit facility are substantially the same as under the bridge loan facility. The revolving credit facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes.
        As of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $700 million outstanding under the five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.38%. Also, as of September 28, 2007, TEGSA had $550 million of indebtedness outstanding under the unsecured bridge loan facility, which bore interest at the rate of 5.47%.
        During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company conducted a tender offer to purchase for cash its subsidiary's 7.2% notes due 2008 amounting to $86 million. Approximately $67 million, or 78%, of the notes were tendered and extinguished.
        The Company's debt agreements contain financial and other customary covenants. None of these covenants are presently considered restrictive to the Company's operations. As of September 28, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
        The September 2007 senior notes referred to above are subject to an exchange and registration rights agreement under which if certain registration requirements are not met by the required time or registration is withdrawn or is subject to an effective stop order, there may be a registration default, requiring payment by the Company of liquidated damages in the form of special interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days of such registration default, and at a rate of 0.50% thereafter, until such registration default is cured. As of September 28, 2007, the Company has determined that the likelihood of a registration default is remote and has not accrued any special interest.
        Tyco International's consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by the Company, was proportionately allocated to the Company at September 29, 2006 based on the historical funding requirements of the Company using historical data. The allocated debt amounts, presented as "Due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates," were classified on the Combined Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006 based on the maturities of Tyco International's underlying debt.
        Net interest expense was allocated in the same proportions as debt through June 1, 2007 and includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. For fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, Tyco International has allocated to Tyco Electronics interest expense of $150 million, $234 million, and $271 million, respectively, and interest income of $20 million, $33 million, and $32 million, respectively.
        In addition, Tyco International has allocated to the Company loss on retirement of debt in the amount of $232 million and $365 million for fiscal 2007 and 2005, respectively. Such amounts are included in other expense, net in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. The method utilized to allocate loss on retirement of debt is consistent with the allocation of debt and net interest expense as described above.
        Management believes the allocation basis for debt, net interest expense, and loss on retirement of debt was reasonable based on the historical financing needs of the Company. However, these amounts
may not be indicative of the actual amounts that the Company would have incurred had it been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the periods presented.
        The fair value of the Company's debt was approximately $3,413 million at fiscal year end 2007. At fiscal year end 2006, the fair value of the Company's external debt, which excludes amounts allocated by Tyco International, was approximately $155 million. For further detail of methods and assumptions used in determining fair value, see Note 2.
        The aggregate amounts of total debt, maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
        The unsecured senior bridge loan facility of $550 million is classified as long-term as a result of the Company's August 31, 2007 amendment to the facility. On the maturity schedule above, the $550 million is presented as maturing in fiscal 2008.
        Certain of the Company's operating subsidiaries have overdraft or similar types of facilities, which totaled $50 million, of which $46 million was undrawn and available at fiscal year end 2007. These facilities, most of which are renewable, expire at various dates through the year 2010 and are established primarily within the Company's international operations.
13. Guarantees
        Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all liabilities settled by the Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.
        The Company's indemnification created under the Tax Sharing Agreement qualifies as a guarantee of a third party entity's debt under FIN 45, "
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others
." FIN 45 addresses the measurement and disclosure of a guarantor's obligation to pay a debt incurred by a third party. To value the initial obligation under FIN 45, the Company considered a range of probability-weighted future cash flows that represent the likelihood of payment of each class of liability by each of the three post-Separation
companies. The future cash flows incorporate interest and penalties that the companies believe will be incurred on each class of liabilities and are discounted to the present value to reflect the value associated with each as of September 28, 2007. The FIN 45 calculation includes a premium that reflects the cost for an insurance carrier to stand in and assume the payment obligation. Because the future cash flows include a consideration of all tax positions, both asserted and unasserted, the FIN 45 fair value is reduced by the Company's accrual of 31% of all asserted tax liabilities on the books of Tyco International and Covidien.
        Based on the probability-weighted future cash flows related to the unresolved tax matters, the Company, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, faces a maximum potential liability of $3 billion, based on undiscounted estimates and interest and penalties used to determine the fair value of the FIN 45 guarantee and an assumption of 100% default on the parts of Tyco International and Covidien, a likelihood that management believes to be remote. In the event that the Company is required, due to bankruptcy or other business interruption on the part of Tyco International or Covidien, to pay more than the contractually determined 31%, the Company retains the right to seek payment from the effected entity.
        At Separation, the probability-weighted cash flows and risk premium resulted in a fair value of the FIN 45 liability of $338 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, a review of tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien resulted in approximately $134 million of tax reserves on the books of Tyco International and Covidien being transferred to the Company. As a result of recording those liabilities, the Company re-assessed its FIN 45 liability and decreased it by $42 million to $296 million. The total liability of $296 million under FIN 45 consists of two components. The first component is a SFAS No. 5, "
Accounting for Contingencies
," liability that represents the asserted liabilities that either Tyco International or Covidien have determined to be probable and estimable totaling $198 million. The remaining $98 million represents the fair value of the 31% indemnification made to Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The initial liability at Separation and the transfer made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
        Upon Separation, the Company assumed $930 million of contingent tax liabilities from Tyco International which was recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, these liabilities, coupled with pre-existing tax liabilities, resulted in the Company recording a receivable of $675 million from Tyco International and Covidien to reflect the 69% indemnification granted by each, which was recorded in receivable from Tyco International Ltd. and Covidien Ltd. on the Consolidated Balance Sheet upon Separation. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, in conjunction with the review of tax reserves discussed in the above paragraph, the Company assumed an additional $161 million in tax reserves, of which $27 million represents accrued interest, resulting in total income tax liabilities assumed as a result of Separation of $1,091 million, which is recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of assuming these liabilities, the Company has recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in the amount of $844 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
        In disposing of assets or businesses, the Company often provides representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. The Company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
However, the Company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        The Company generally records estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. For further information on estimated product warranty see Note 2.
        The changes in the Company's warranty liability for fiscal 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
14. Financial Instruments
        The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, debt, and derivative financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, external debt, and derivative financial instruments approximated book value at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006. See Note 12 for the fair value estimates of external debt.
        To the extent that Tyco International entered into hedges on behalf of the Company prior to Separation, the statement of operations effects of those hedges have been allocated to the Company as part of the Tyco International general corporate overhead expense allocation or interest expense allocation as appropriate. See Note 17.
        The cash flows related to derivative financial instruments are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flow.
Foreign Exchange Risks
        As permitted under the Company's risk management program and policies, the Company uses derivative and non-derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency risks.
        As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company utilizes foreign exchange forwards and swaps. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and forecasted cash transactions. These contracts are marked to market with changes in the derivatives fair value recognized currently in earnings in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had net liabilities of $8 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to these transactions.
        The Company centrally manages the cash of most of its subsidiaries. To convert foreign currency cash flows in a cost effective manner, the Company enters into currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards. The terms of these instruments are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are largely offsetting and are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.
Interest Rate Risk Management
        The Company issues debt, from time to time, in capital markets to fund its operations. Such borrowings can result in interest rate and/or currency exposure. To manage these exposures and to minimize overall interest cost, the Company has used and may use in the future interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable rate debt (fair value hedges) and/or convert a portion of its variable rate debt into fixed rate debt (cash flow hedges). At the end of September 28, 2007, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swaps.
        During fiscal 2007, in anticipation of issuing new fixed rate debt, the Company entered into, and concurrent with the Company's fixed rate debt issuance, terminated, forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest expense that would result from changes in interest rates between the date of the swap and the Company's anticipated date of issuing fixed rate debt. These forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as effective hedges of the probable interest payments under SFAS No. 133. Upon the issuance of the Company's new debt, these swaps were terminated for a cash payment of $54 million. The effective portion of these swaps of $53 million was recorded in other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings as interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instruments. The ineffective portion of $1 million was recorded as interest expense in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Hedge of Net Investment
        The Company hedges its net investments in certain foreign operations using intercompany non-derivative financial instruments denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was $3.7 billion at September 28, 2007. As a result of the hedges of net investment, $118 million of foreign exchange loss was reclassified to cumulative translation adjustment, a component of other comprehensive income, for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007. The Company did not hedge net investments in foreign operations during fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005.
        The Company's derivative financial instruments present certain market and counterparty risks; however, concentration of counterparty risk is mitigated as the Company deals with a variety of major banks worldwide with long-term Standard & Poor's and Moody's credit ratings of A/A2 or higher. In addition, only conventional derivative financial instruments are utilized, thereby affording optimum clarity as to the determination of the market risk. None of the Company's derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to the Company if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, the Company does not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments.
15. Retirement Plans
Measurement Date
        In fiscal 2005, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans from September 30th to August 31st, effective October 1, 2004. The Company believes that the one-month change of measurement date was a preferable change as it allows management adequate time to evaluate and report the actuarial information in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under the accelerated reporting deadlines. Accordingly, all amounts presented as of and for the fiscal years ended 2006 and 2005 reflect an August 31st measurement date, while prior years reflect a September 30th measurement date. The Company has accounted for the change in measurement date as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of the accounting principle change as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 was an $11 million after-tax, $13 million pre-tax, gain. The change in measurement date did not have a material effect on net periodic benefit costs.
Adoption of SFAS No. 158
        As disclosed in Note 2, the Company adopted the funded status recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective September 28, 2007. The following table summarizes the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007:
        The amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 28, 2007 were as follows:
        The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of September 28, 2007 that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) during fiscal 2008 were as follows:
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
        Prior to Separation, the Company participated through its former parent, Tyco International, in a number of contributory and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans. Subsequent to Separation, the Company assumed sponsorship of those plans, covering certain of its U.S. and non-U.S. employees, designed in accordance with local custom and practice. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on periodic actuarial valuations which use the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Contribution amounts are determined based on the advice of professionally qualified actuaries in the countries concerned. The benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation.
        Prior to Separation, the Company participated through its former parent in one co-mingled plan that included plan participants of other Tyco International subsidiaries. The Company recorded its portion of the co-mingled plan's expense and the related obligation, which has been actuarially determined based on the Company's specific benefit formulas by participants and allocated plan assets. The contribution amounts were determined in total for the co-mingled plan and allocated to the Company based on headcount. Management believes such allocations were reasonable. In fiscal 2007, this plan was legally separated, resulting in a reallocation of assets based on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") prescribed calculation which will result in adjustments to the components of the net amount recognized and future expense.
        The net periodic benefit (credit) cost for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was as follows:
        The following table represents the changes in benefit obligations, plan assets, and the net amount recognized on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets for all U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006:
        In determining the expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by their external advisors.
        The investment strategy for the U.S. pension plans has been governed by the Company's Investment Committee; investment strategies for non-U.S. pension plans are governed locally. The Company's investment strategy for its pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants.
        Target weighted-average asset allocations and weighted average asset allocations for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
        Tyco Electronics' common shares are not a direct investment of the Company's pension funds; however, the pension funds may indirectly include Tyco Electronics shares. The aggregate amount of the Tyco Electronics common shares would not be considered material relative to the total pension fund assets.
        The Company's funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with the laws and customs of the various countries in which it operates as well as to make discretionary voluntary contributions from time-to-time. The Company anticipates that, at a minimum, it will make the minimum required contributions to its pension plans in fiscal 2008 of $4 million for U.S. plans and $66 million for non-U.S. plans.
        Benefit payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:
        The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and non-U.S. plans as of fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 was as follows:
        The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
        The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 were as follows:
Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
        The Company maintains several defined contribution retirement plans, which include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants' compensation and was $72 million, $69 million, and $68 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plans
        The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to a number of funds in Tyco Electronics' 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. Total deferred compensation liabilities were $37 million and $27 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $5 million and $4 million were included in liabilities held for sale, respectively. Deferred compensation expense was immaterial in all years presented.
Rabbi Trusts
        The Company has established rabbi trusts, related to certain acquired companies, through which the assets may be used to pay non-qualified plan benefits. The trusts primarily hold bonds. The rabbi trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency. The value of the assets held by these trusts, included in Other assets on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets, was $89 million and $87 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total liabilities related to the assets held by the rabbi trust and reflected on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet were $25 million and $28 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Plan participants are general creditors of the Company with respect to these benefits.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
        In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, the Company also provides certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from date of retirement to age 65.
        Net periodic postretirement benefit cost in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was as follows:
        The components of the accrued postretirement benefit obligations, substantially all of which are unfunded, at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, were as follows:
        The Company expects to make contributions to its postretirement benefit plans of $3 million in fiscal 2008.
        Benefit payments, including those amounts to be paid out of corporate assets and reflecting future expected service as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:
        Health care cost trend assumptions are as follows:
        A one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:
16. Commitments and Contingencies
        The Company has facility, land, vehicle, and equipment leases that expire at various dates through the year 2056. Rental expense under these leases was $165 million, $158 million, and $182 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. At fiscal year end 2007, the minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable lease obligations were as follows:
        The Company also has purchase obligations related to commitments to purchase certain goods and services. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had commitments to spend $92 million in fiscal 2008.
        At fiscal year end 2007, the Company also had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems segment. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as the outcome of this contingency currently is not estimable.
        In the normal course of business, the Company is liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
        As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into upon Separation, any existing or potential liabilities related to Tyco International's outstanding litigation were assigned to the Company if Tyco Electronics was specifically identified in the lawsuit. However, any existing or potential liabilities that could not be associated with Tyco Electronics were allocated appropriately and post-separation sharing agreements were established. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a description of Tyco International's various significant outstanding litigation proceedings. Tyco Electronics will be responsible for certain potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of the pending litigation based on the post-separation sharing agreement. If Tyco International or Covidien
were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, the Company would be required to pay additional amounts.
Class Actions
        As a result of actions taken by certain of Tyco International's former senior corporate management, Tyco International, some members of Tyco International's former senior corporate management, former members of Tyco International's board of directors, Tyco International's former General Counsels and former Chief Financial Officer, and Tyco International's current Chief Executive Officer are named defendants in a number of purported class actions alleging violations of the disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws. Tyco International, certain of its current and former employees, some members of its former senior corporate management, and some former members of its board of directors also are named as defendants in several ERISA class actions. Tyco International is generally obligated to indemnify its directors and officers and its former directors and officers who are named as defendants in some or all of these matters to the extent required by Bermuda law. In addition, Tyco International's insurance carriers may decline coverage, or Tyco International's coverage may be insufficient to cover its expenses and liability, in some or all of these matters.
        On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs' counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 purported securities class action lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding does not resolve all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims arising under ERISA.
        Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants, and ten other individuals in consideration for the payment of $2,975 million from Tyco International to the certified class and assignment to the class of any net recovery of any claims possessed by Tyco International and the other settling defendants against Tyco International's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Defendant PricewaterhouseCoopers was not a settling defendant and is not a party to the memorandum. However, PricewaterhouseCoopers subsequently agreed to participate in the settlement as a settling defendant, and in consideration of a release of all claims against it by the parties to the memorandum of understanding, agreed to make a payment of $225 million. Tyco International and the other settling defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing and legal liability arising from any of the facts or conduct alleged in the actions. The parties to the memorandum of understanding applied to the court for approval of the settlement agreement. On July 13, 2007, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On November 2, 2007, the final fairness hearing for the class settlement was held, and the court indicated it would approve the settlement and stated a formal ruling would be issued shortly. If the settlement agreement does not receive final court approval, the memorandum of understanding will be null and void. By December 28, 2007, class participants must file their proofs of claim demonstrating their right to recovery under the class settlement.
        Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement that was entered into in connection with the Separation, Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability and related escrow account with Tyco International assuming 27%, Covidien 42%, and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total settlement amount.
        In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, the Company was
allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers, of which $31 million has been collected. The net charge of $887 million has been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as allocated class action settlement costs, net. The portions allocated to the Company are consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class. In addition, interest is accrued on the class action settlement liability. At fiscal year end 2007, the Company recorded $928 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for its portion of the escrow. In addition, the Company recorded a $2,992 million liability and a $2,064 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien for their portion of the liability at fiscal year end 2007.
        If the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved proceedings were to be determined adversely to Tyco International, the Company's share of any additional potential losses, which are not presently estimable, may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Investigations
        Tyco International and others have received various subpoenas and requests from the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the U.S. Department of Labor, the General Service Administration, and others seeking the production of voluminous documents in connection with various investigations into Tyco International's governance, management, operations, accounting, and related controls. The Department of Labor is investigating Tyco International and the administrators of certain of its benefit plans. Tyco International has advised the Company that it cannot predict when these investigations will be completed, nor can it predict what the results of these investigations may be. It is possible that Tyco International will be required to pay material fines or suffer other penalties. It is not possible to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. As a result, Tyco Electronics share of such potential losses also is not estimable and may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Compliance Matters
        Tyco International has received and responded to various allegations that certain improper payments were made by Tyco International subsidiaries, including Tyco Electronics subsidiaries, in recent years. During 2005 and 2006, Tyco International reported to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC the investigative steps and remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations. Tyco International also informed the DOJ and the SEC that it retained outside counsel to perform a company-wide baseline review of its policies, controls, and practices with respect to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), that it would continue to make periodic progress reports to these agencies, and that it would present its factual findings upon conclusion of the baseline review. Tyco International and Tyco Electronics have had communications with the DOJ and SEC to provide updates on the baseline review being conducted by outside counsel, including, as appropriate, briefings concerning additional instances of potential improper payments identified by Tyco International and the Company in the course of the Company's ongoing compliance activities. To date, the baseline review has revealed that some business practices may not comply with Tyco International and FCPA requirements. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of other allegations reported to regulatory and law enforcement authorities and therefore cannot estimate the range of
potential loss or extent of risk, if any, that may result from an adverse resolution of any or all of these matters. However, it is possible that the Company may be required to pay judgments, suffer penalties, or incur settlements in amounts that may have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any judgment, settlement, or other cost incurred by Tyco International in connection with these matters would be subject to the liability sharing provisions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which provides that any liabilities not primarily related to any of the businesses of Tyco International, Covidien, or Tyco Electronics will be shared equally among the companies.
Intellectual Property and Antitrust Litigation
        The Company is a party to a number of patent infringement and antitrust actions that may require the Company to pay damage awards. The Company has assessed the status of these matters and has recorded liabilities related to certain of these matters where appropriate.
Environmental Matters
        The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods. As of fiscal year end 2007, the Company concluded that it was probable that it would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately $12 million to $23 million. As of fiscal year end 2007, the Company concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately $16 million, of which $3 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $13 million is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In view of the Company's financial position and reserves for environmental matters of $16 million, the Company believes that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Income Taxes
        The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. The Company and Tyco International are reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed as probable and estimable and which relate specifically to the Tyco Electronics business have been recorded in the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, the Company may be required to pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to the electronics businesses as a result of the tax liability sharing arrangements with Tyco International and Covidien entered into upon Separation.
        In fiscal 2004, in connection with the IRS audit of the fiscal 1997 through 2000 years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006, Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through fiscal 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, the Company has determined that
acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, has recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, in the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. These adjustments resulted in a $205 million net decrease in deferred income tax assets and a $205 million decrease in income taxes in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.
        During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International completed proposed amendments to a portion of its U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2001 through 2005 fiscal periods, which primarily reflected the roll forward of the previous amendments for the 1997 to 2002 fiscal periods. These adjustments resulted in a $9 million increase to the tax provision on the Company's Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in fiscal 2007. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2002. When the Company's tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, the Company believes that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
        During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 though 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents' Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The Revenue Agents' Reports propose tax audit adjustments to certain of Tyco International's previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, the Company has made no additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to its share of the proposed audit adjustments in the Revenue Agents' Reports.
        Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact to Tyco International of $458 million, and during the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Tyco International paid $458 million. The Company's portion of this payment reduced income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet by $163 million. Currently, it is the Company's understanding that Tyco International will appeal other proposed tax audit adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. The Company continues to believe that the amounts recorded in its Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to these tax adjustments are sufficient. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could result in Tyco International filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current fiscal 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate in future reporting periods.
        Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Based on statutory guidelines, the Company estimates the proposed penalties could range between $30 million and $50 million. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Currently, it is the Company's understanding that Tyco International will vigorously oppose the assertion of any such penalties.
        In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics' and Tyco International's respective rights,
responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code.
        Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, the Company has entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all liabilities settled by the Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, the Company would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation.
        Upon Separation, $930 million of Tyco International's contingent tax liabilities related to unresolved tax matters were transferred to the Company in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, the Company recorded a receivable from Tyco International and Covidien of $675 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 29, 2007 relating to indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, an analysis of the tax reserves held by the Company, Tyco International, and Covidien indicated that the Company is the primary obligor for an additional $161 million of tax and related interest for which reserves had been recorded on the books of Tyco International and Covidien. Accordingly, the amounts recorded by the Company upon Separation for contingent tax liabilities and the corresponding assets for indemnifications made by Tyco International and Covidien were increased to reflect these additional amounts. The initial liability at Separation and the adjustment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were reflected as adjustments to contributed surplus on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
        The Company's contractual obligation under the Tax Sharing Agreement is 31% of legacy Tyco International contingent tax liabilities, or $675 million. This net obligation is comprised of shared contingent tax liabilities of $1,223 million, adjusted for the contractual obligations among the parties to the Tax Sharing Agreement. These contractual obligations consist of a $844 million receivable from Tyco International and Covidien related to the Company's shared contingent tax liabilities, a $198 million liability applicable to Tyco International and Covidien contingent tax liabilities, and a $98 million liability under FIN 45 related to the estimated fair value of future indemnifications made under the Tax Sharing Agreement. See further discussion in Note 13. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under this agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Company's responsibility for contingent tax liabilities.
Other Matters
        The Company is a defendant in a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions, and dispositions. The Company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
17. Related Party Transactions
Trade Activity
        Prior to Separation, the Company sold certain of its manufactured products consisting primarily of connectors and cable assemblies to Tyco International and its affiliates, at prices which approximated fair value. Sales to Tyco International and its affiliates, which are included in net sales on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations, were $60 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2007 and $76 million in both fiscal 2006 and 2005.
Cash
        During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company transferred $27 million of funds to Tyco International to adjust for differences between the Company's cash balance at June 29, 2007 and its final cash balance as determined in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. This transfer has been recorded as an adjustment to contributed surplus on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
Debt and Related Items
        The Company was allocated a portion of Tyco International's consolidated debt, net interest expense, and loss on retirement of debt. See Note 12 for further information regarding these allocations.
Allocated Expenses
        In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company was allocated a net charge from Tyco International of $887 million related to the class action settlement. See Note 16 for further information regarding the class action settlement.
        Prior to Separation, the Company was allocated general corporate overhead expenses from Tyco International for corporate-related functions based on a pro-rata percentage of Tyco International's consolidated net revenue. General corporate overhead expenses primarily related to centralized corporate functions, including treasury, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, and risk management functions. During fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company was allocated $152 million, $177 million, and $198 million, respectively, of general corporate overhead expenses incurred by Tyco International, which are included within selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations.
        As discussed in Note 1, the Company believes the assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate overhead expenses and net class action settlement costs from Tyco International were reasonable. However, such expenses may not be indicative of the actual level of expenses that would have been or will be incurred by the Company if it were to operate as an independent, publicly-traded company. As such, the financial information herein may not necessarily reflect the consolidated and combined financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company in the future or what it would have been had the Company been an independent, publicly-traded company during the periods presented.
Transactions with Tyco Electronics' and Tyco International's Directors
        During fiscal 2007, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco Electronics' directors were employed and served as officers. Purchases from such companies aggregated less than one percent of net sales in fiscal 2007. In addition, during periods prior to the Separation in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company engaged in commercial transactions in the normal course of business with companies where Tyco International's directors were employed and served as officers. During each of these periods, Tyco Electronics' purchases from such companies aggregated less than one percent of net sales.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
        Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Tyco International and Covidien to effect the Separation and provide a framework for the Company's relationships with Tyco International and Covidien after the distribution of the Company's and Covidien's shares to Tyco International's shareholders (the "Distribution"). These agreements govern the relationships among Tyco International, Covidien, and the Company subsequent to the Separation and provide for the allocation to the Company and Covidien of certain of Tyco International's assets, liabilities, and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Separation.
        Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements, subject to certain exceptions contained in the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company, Covidien, and Tyco International assumed 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of certain of Tyco International's contingent and other corporate liabilities. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these contingent and other corporate liabilities will be shared equally among the parties. These contingent and other corporate liabilities primarily relate to consolidated securities litigation and any actions with respect to the Separation or the Distribution brought by any third party. If any party responsible for such liabilities were to default in its payment, when due, of any of these assumed obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non-defaulting party the amounts in default. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, Tyco Electronics may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed-upon share of the assumed obligations related to such contingent and other corporate liabilities, including associated costs and expenses.
Tax Sharing Agreement
        Upon Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, under which the Company shares responsibility for certain of its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's income tax liabilities based on a sharing formula for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The Company, Covidien, and Tyco International share 31%, 42%, and 27%, respectively, of U.S. income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's U.S. income tax returns.
The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify the Company for 69% of all liabilities settled by the Company with respect to unresolved legacy tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, the Company has made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of all liabilities settled by the companies relating to unresolved legacy tax matters. All costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities shall be shared equally among the parties. The Company will be responsible for all of its own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien will be responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula.
        All of the tax liabilities of Tyco International that were associated with Tyco International subsidiaries that are included in Tyco Electronics following the Separation became Tyco Electronics' tax liabilities upon Separation. Although Tyco Electronics has agreed to share certain tax liabilities with Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco Electronics remains primarily liable for all of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Covidien default on their obligations to Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco Electronics would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities.
        If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of the distribution taxes that arise as a result of no party's fault, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non-defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments. Accordingly, under certain circumstances, the Company may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of its agreed upon share of its, Tyco International's, and Covidien's tax liabilities.
18. Income Taxes
        Significant components of the income tax provision for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 are as follows:
        The U.S. and non-U.S. components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest for 2007, 2006, and 2005 are as follows:
        The reconciliation between U.S. federal income taxes at the statutory rate and the Company's provision for income taxes on continuing operations for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 are as follows:
(1)
Excludes asset impairments, nondeductible charges, and other items which are broken out separately in the table.
        In fiscal year 2007, no tax benefits were recorded related to the pre-tax charges for the class action settlement and loss on retirement of debt. The net increase of $26 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal 2007 reflects the tax impacts of increased borrowings as a result of the class action settlement and the Company's separation from Tyco International.
        The net decrease of $268 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal 2006 is primarily driven by improved profitability in certain jurisdictions, principally the U.S. The Company's U.S. results of operations in fiscal 2006 combined with other available evidence, including projections of future taxable income, indicate that it is more likely than not the Company will realize additional
deferred tax assets in the future and accordingly the related valuation allowances were reduced. Reflected in the state tax provision line for fiscal 2006 is a $39 million state tax benefit primarily related to the Tyco Global Network divestiture.
        The allocated loss on retirement of debt in fiscal 2006 is a cumulative one-time benefit of $87 million associated with the receipt of a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling permitting the deduction of historical debt retirement costs. This benefit is partially offset by an increased valuation allowance of $62 million relating to the deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses created by the debt retirement deductions. This $62 million is reflected on the valuation allowance line in the table above.
        Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax asset at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006 are as follows:
        At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $1,253 million of U.S. federal and $192 million of U.S state net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) which will expire in future years through 2027. In addition, at fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $143 million of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards, of which $22 million have no expiration and $121 million will expire in future years through 2027, and $40 million of U.S. state tax credits carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2027. The Company also had $5 million of U.S. federal contribution carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2011 and $21 million of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) expiring through 2010 at fiscal year end 2007.
        At fiscal year end 2007, the Company had approximately $466 million of net operating loss carryforwards (tax effected) in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which $164 million have no expiration and $302 million will expire in future years through 2017. Also, at fiscal year end 2007, there were
$6 million of non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which will expire in future years through 2013 and $9 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards (tax effected) with no expiration.
        The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $703 million and $611 million at fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "
Accounting for Income Taxes
," which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is "more likely than not" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. At fiscal year end 2007, approximately $4 million of the valuation allowance will ultimately reduce goodwill and approximately $16 million of the valuation allocation will be recorded to equity if certain net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are utilized.
        The Company and its subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various regulatory tax authorities. See "Income Taxes" in Note 16 for further information.
        The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across its global operations. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities as well as related interest for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. The Company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities may result in income tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year.
        Except for earnings that are currently distributed, no additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or the Company has concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. A liability could arise if the intention to permanently reinvest earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries.
19. Other Expense, Net
        Other expense, net of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 12 for additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, the Company recorded other income of $13 million associated with Tyco International's and Covidien's share of certain contingent tax liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International. For further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement, see Notes 16 and 17.
        Other expense, net in fiscal 2005 includes an allocation of $365 million from Tyco International for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 12 for additional information.
        The allocation methodology for the loss on retirement of debt is consistent with the treatment of debt and net interest expense as described in Note 12. Management believes that this allocation was reasonable given the impact such retirements had on the overall capital structure of Tyco International. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual losses on the retirement of debt that the Company would have incurred had the Company been operating as a separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented.
20. (Loss) Earnings Per Share
        The computation of basic (loss) earnings per share is based on the Company's net (loss) income divided by the basic weighted-average number of common shares. On June 29, 2007, the Separation from Tyco International was completed in a tax-free distribution to the Company's shareholders of one common share of Tyco Electronics Ltd. for every four common shares of Tyco International held on June 18, 2007. As a result, on June 29, 2007, the Company had 497 million common shares outstanding. The same number of shares is being used for both diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for all periods prior to the date of Separation as no Tyco Electronics equity awards were outstanding prior to the Separation.
        The following table sets forth the denominators of the basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share computations:
        For the year ended September 28, 2007, options to purchase Tyco Electronics' common shares with the underlying exercise prices less than the average market prices were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share, as inclusion of these securities would have been antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation of diluted loss per share totaled 3 million as of September 28, 2007.
        In addition, certain share option awards were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for the year ended September 28, 2007 because the instruments' underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of Tyco Electronics' common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation of diluted loss per share totaled 20 million as of September 28, 2007.
        The Separation and Distribution Agreement entered into pursuant to Separation requires that the Company issue common shares, as needed, to satisfy convertible debentures issued prior to Separation by Tyco International and retained by Tyco International subsequent to Separation. Up to approximately 250,000 shares could be issued to satisfy convertible debentures. For the year ended September 28, 2007, the number of shares issuable to holders of unconverted Tyco International debt would be antidilutive. Such shares not included in the computation of diluted loss per share were insignificant as of September 28, 2007.
        The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share utilizing the net income for the year and the Company's basic and diluted shares outstanding:
21. Equity
Parent Company Investment
        For all periods prior to June 29, 2007, Tyco International's investment in the electronics businesses is shown as parent company investment in the Combined Financial Statements. Parent company investment represents the historical investment of capital into the Company, the Company's accumulated net earnings after taxes, and the net effect of transactions with and allocations from Tyco International. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the allocation to the Company of various expenses incurred by Tyco International.
        On June 29, 2007, Tyco International completed a distribution of one common share of Tyco Electronics Ltd. for every four common shares of Tyco International. Following the Separation, the Company had 497 million common shares outstanding. After the Separation adjustments were recorded on June 29, 2007, the remaining parent company investment balance, which includes all earnings prior to the Separation, was transferred to contributed surplus. Net income subsequent to the Separation is included in accumulated earnings.
Preferred Shares
        The Company has authorized 125,000,000 preferred shares, par value of $0.20 per share, none of which were issued and outstanding at September 28, 2007. Rights as to dividends, return of capital, redemption, conversion, voting, and otherwise with respect to the preferred shares may be determined
by the Company's board of directors on or before the time of issuance. In the event of the liquidation of the Company, the holders of any preferred shares then outstanding would be entitled to payment to them of the amount for which the preferred shares were subscribed and any unpaid dividends prior to any payment to the common shareholders.
Dividends
        In September 2007, the Company's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per common share to be paid on November 1, 2007. The declared but unpaid dividend is recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2007.
Share Repurchase Program
        In September 2007, the Company's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $750 million to purchase a portion of the Company's outstanding common shares. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007.
22. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
        The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows:
(1)
During fiscal 2006, $38 million was transferred from currency translation adjustments as a result of the sale of non-U.S. entities. The $38 million gain is included in (loss) income from discontinued operations in the Combined Statement of Operations. During fiscal 2005, $30 million was transferred from currency translation adjustments and included in net income as a result of the sale of non-U.S. entities. The $30 million gain in fiscal 2005 related to the Tyco Global Network and is included in gain on divestiture in the Combined Statement of Operations.
23. Share Plans
        Prior to Separation on June 29, 2007, all equity awards (restricted share awards and share options) held by Company employees were granted under the Tyco International Ltd. 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan or other Tyco International equity incentive plans. All equity awards granted by the Company subsequent to Separation were granted under the Tyco Electronics Ltd. 2007 Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan is administered by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Tyco Electronics, which consists exclusively of independent directors of Tyco Electronics and provides for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, annual performance bonuses, long-term performance awards, restricted units, deferred stock units, restricted stock, promissory stock, and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards"). The 2007 Plan provides for a maximum of 25 million common shares to be issued as Awards, subject to adjustment as provided under the terms of the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan allows for the use of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares to be used to satisfy such awards.
        Prior to the Separation, all employee equity awards were granted by Tyco International. At the time of Separation, significantly all of Tyco International's outstanding restricted share awards issued to Company employees prior to September 29, 2006 were converted into restricted share awards of the Company at a ratio of one share of the Company for every four Tyco International common shares. The conversion of those pre-September 29, 2006 awards also resulted in the issuance of one restricted share award in Tyco International and Covidien. The conversion of pre-September 29, 2006 awards to executives and employees of Tyco International and Covidien resulted in the issuance of a Tyco Electronics Ltd. restricted share award for every four Tyco International awards that existed. The remaining restricted share and share option awards issued to Company employees converted into restricted share and share option awards of the Company based on a ratio of the Company's final pre-Separation when-issued share price and Tyco International's pre-Separation closing share price. All share option awards granted prior to September 29, 2006 to Company employees who were identified as "Tyco Corporate Employees' prior to Separation converted to share option awards in each of the three post-Separation companies based on ratios of the respective company's final pre-Separation when-issued share price and Tyco International's pre-Separation closing share price. All share option award conversions were done in accordance with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code. Upon Separation, all performance conditions on outstanding performance share awards to Company employees were lifted and those awards converted to restricted share awards in the Company's stock only.
Restricted Share Awards
        Restricted share awards are granted subject to certain restrictions. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. All restrictions on the award will lapse upon retirement or normal retirement eligibility, death, or disability of the employee. Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights and receive dividend equivalents. For grants which vest based on certain specified performance criteria, the fair market value of the shares or units is expensed over the period of performance, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable. For grants that vest through passage of time, the fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The fair value of restricted share awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. Restricted share awards generally vest in one-third increments over a period of four years beginning in the second year, as determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee, or upon attainment of various levels of performance that
equal or exceed targeted levels, if applicable. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
        A summary of the status of restricted share awards and performance share grants by Tyco International prior to Separation and Tyco Electronics subsequent to Separation as of fiscal year end 2007 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:
        Included in the Awards granted pursuant to Separation above are 1,337,767 restricted share awards granted to employees and executives of Tyco International and Covidien. Fifty percent of those awards vested on July 2, 2007 and the remaining fifty percent will vest on January 2, 2008. Any expense related to this accelerated vesting is borne by the company employing the individual to whom the grant was awarded, either Tyco International or Covidien.
        Fifty percent of the expense associated with issuance of Tyco International and Covidien restricted share awards made to employees of the Company as a result of the Separation was recorded by the Company on July 2, 2007 and the remaining fifty percent is being expensed ratably through January 2, 2008. This acceleration of expense for Company employees is borne by the Company and is included in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations within separation costs and (loss) income from discontinued operations.
        The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco International restricted share awards granted to Tyco Electronics employees during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $30.34, $28.96, and $35.52 respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco Electronics restricted share awards granted during fiscal 2007 was $39.69. The total fair value of restricted share awards vested for grants made by Tyco International to Tyco Electronics employees was $19 million during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, $5 million during fiscal 2006, and less than $1 million during fiscal 2005. The total fair
value of restricted share awards vested for grants made by Tyco Electronics was $25 million during fiscal 2007.
        The total fair value of Tyco International performance shares granted to Tyco Electronics employees vested during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was insignificant. Tyco Electronics issued no performance shares during fiscal 2007.
        As of fiscal year end 2007, there was $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to both non-vested Tyco Electronics restricted share awards and performance shares. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 fiscal years.
Deferred Stock Units
        Deferred Stock Units ("DSUs") are notional units that are tied to the value of Tyco Electronics common shares with distribution deferred until termination of employment. Distribution, when made, will be in the form of actual shares. Similar to restricted share grants that vest through the passage of time, the fair value of DSUs is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Recipients of DSUs do not have the right to vote such shares and do not have the right to receive cash dividends. However, they have the right to receive dividend equivalents, which are delivered at the same time as the underlying DSUs. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. During fiscal year 2007, the Company granted 44,450 DSUs that vested immediately. The grant date fair value of those grants was expensed immediately and was determined to be insignificant.
Share Options
        Share options (or Options) are granted to purchase Tyco Electronics common shares at prices which are equal to or greater than the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant under the 2007 Plan. Options generally vest and become exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of four years and will generally expire 10 years after the date of grant.
        As a result of the Separation, 7,217,640 share option awards were issued to employees and executives of Tyco International and Covidien. Share option activity for grants by Tyco International
prior to Separation and Tyco Electronics subsequent to Separation as of fiscal year end 2007 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:
        The conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards at Separation was considered a modification of an award in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, "
Share Based Payment
." As a result, the Company compared the fair value of the award immediately prior to the Separation to the fair value immediately after the Separation to measure incremental compensation cost. The conversion resulted in an increase in the fair value of the awards of $13 million. Of that amount, the Company recorded non-cash compensation expense of $11 million in separation costs in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations for fiscal year 2007. The remaining $2 million of modification expense will be recorded through 2011.
        As of fiscal year end 2007, there was $58 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Tyco Electronics share options granted under Tyco Electronics share option plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
Stock-Based Compensation
        Effective October 1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. As a result, the Company's results from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 include incremental share-based compensation expense of $40 million. Share-based compensation cost during fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 totaled $100 million, $69 million, and $20 million, respectively, of which $93 million, $64 million, and $19 million, respectively, have been included in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within selling, general, and administrative
expenses and separation costs. Share-based compensation expense of $7 million, $5 million, and $1 million, respectively, has been included in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations within (loss), income from discontinued operations, net of tax for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements of $27 million, $19 million, and $6 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
        Prior to October 1, 2005, the Company accounted for share-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the stock at the date of grant. If Tyco International and the Company applied the fair value based method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, for share options granted by Tyco International to Tyco Electronics employees, the effect on net income would have been as follows:
        The grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected stock price volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of a composite of peers of Tyco Electronics and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options on that same composite of peers. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on Tyco Electronics' expected dividend rate. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
        The weighted-average assumptions Tyco International used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 are as follows:
        The weighted-average assumptions Tyco Electronics used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for post-Separation grants in fiscal 2007 are as follows:
        The weighted-average grant-date fair values of Tyco International options granted to Tyco Electronics employees during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $9.52, $8.96, and $10.97, respectively. The total intrinsic value of Tyco International options exercised by Tyco Electronics employees during pre-Separation fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $48 million, $22 million, and $32 million, respectively.
        The weighted-average grant-date fair value of Tyco Electronics options granted during post-Separation fiscal 2007 was $12.34. The total intrinsic value of Tyco Electronics options exercised during post-Separation fiscal 2007 was $7 million. The total cash received by the Company related to the exercise of options totaled $14 million. The related excess cash tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for fiscal 2007 in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows was not significant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plans
        The Company has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESP Plan"). Substantially all full-time employees of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in this employee share purchase plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. The Company matches a portion of the employee contribution by contributing an additional 15% of the employee's payroll deduction on the first $40,000 of payroll deductions. All shares purchased under the ESP Plan are purchased on the open market by a designated broker. The Company expects to allow participation in the ESP Plan during the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
        Tyco Electronics also maintains two other employee stock purchase plans for the benefit of employees of certain qualified non-U.S. subsidiaries. The terms of these plans provided employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's stock at a stated price and receive certain tax benefits.
        The Company has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ltd. Savings Related Share Plan (the "UK SAYE Plan"). Under the UK SAYE Plan, eligible employees in the United Kingdom are granted options to purchase shares at the end of three years of service at 85% of the market price at the time of grant. Options under the UK SAYE Plan are generally exercisable after a period of three years and expire six months after the date of vesting. The Company expects to allow participation in the UK SAYE Plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
        The Company also has adopted the Tyco Electronics Ireland Limited Irish Revenue Approved Profit Sharing Plan (the "Irish Bonus Plan"). Under the Irish Bonus Plan, eligible employees are offered the opportunity to acquire shares using a portion of their bonus. Such employees also have the opportunity to forego a portion of their basic salary to purchase additional shares. The Company expects to allow participation in the Irish Bonus Plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
24. Consolidated and Combined Segment and Geographic Data
        The Company aggregates its operating segments into four reportable segments based upon the Company's internal business structure. See Note 1 for a description of the segments in which the Company operates. Segment performance is evaluated based on net sales and operating income. Generally, the Company considers all expenses to be of an operating nature, and, accordingly, allocates them to each reportable segment. Costs specific to a segment are charged to the segment.
