ITEM 1.01             ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On July 14, 2008, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics"), issued an aggregate of $300,000,000 principal amount of its 5.950% Senior Notes due January 15, 2014 (the "Notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment by Tyco Electronics. The Notes were offered and sold by TEGSA pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152069).  The net proceeds from the sales of the Notes were approximately $298.4 million after deducting the underwriters' discount but before other expenses and will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of July 9, 2008, among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and Goldman Sachs & Co. and UBS Securities LLC, in their capacity as representatives of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters").  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein, TEGSA agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public.  TEGSA sold Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 99.452% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the Notes to the public at a price of 99.972% of the principal amount thereof.
 
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto.  The Underwriting Agreement is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Additional information pertaining to the Notes is contained in Item 2.03 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ITEM 2.03             CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OF A REGISTRANT
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of September 25, 2007 (the "Indenture"), among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and a Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 14, 2008 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture") among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and the Trustee. The Trustee will receive customary fees in connection therewith.  The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by Tyco Electronics. The Notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
 
TEGSA may redeem some or all of the Notes at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. TEGSA may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such Notes.
 
The interest rate payable on the Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time for certain downgrades (or subsequent upgrades) to the debt rating assigned to such Notes by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Limited.
 
The Indenture limits TEGSA's ability to create liens to secure certain indebtedness without also securing the Notes and limits its ability to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. The Indenture also limits TEGSA's and Tyco Electronics' ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.
 
If Tyco Electronics experiences a change of control and, as a result of that change of control, the Notes are rated below investment grade by at least two of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Limited (or the equivalent under any successor rating categories of Standard and Poor's, Moody's or Fitch's, respectively), and TEGSA has not redeemed such notes, TEGSA will offer to
repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
 
The following are events of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes:
 
default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any Notes, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
                 
 
default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of or premium, if any, on any of the Notes; or
                 
 
default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of Tyco Electronics or TEGSA in respect of the Notes and the guarantee (other than the failure to comply with any covenant or agreement to file with the trustee the information filed or required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a default or breach specifically dealt with elsewhere), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days; or
                 
 
the guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by Tyco Electronics or TEGSA not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms except to the extent contemplated by the Indenture and the guarantee; or
                 
 
a court shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of TEGSA or Tyco Electronics in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
                 
 
TEGSA or Tyco Electronics shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; or
                 
 
an event of default shall happen and be continuing with respect to TEGSA's or Tyco Electronics' indebtedness for borrowed money under any indenture or other instrument evidencing or under which TEGSA or Tyco Electronics shall have a principal amount outstanding in excess of $100,000,000 and such event of default shall involve the failure to pay the principal of such indebtedness on the final maturity date thereof after expiration of any grace period or in certain circumstances involving acceleration of the indebtedness such that the principal shall become due and payable prior to the date on which it otherwise would be due and payable.
                 
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture which is filed as Exhibit 4.1(a) to Tyco Electronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007, filed on December 14, 2007 and to the full text of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.  Each of the foregoing documents is incorporated by reference herein.

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other
(c)
                                 
 
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities
(d)
                                
 
purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchasing obligations and not joint.
 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, within the meaning of the Act.
(e)
                                 
 
(a)If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than  seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantor agree to prepare promptly any amendments to the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
10.
          
                                 
 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(b)
                                
 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of
(c)
                                 
 
the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
11.
          
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company or the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
12.
          
 
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you by the Representatives.  All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the Representatives in care of Goldman, Sachs & Co., One New York Plaza, 42nd Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department, and UBS Securities LLC, 677 Washington Blvd., Stamford, CT 06901, facsimile number 203-719-0495, Attention: Fixed Income Syndicate; if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Prospectus, Attention: Secretary; if to the Guarantor shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Guarantor set forth in the Prospectus, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company and the Guarantor by you upon request.  Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

provided
however
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securitiesfrom any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason
14.
          
 
merely of such purchase.
 
Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
15.
          
 
Each of the Company and the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Guarantor, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) each of the Company and the Guarantor has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriter, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
16.
          
 
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company or the Guarantor and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
17.
          
 
18.
          
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
The Company, the Guarantor and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
19.
          
 
Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or United States Federal court sitting in The City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.  To the extent that the Company or the Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property, each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. Each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding paragraph and agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be made upon it at the office of such agent.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by law, any other requirements of or objections to personal jurisdiction with respect thereto.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor represents and warrants that such agent has agreed to act as its agent for service of process, and the Company and the
20.
          
 
Guarantor each agrees to take any and all action, including the filing of any and all documents and instruments, that may be necessary to continue such appointment in full force and effect.
 
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the purchasers could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from either of them to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.  If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter against such loss.  If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder.
21.
          
 
This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
22.
          
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the Guarantor are authorized to disclose to any and all persons, the tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company or the Guarantor relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax treatment" means US federal and state income tax treatment, and "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
23.
          
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us ten counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor.  It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

ANNEX I
 
Deloitte & Touche Comfort Letter
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have audited the consolidated and combined balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the "Company") and subsidiaries as of September 28, 2007 and September 29, 2006, and the consolidated and combined statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 28, 2007, and the related financial statement schedule, all included in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 27, 2008, and incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-152069) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act); our report (which report expresses an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes explanatory paragraphs referring to a) related party transactions with Tyco International Ltd. and allocations of corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, other expenses, debt and related interest expense from Tyco International which may not be reflective of the actual level of costs or debt which would have been incurred had Tyco Electronics operated as a separate entity apart from Tyco International, b) the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, , c) certain guarantee commitments with Tyco International and Covidien Ltd., d) the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, , in 2006, e) a change to the measurement date of pension and post retirement plans from September 30 to August 31 in 2005 and f) the retrospective adjustment of the financial statements for discontinued operations.) with respect thereto is also incorporated by reference in that registration statement.  The registration statement and the preliminary prospectus supplement dated July 9, 2008, are herein referred to as the registration statement.

In connection with the registration statement
 
1.
                   
We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB").
 
2.
                   
In our opinion, the consolidated and combined financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by us and incorporated by reference in the registration statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
3.
                   
We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 28, 2007; although we have conducted an audit for the year ended September 28, 2007, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated and combined financial statements as of September 28, 2007, and for the year then ended, but not on the Company's financial statements for any interim period within that year.  Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined balance sheet as of December 28, 2007, or March 28, 2008, and the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, or the three and six-month periods ended March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007,
included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 28, 2007, and March 28, 2008, respectively; incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 28, 2007.
 
4.
                   
For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2008 minutes of the meetings of the shareholders, the board of directors, the audit committee, and the compensation committee of the Company and its subsidiaries as set forth in the minutes books at July 7, 2008, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein except for the meetings that occurred on May 12, 2008 and May 13, 2008; we have carried out other procedures to July 3, 2008, as follows (our work did not extend to the period from July 4, 2008, to July 9, 2008, inclusive):
 
a.
                    
With respect to the three and six-month periods ended March 28, 2008 and March 30, 2007, we have
 
(i)
                      
Performed the procedures specified by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information as described in SAS 100, on the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements for these periods, described in 3, included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2008, incorporated by reference in the registration statement.
Interim Financial Information,
 
(ii)
                   
Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements referred to in a(i) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
b.
                   
With respect to the period from March 29, 2008, to May 30, 2008, we have
 
(i)
                       
Read the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries for April and May of 2008 furnished us by the Company, officials of the Company having advised us that no such financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to May 30, 2008, were available.
 
(ii)
                   
Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited consolidated financial statements referred to in b(i) are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated and combined financial statements incorporated by reference in the registration statement.
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph.  Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
5.
                    
Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that
 
a.
                
(i)
                           
Any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements described in 3, incorporated by reference in the registration
statement, for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
(ii)
                   
The unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements described in 3 do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
b.
                  
(i)
                        
At May 30, 2008, there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity of the consolidated company as compared with amounts shown in the March 28, 2008 unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the registration statement except for a decrease in consolidated net current assets of $118 million, or
 
(ii)
                   
For the period from March 29, 2008, to May 30, 2008, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or gross income, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
6.
                    
As mentioned in 4b(i), Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to May 30, 2008, are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after May 30, 2008, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4.  We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at July 3, 2008, there was any change in the capital stock, increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or shareholders' equity of the consolidated company as compared with amounts shown on the March 28, 2008, unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included in the registration statement or (b) for the period from March 29, 2008, to July 3, 2008, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or gross income.
 
On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, we noted that
 
a.
                          
Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the balance of capital stock (after rounding to the nearest million) changed during the period, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
b.

The execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantor of the Underwriting Agreement, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee, as the case may be, and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations thereunder and under the Base Indenture will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document listed on Schedule A hereto; and (ii) the laws of the State of New York or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or Blue Sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph).

The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes and the Guarantee", "Benefit Plan Investor Considerations" and "Underwriting" insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information required with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.

8.
              
The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and we are not aware of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.

ANNEX IV
 
Form of Appleby Opinion Pursuant to Section 8(e)
 
opinion of Appleby Hunter Bailhache, Bermuda counsel for the Guarantor, to be delivered pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Underwriting Agreement shall be to the effect that:
The
 
(1)
                               
The Guarantor is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability and existing under the laws of Bermuda.  The Guarantor possesses the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name and is in good standing under the laws of Bermuda.
 
(2)
                               
The Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Subject Agreements and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
(3)
                               
The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Guarantor.
 
(4)
                               
The Subject Agreements have been duly executed by the Guarantor and each constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.
 
(5)
                               
Subject to the procedure on enforcement of foreign judgements outlined in paragraph (11) of this opinion, no consent, licence or authorisation of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority or court of Bermuda is required to be obtained by the Guarantor in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Guarantor of the Subject Agreements or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Guarantor, of the Subject Agreements.
 
(6)
                               
The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any requirement of any law or any regulation of Bermuda or (ii) the Constitutional Documents.
 
(7)
                               
The transactions contemplated by the Subject Agreements are not subject to any currency deposit or reserve requirements in Bermuda.  The Guarantor has been designated as "non-resident" for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and regulations made thereunder and there is no restriction or requirement of Bermuda binding on the Guarantor which limits the availability or transfer of foreign exchange (i.e. monies denominated in currencies other than Bermuda dollars) for the purposes of the performance by the Guarantor of its obligations under the Subject Agreements.
 
(8)
                               
The statements made in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus under the sections "Certain Luxembourg, Bermuda and United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" and "Risk Factors", under the sub-heading "Bermuda and Luxembourg law differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities" to the extent that they summarize or are statements of the Constitutional Documents or Bermuda law and legal conclusions thereunder, have been reviewed by us and fairly present the information disclosed therein in all material respects.
(9)
                               
The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the proper law to govern the Subject Agreements is a valid choice of law under Bermuda law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of Bermuda as the proper law of the Subject Agreements in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Subject Agreements, provided that (i) the point is specifically pleaded; (ii) such choice of law is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York; and (iii) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Bermuda law.
 
(10)
                         
The submission by the Guarantor to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York pursuant to the Subject Agreements is not contrary to Bermuda law and would be recognised by the courts of Bermuda as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, if such submission is accepted by such courts and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York.
 
(11)
                         
A final and conclusive judgment of a competent foreign court against the Guarantor based upon the Subject Agreements (other than a court of jurisdiction to which The Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1958 applies, and it does not apply to the courts of the State of New York) under which a sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, in respect of a fine or other penalty, or in respect of multiple damages as defined in The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1981) may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the judgment of such competent foreign court.  A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign court's judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
 
(i)
                                   
the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in Bermuda; and
 
(ii)
                                
the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Bermuda, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Bermuda law.
 
Enforcement of such a judgment against assets in Bermuda may involve the conversion of the judgment debt into Bermuda dollars, but the Bermuda Monetary Authority has indicated that its present policy is to give the consents necessary to enable recovery in the currency of the obligation.
 
(12)
                         
The appointment by the Guarantor of CT Corporation System as agent for the receipt of any service of process in respect of any court in the State of New York in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with the Subject Agreements is a valid and effective appointment, if such appointment is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York and if no other procedural requirements are necessary in order to validate such appointment.
 
(13)
                         
Neither the Guarantor nor any of its assets or property enjoys, under Bermuda law, immunity on the grounds of sovereignty from any legal or other proceedings whatsoever or from enforcement, execution or attachment in respect of its obligations under the Subject Agreements.
 
IV-2
 
(14)
                         
Based solely upon the Company Search and the Litigation Search:
 
(i)
                                   
no litigation, administrative or other proceeding of or before any governmental authority of Bermuda is pending  against the Guarantor; and
 
(ii)
                                
no notice to the Registrar of Companies of the passing of a resolution of members or creditors to wind up or the appointment of a liquidator or receiver has been given.  No petition to wind up the Guarantor or application to reorganise its affairs pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement or application for the appointment of a receiver has been filed with the Supreme Court.
 
(15)
                         
The Guarantor has received an assurance from the Ministry of Finance granting an exemption, until 28 March 2016, from the imposition of tax under any applicable Bermuda law computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, provided that such exemption shall not prevent the application of any such tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda and shall not prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to land in Bermuda leased to the Guarantor.  There are, subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no Bermuda taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges now due, or which could in the future become due, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Subject Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Guarantor is not required by any Bermuda law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in Bermuda from any payment it may make thereunder.
 
The Company has requested that we provide this opinion which is required pursuant to section 8(e) of the Underwriting Agreement in connection with the following agreements:
 
(i)
            
Indenture;
 
(ii)
         
Underwriting Agreement;
 
(iii)
      
Guarantees, (collectively referred to as the "Subject Agreements")
ANNEX V
 
Form of General Counsel Opinion Pursuant to Section 8(f)
 
The opinion of Robert A. Scott, the General Counsel for the Guarantor, to be delivered pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Underwriting Agreement shall be to the effect that:
 
Each Significant Subsidiary is validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation; and all of the issued shares of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and (except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or indirectly by the Guarantor; and
A.
                                  
 
Each Significant Subsidiary of the Guarantor organized under the laws of any of the United States is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus (including in each case the documents incorporated therein) and is duly qualified to transact business.

The initial aggregate principal amount of the Offered Securities that may be authenticated and delivered under the Base Indenture (except for Offered Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of, transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Offered Securities pursuant to Section 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.11, or 3.03) is $300,000,000.

The entire Outstanding principal of the Offered Securities shall be payable on January 15, 2014.

(A)The rate at which the Offered Securities shall bear interest initially shall be 5.950% per year (the "") payable as set forth in the Offered Securities, and shall be subject to adjustments as provided in Section 1.1(4)(B).  The date from which interest shall accrue on the Offered Securities shall be July 14, 2008, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  The Interest Payment Dates for the Offered Securities shall be January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2009.  Interest shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date to the holders of record at the close of business on the January 1 and July 1 prior to each Interest Payment Date (a "").  The basis upon which interest shall be calculated shall be that of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.

Original Interest Rate
regular record date
 
The interest rate payable on the Offered Securities shall be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody's, S&P or Fitch downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Offered Securities as set forth in this Section 1.1(4)(B).  If the rating from Moody's, S&P or Fitch of the Offered Securities is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase from the Original Interest Rate by adding the percentage set forth opposite the rating applicable to the lowest two rating levels assigned to such Offered Securities by any of Moody's, S&P and Fitch:
(B)
                               
 
 
If at any time the interest rate on the Offered Securities has been adjusted upward and Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as the case may be, subsequently increases its rating of the Offered Securities to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall be decreased such that the interest rate for the Offered Securities equals the Original Interest Rate plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase applicable to the two lowest rating levels assigned to such Offered Securities by any of Moody's, S&P or Fitch.  If Moody's subsequently increases its rating of the Offered Securities to Baa3 or higher, S&P increases its rating to BBB- or higher and Fitch increases its rating to BBB- or higher, the interest rate on the Offered Securities will be decreased to the Original Interest Rate.
 
Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's, S&P or Fitch, shall be made independent of any and allother adjustments; provided that in determining any adjustment, the percentage applicable to the lowest two rating levels assigned to the Offered Securities by any of Moody's, S&P and Fitch shall be used.  In no event shall (1) the interest rate for the Offered Securities be reduced to below the Original Interest Rate or (2) the total increase in the interest rate on the Offered Securities exceed 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.
If any two of Moody's, S&P or Fitch cease to provide a rating of the Offered Securities, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Offered Securities necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency continuing to provide the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above.  No adjustments in the interest rate of the Offered Securities shall be made solely as a result of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide a rating.  If Moody's, S&P and Fitch all cease to provide a rating of the Offered Securities, the interest rate on the Offered Securities shall increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the Original Interest Rate.  References to Moody's, S&P and Fitch in this Section 1.1(4)(B) shall be deemed to include any successors to Moody's, S&P and Fitch.
 
Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect from the first day of the interest period during which a rating change requires an adjustment in the interest rate.
 
The interest rate on the Offered Security will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustments described in this Section 1.1(4)(B) (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any or all of Moody's, S&P or Fitch or any or all of Moody's, S&P or Fitch ceasing to provide ratings) and shall be set at the Original Interest Rate if the Offered Securities become rated A3, A- or A- or higher by any two of Moody's, S&P and Fitch, respectively (or one of these ratings if only rated by one of Moody's, S&P and Fitch), with a stable or positive outlook by both such rating agencies.

("Parent") and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 14, 2008 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), by and among the Company, Parent and the Trustee.  The Base Indenture as supplemented and amended by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture is referred to herein as the "Indenture."  By the terms of the Base Indenture, the debt securities issuable thereunder are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Base Indenture.  This security is one of the series designated on the face hereof (individually, a "Security," and collectively, the "Securities"), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee, the Company, Parent and the holders of the Securities (the "Securityholders").
