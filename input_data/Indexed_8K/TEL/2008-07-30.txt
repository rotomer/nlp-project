        PEMBROKE, BermudaJuly 30, 2008Tyco Electronics Ltd. (NYSE: TEL; BSX: TEL) today reported net sales of $3.9 billion for the fiscal third quarter ended June 27, 2008, an increase of 19 percent over the prior-year period. Excluding currency effects, organic sales growth was 11 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $0.66 for the quarter, compared to a loss of $1.88 in the prior-year period. Included in EPS from continuing operations were $0.04 of net chargescomprised of $0.02 per share of restructuring costs and a $0.02 per share charge related to the company's portion of a Tyco International securities litigation settlement. This compares to $2.37 per share of charges in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.70 in the quarter, an increase of 43 percent over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.49.
        "Since we became an independent company one year ago, we've delivered four quarters of solid results," said Tyco Electronics Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch. "In the third quarter, we continued to benefit from the breadth of our business, which enabled us to grow 11 percent organically. This growth, coupled with improved operating leverage in our Electronic Components segment and a favorable sales mix in our Undersea and Wireless segments, resulted in a 22 percent increase in operating income."
        Organic Sales Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Margin and Free Cash Flow are all non-GAAP financial measures and are described at the end of this press release. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, see the attached tables. All dollar amounts are pre-tax and stated in millions. All comparisons are to the quarter ended June 29, 2007 unless otherwise indicated.
        GAAP operating income was $537 million, compared to an operating loss of $507 million in the prior-year period. The operating margin on a GAAP basis was 13.7 percent. Included in the current quarter operating income was a $7 million net charge related to the company's portion of a Tyco International securities litigation settlement and $16 million of restructuring costs. Included in prior-year operating income were $25 million of restructuring costs, $50 million of separation-related costs and $891 million of costs related to the company's share of Tyco International's securities class action litigation settlement. Excluding these items in both periods, adjusted operating income was $560 million compared to $459 million a year ago, an increase of 22 percent. The adjusted operating margin was 14.3 percent, compared to 13.9 percent a year ago, primarily reflecting the benefit of higher sales volumes, productivity improvements in the Electronic Components segment, and a favorable sales mix in the Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems segments.
CASH FLOW
        Free cash flow was $283 million in the quarter, a decrease of 13 percent from the prior-year quarter. Higher income levels compared to the prior-year quarter were more than offset by a decrease in deferred revenue and the timing of interest payments.
OTHER ITEMS
 - 
During the quarter, Tyco Electronics announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for $425 million in cash. On July 28, Tyco Electronics signed a definitive agreement to sell its automotive radar sensors business for $42 million in cash. The results of both businesses were previously reported as discontinued operations.
 - 
Tyco Electronics' Board of Directors has authorized a $750 million increase in the company's share repurchase program. This brings the total share repurchase program authorization to $2.0 billion.
ORDERS
        Total company orders grew 28 percent compared to the prior year. On an organic basis, excluding the effects of currency translation, orders grew 20 percent and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.07. Excluding the company's Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems segments, which are project-oriented businesses with uneven order patterns, orders grew 13 percent overall and 5 percent organically in the quarter, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.00.
FISCAL 2008 OUTLOOK
        The company now expects adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.63 to $2.65 for the full fiscal year 2008, compared to $2.14 in the prior yearan increase of 23 to 24 percent. This compares to the company's prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.66 per share. The company continues to expect restructuring-related costs of approximately $130 million ($0.17 per share) for the full year. The company further expects full-year sales growth of 14 to 16 percent with organic sales growth of 7 to 9 percent. This outlook assumes stable foreign exchange rates and raw material prices for the remainder of the fiscal year and excludes the one-time $1.15 per share benefit related to the company's tax sharing agreement from the adoption of FIN 48.
        For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the company expects sales growth of 6 to 8 percent over prior-year sales of $3.5 billion, with organic sales growth of 1 to 2 percent. The company further expects diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.56 to $0.58, which includes restructuring costs of approximately $0.09 per share. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected to be $0.65 to $0.67, an increase of 12 to 16 percent over the prior-year quarter. This outlook assumes a 35 percent tax rate and Other Income of approximately $10 to $15 million.
        "In the fourth quarter, we again expect double-digit EPS growth and solid cash flow," Lynch said. "Our organic growth outlook reflects some recent softening of order rates in the automotive and telecom service provider markets. We continue to expect solid growth in the majority of our industrial and infrastructure businesses."
SEGMENT RESULTS
        Tyco Electronics is comprised of four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Undersea Telecommunications and Wireless Systems.
Electronic Components
        The Electronic Components segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of passive electronic components, including connectors and interconnect systems, relays, switches, circuit protection devices, touchscreens, sensors, and wire and cable.
        Sales in the segment grew 15 percent year over year, or 6 percent organically. On an organic basis, strong growth in industrial (+23 percent), communications (+10 percent), automotive (+7 percent) and aerospace and defense (+7 percent) markets was partially offset by lower growth in the appliance (+2 percent) market and sales declines in the computer (-2 percent) and consumer electronics (-6 percent) markets. In automotive, growth of 12 percent in markets outside North America more than offset an 18 percent decline in North America.
        Operating income increased by $103 million and adjusted operating income grew $76 million. The adjusted operating margin increased due to higher volumes and productivity improvements, which more than offset increased raw material costs. Restructuring costs in the quarter were $11 million, compared to $18 million of restructuring and $20 million of separation-related costs in the prior-year quarter.
Network Solutions
        The Network Solutions segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of infrastructure components and systems for the communication service provider, building networks and energy markets.
        Segment sales grew 15 percent compared to the prior-year quarter, or 6 percent organically. On an organic basis, sales to the building networks and energy markets grew 15 percent and 5 percent respectively. Sales to the communication service provider market were essentially flat, with strong growth in North America offset by the continuation of slower network investment by certain European telecommunications carriers.
        Operating income decreased by $6 million and adjusted operating income decreased by $9 million. The decrease in the adjusted operating margin primarily relates to a lower-margin sales mix and lower productivity levels. Restructuring costs in the quarter were $4 million, compared to $4 million of restructuring and $3 million of separation-related costs in the prior-year quarter.
Undersea Telecommunications
        The company's Undersea Telecommunications segment is a world leader in developing, manufacturing, installing and maintaining the world's most advanced fiber optic undersea networks.
        Sales in the segment grew 81 percent organically versus the prior year, due to continued investment in undersea fiber optic network capacity, primarily in emerging markets. Adjusted operating income increased $21 million and the adjusted operating margin increased to 14.4 percent, driven by higher volumes and a favorable project mix. Restructuring-related costs in the quarter were $1 million, compared to $2 million of restructuring and $1 million of separation-related costs in the prior-year quarter.
Wireless Systems
        The Wireless Systems segment is a leading innovator of wireless technology for critical communications.
        Sales in the segment grew $40 million versus the prior year, primarily due to increased radio sales related to the federally-mandated re-banding efforts of a customer. Adjusted operating income increased $13 million due to higher sales volumes and a favorable sales mix. There were no Other Items in the quarter, compared to $1 million of restructuring and $1 million of separation-related costs in the prior-year quarter.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
        
"Organic Sales Growth," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Earnings Per Share," "Adjusted Operating Margin," and "Free Cash Flow" (FCF) are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
        
"Organic Sales Growth" is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP
measure) and Organic Sales Growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Organic Sales Growth is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. It is also a component of the company's compensation programs. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's sales. This limitation is best addressed by using organic sales growth in combination with the GAAP numbers. See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of Organic Sales Growth.
        
The company has presented its operating income before unusual items including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Income"). The company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions. It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans. Adjusted Operating Income is a useful measure for investors because it better reflects the company's underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods. The difference between Adjusted Operating Income and operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges related to litigation settlement costs, separation-related costs and restructuring costs and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease the company's reported operating income. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Operating Income in combination with operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
        
The company has presented adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is earnings per share from continuing operations before unusual items, including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs, loss on retirement of debt and other income or charges ("Adjusted Earnings Per Share"). The company presents Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to our results in accordance with GAAP. We believe such a measure provides a picture of our results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of unusual items, which may recur occasionally, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby making comparisons between periods more difficult. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Earnings Per Share in combination with earnings per share (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
        
The company has presented its operating margin before unusual items including costs related to the separation, legal settlements, restructuring costs and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Margin"). The company presents and forecasts its Adjusted Operating Margin before unusual items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results. Because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items and the associated charges or gains that will be recorded in the company's financial statements, it is difficult to include the impact of those items in the forecast.
        
"Free Cash Flow" (FCF) is a useful measure of the company's cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation. The difference between cash flows from operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows that the company believes are useful to identify. FCF permits management and investors to gain
insight into the number that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation. The difference reflects the impact from:
 - 
net capital expenditures,
 - 
voluntary pension contributions, and
 
 - 
cash impact of unusual items.
  
        
Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. The company forecasts its cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contributions because it has not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any future such contributions. In addition, the company's forecast excludes the cash impact of unusual items because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items.
        
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it subtracts cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and that therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure. This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.
        
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period. See the accompanying tables to this press release for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF.
