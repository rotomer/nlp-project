ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS
 
Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the "Company") has tentatively scheduled its 2009 annual general meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held in June 2009.  In addition, the Company has tentatively scheduled a special general meeting of shareholders (the "Special Meeting") to also be held in June 2009.
 
On March 5, 2009, the Company set a record date of April 3, 2009 for the Annual Meeting and a record date of April 6, 2009 for the Special Meeting.
 
The Annual Meeting is being held more than 30 days after the anniversary of the Company's prior annual meeting of shareholders for fiscal 2008 held on March 10, 2008.  As a result of this change in the timing of the Company's annual meeting date, certain notice deadlines provided in the Company's Proxy Statement, dated January 25, 2008, under the heading "Tyco Electronics 2009 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders" have changed.
 
If a shareholder intends to present any proposal for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for either the Annual Meeting or the Special Meeting in accordance with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for consideration at the Annual Meeting or the Special Meeting, the proposal must be received by the Secretary of the Company by no later than March 26, 2009.  Such proposal must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission relating to shareholders' proposals.
 
Notices should be addressed in writing to: Harold G. Barksdale, Secretary, Tyco Electronics Ltd., 96 Pitts Bay Road, Second Floor, Pembroke HM 08 Bermuda.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
