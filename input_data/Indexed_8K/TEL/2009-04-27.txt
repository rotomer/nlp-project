RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
                                      
 
The information disclosed in Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is furnished and incorporated by reference in this Item 2.02.  The financial information referred to therein is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 to this report and incorporated by reference in this Item 2.02.
 
ITEM 7.01
REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
                                      
 
Effective January 1, 2009, Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the "Company") established the Specialty Products Group from its existing businesses.  The results of this new organization will be reported as a separate reporting segment in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 27, 2009. This new segment is comprised of the Medical Products, Circuit Protection, Touch Systems, and Aerospace, Defense, and Marine businesses which were formerly reported in the Electronics Components segment. The Company has reclassified prior period segment results to reflect the new segment reporting structure.
 
The unaudited financial information furnished with this report and incorporated by reference includes the consolidated and combined segment results and the consolidated and combined adjusted income (loss) from operations by segment of the Company for the fiscal quarters ended December 26, 2008, September 26, 2008, June 27, 2008, March 28, 2008, and December 28, 2007, and for the fiscal years ended September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures for adjusted income (loss) from operations by segment.
 
Non-GAAP Measure
 
The Company has presented its income (loss) before unusual items including
restructuring costs, impairment charges and other income or charges ("adjusted income (loss) from operations").  Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results. The Company utilizes adjusted income (loss) from operations to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions.  It is also a significant component in the Company's incentive compensation plans. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a useful measure for investors because it better reflects the Company's underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods.  The difference between adjusted income (loss) from operations and income (loss) from operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges related to litigation settlements, restructuring costs, impairment charges and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease the Company's reported operating income. This limitation is best addressed by using adjusted income (loss) from operations in combination with income (loss) from operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
