SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland  Apr. 28, 2010  Tyco Electronics Ltd.
(NYSE: TEL) today reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended Mar. 26, 2010.  The company reported a net sales increase of 27 percent year-over-year, and 2 percent sequentially, to $2.96 billion.  GAAP EPS were $0.66 for the quarter, compared to a loss per share of $7.07 in the prior-year period.  Included in the GAAP EPS were $0.02 per share of restructuring and other charges and $0.04 per share of income related to tax items.  This compares to $7.21 per share of net charges in the prior-year quarter.  Adjusted EPS were $0.64 in
 
the quarter, compared to $0.14 in the prior-year quarter.
 
"We had an outstanding second quarter," said Tyco Electronics Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch.  "Sales were up 27 percent year-over-year as we capitalized on continued strength in the consumer markets served by our Electronic Components segment.  We improved our adjusted operating margin to 13.9 percent and generated a half billion dollars of cash from operations, with $422 million of free cash flow.
 
"I am encouraged by the strength of demand in most of our end markets and pleased with our progress in improving operating margins.  We now expect sales to be in the $3.0 to $3.1 billion range per quarter for the balance of the year, and expect our operating margins to remain above 13 percent in the second half of the year."
 
The following discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures which are described at the end of this press release.  For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures, see the attached tables.  All dollar amounts are pre-tax and stated in millions.
 
 
Sales grew 27 percent compared to the prior-year quarter and 2 percent sequentially.  Organically, sales increased 23 percent compared to the prior year and 5 percent sequentially.  By segment, and on an organic basis, sales in the Electronic Components segment increased 7 percent sequentially, with broad-based growth in consumer and industrial markets.  Sales in the Specialty Products segment grew 6 percent sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in aerospace and defense and touch systems markets.  Sales declined 1 percent sequentially in the Network Solutions segment due to a seasonal decline in the energy market.  In the Subsea Communications segment, sales increased 4 percent sequentially.
 
The adjusted operating margin improved to 13.9 percent, compared to 11.5 percent in the prior quarter
and 3.1 percent a year ago. The year-over-year operating margin improvement was due to volume increases in Electronic Components, productivity gains, cost reductions initiated in 2009 and a favorable sales mix.
 
CASH FLOW
 
Cash from continuing operations was $500 million during the quarter, compared to $461 million in the year-ago period.  Free cash flow was $422 million, compared to $370 million in the prior-year period.  The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher income levels.
 
ORDERS
 
Total company orders increased 51 percent compared to the prior year and 3 percent sequentially.  The book-to-bill ratio was 1.03 in the quarter.  Excluding the company's Subsea Communications segment, which is a project-oriented business with uneven order patterns, orders increased 56 percent year-over-year and 3 percent sequentially and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.10.
 
ADDITIONAL ITEM
 
At the company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on March 10, 2010, shareholders approved a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share for the four fiscal quarters beginning with the third quarter of 2010, subject to required filings with the Swiss Commercial Register.
 
THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR FISCAL 2010 OUTLOOK
 
For the third quarter, the company expects sales of $3.0 to $3.1 billion, an increase of 20 to 24 percent over the prior-year period.  GAAP operating income is expected to be $365 to $390 million, which includes restructuring and other charges of approximately $30 million.  Adjusted operating income is expected to be $395 to $420 million.  GAAP EPS are expected to be $0.56 to $0.60, including restructuring and other charges of approximately $0.05 per share.  Adjusted EPS are expected to be $0.61 to $0.65, compared to adjusted EPS of $0.17 in the prior-year period.
 
For the full fiscal year, the company expects sales of $11.8 to $12.0 billion, an increase of 15 to 17 percent over the prior year.  GAAP EPS are expected to be $2.12 to $2.20, including restructuring and other charges of approximately $0.20 per share.  Adjusted EPS are expected to be $2.32 to $2.40, compared to adjusted EPS of $0.83 in the prior-year period.  This outlook assumes current foreign exchange rates.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
 
"Organic Sales Growth," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Operating Margin,"
"Adjusted Other Income, Net,"
"Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit,"
"Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations,"  "Adjusted Earnings Per Share," and "Free Cash Flow" (FCF) are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
 
"Organic Sales Growth" is a useful measure used by the company to measure the underlying results and trends in the business.  The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Organic Sales Growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures.  Organic Sales Growth is a useful measure of the company's performance because it excludes items that:  i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of foreign currency exchange; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on the company's sales.  This limitation is best addressed by using organic sales growth in combination with the GAAP results. See the accompanying tables to this press release for the reconciliation presenting the components of Organic Sales Growth.
 
The company has presented its operating income before special items including charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Income").  The company utilizes Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions.  It is also a significant component in the company's incentive compensation plans. Adjusted Operating Income is a useful measure for investors because it better reflects the company's underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between
periods.  The difference between Adjusted Operating Income and operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease the company's reported operating income. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Operating Income in combination with operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
 
The company has presented its operating margin before special items including charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges ("Adjusted Operating Margin").  The company presents Adjusted Operating Margin before special items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results.  Because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items and the associated charges or gains that will be recorded in the company's financial statements, it is difficult to include the impact of those items in the forecast.
 
The company has presented other income, net before special items including tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns ("Adjusted Other Income, Net"). The company presents Adjusted Other Income, Net as it believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to its results in accordance with GAAP. The difference between Adjusted Other Income, Net and other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease other income, net. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Other Income, Net in combination with other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
The company has presented income tax (expense) benefit after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including charges related to restructuring, impairment charges, and other income or charges, and certain significant special tax items ("Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit").  The company presents Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit to provide investors further information regarding the tax effects of adjustments used in determining the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations (as defined below).  The difference between Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and income tax (expense) benefit (the most comparable GAAP measure) is the tax effect of adjusting items and certain significant special tax items.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease income tax (expense) benefit. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit in combination with income tax (expense) benefit (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
The company has presented income from continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. before special items including charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, and, if applicable, related tax effects ("Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations").  The company presents Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations as it believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to its results in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations provides additional information regarding the company's underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods.  The difference between Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and income from continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, and, if applicable, related tax effects.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of
items that would otherwise either increase or decrease the company's reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations in combination with income from continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
The company has presented diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. before special items, including charges related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, and, if applicable, related tax effects ("Adjusted Earnings Per Share"). The company presents Adjusted Earnings Per Share because it believes that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to its results in accordance with GAAP.  The company believes such a measure provides a picture of its results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of special items, which may recur, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby making comparisons between periods more difficult. This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Earnings Per Share in combination with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
 
 "Free Cash Flow" (FCF) is a useful measure of the company's cash generation which is free from any significant existing obligation.  The difference between cash flows from operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows that the company believes are useful to identify.  FCF permits management and investors to gain insight into the amount that management employs to measure cash that is free from any significant existing obligation.  The difference reflects the impact from:
 
                 
net capital expenditures,
                 
voluntary pension contributions, and
                 
cash impact of special items.
 
Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments.  Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity.  The company forecasts its cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contributions because it has not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any future such contributions.  In addition, the company's forecast excludes the cash impact of special items because the company cannot predict the amount and timing of such items.
 
The limitation associated with using FCF is that it subtracts cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and that therefore may imply that there is less or more cash that is available for the company's programs than the most comparable GAAP measure.  This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow results.
 
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.  The measure should be used in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures.  Investors are urged to read the company's financial statements as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the accompanying tables to this press release that show all the elements of the GAAP measures of Cash Flows from Operating Activities, Cash Flows from Investing Activities, Cash Flows from Financing Activities and a reconciliation of the company's total cash and cash equivalents for the period.  See the accompanying tables to this press release for a cash flow statement presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation presenting the components of FCF.
 
Because the company does not predict the amount and timing of special items that might occur in the future, and its forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, the company does not provide reconciliations to GAAP of its forward-looking financial
measures.
