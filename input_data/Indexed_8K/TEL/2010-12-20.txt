ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
On December 20, 2010, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics"), issued an aggregate of $250,000,000 principal amount of its 4.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2021 (the "Notes"), which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment by Tyco Electronics. The Notes were offered and sold by TEGSA pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-152069) (the "Registration Statement").  The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $246.9 million after deducting the underwriters' discount but before other expenses and will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of December 15, 2010, among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and Goldman Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in their capacity as representatives of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters").  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein, TEGSA agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public.  TEGSA sold Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 98.772% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the Notes to the public at a price of 99.422% of the principal amount thereof.
 
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 25, 2007 (the "Indenture"), among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and a Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 20, 2010 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture") among TEGSA, as issuer, Tyco Electronics, as guarantor, and the Trustee. The Trustee will receive customary fees in connection therewith.  The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by Tyco Electronics (the "Guarantee"). The Notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
 
TEGSA may redeem some or all of the Notes at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. TEGSA may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such Notes.
 
The Indenture limits TEGSA's ability to create liens to secure certain indebtedness without also securing the Notes and limits its ability to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. The Indenture also limits TEGSA's and Tyco Electronics' ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.
 
If Tyco Electronics experiences a change of control and, as a result of that change of control, the Notes are rated below investment grade by at least two of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Limited (or the equivalent under any successor rating categories of Standard and Poor's, Moody's or Fitch's, respectively), and TEGSA has not redeemed such notes, TEGSA will offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
 
The following are events of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes:
 
                 
default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any Notes, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
                 
default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of or premium, if any, on any of the Notes; or
 
                 
default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of Tyco Electronics or TEGSA in respect of the Notes and the guarantee (other than the failure to comply with any covenant or agreement to file with the trustee the information filed or required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a default or breach specifically dealt with elsewhere), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days; or
                 
the guarantee shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by Tyco Electronics or TEGSA not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms except to the extent contemplated by the Indenture and the guarantee; or
                 
a court shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of TEGSA or Tyco Electronics in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
                 
TEGSA or Tyco Electronics shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; or
                 
an event of default shall happen and be continuing with respect to TEGSA's or Tyco Electronics' indebtedness for borrowed money under any indenture or other instrument evidencing or under which TEGSA or Tyco Electronics shall have a principal amount outstanding in excess of $100,000,000 and such event of default shall involve the failure to pay the principal of such indebtedness on the final maturity date thereof after expiration of any grace period or in certain circumstances involving acceleration of the indebtedness such that the principal shall become due and payable prior to the date on which it otherwise would be due and payable.
 
The foregoing descriptions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Underwriting Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 hereto, to the full text of the Indenture which is filed as Exhibit 4.1(a) to Tyco Electronics' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2007, filed on December 14, 2007 and to the full text of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto.

The Guarantor maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act; such disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to the Guarantor is made known to the Guarantor's principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Guarantor periodically reviews the effect of Environmental Laws on its business, operations and properties, in the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated costs and liabilities (including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required for clean-up,
 
closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities and any potential liabilities to third parties); on the basis of such review, the Guarantor has reasonably concluded that such associated costs and liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.

Except as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, neither the Guarantor nor, to its knowledge, any subsidiary has received any written notice of infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any of the Intellectual Property Rights, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Except as described in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, no executive officer or director of the Company, the Guarantor or of any Significant Subsidiary is aware of or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "FCPA"), including, without limitation, making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any money, or other property, g ift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Pro spectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, or
any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notif y the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agree s to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsect ion (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untr ue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchasing obligations and not joint.
 
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and condition s, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, within the meaning of the Act.

(a)
                                 
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Und erwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than  seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantor agree to prepare promptly any amendments to the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term
"Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
                                
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pr o rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
                                 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the p art of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.
                                
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and paym ent for the Securities.
 
12.
                                
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company or the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the S ecurities, but neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13.
                                
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you by the Representatives.  All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail,

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securitiesfrom any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
 
16.
                                
Each of the Company and the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Guarantor, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) each of the Company and the Guarantor has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriter, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17.
                                
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company or the Guarantor and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18.
                                
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.
                                
The Company, the Guarantor and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.
                                
Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or United States Federal court sitting in The City of New York over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. To the extent that the Company or the Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity (on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise) from the jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process with respect to itself or its property, each of the Company and the Guarantor irrevocably waives, to the full extent permitted by law, such immunity in respect of any such suit, action or proceeding. Each of the Company and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation System, with offices at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding described in the preceding paragraph and agrees that service of process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be made upon it at the office of such agent.

21.
                                
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the purchasers could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from either of them to any Underwri ter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency. If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter against such loss.  If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, such Underw riter or controlling person of such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder.

This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and the Guarantor are authorized to disclose to any and all persons, the tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company or the Guarantor relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind.

ANNEX I
 
December 15, 2010
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and BofA Merrill Lynch
As Representatives of the several Underwriters
for the offering of US $XXX,XXX,XXX X.X% Senior Notes
due XXXX of Tyco Electronics Group S.A. fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd.
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 24, 2010, the related financial statement schedule, and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2010.  The Company's consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and our report thereon and our report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting are included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 24, 2010, and incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-152069) on Form S - -3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act).  The registration statement and the preliminary prospectus supplement dated December 15, 2010 are herein referred to as the registration statement.
 
In connection with the registration statement
 
1.
             
We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB").
 
2.
             
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by us and incorporated by reference in the registration statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
3.
             
We have not audited any financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 24, 2010; although we have conducted an audit for the year ended September 24, 2010, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of September 24, 2010, and for the year then ended, but not on the Company's financial statements for any interim period within that year.
 
4.
             
For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2010 minutes of the meetings of the board of directors, the audit committee, and the compensation committee of the Company and its subsidiaries as set forth in the minutes books at December 13, 2010, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein except for the meetings that occurred on November 30,
 
2010 and December 1, 2010; we have carried out other procedures to December 13, 2010, as follows (our work did not extend to the period from December 14, 2010 to December 15, 2010, inclusive):
 
a.
             
With respect to the period from September 25, 2010, to December 13, 2010, we have
 
(i)
                                    
Read the unaudited consolidated financial information of the Company and subsidiaries for October and November of 2010 furnished us by the Company, officials of the Company having advised us that no such financial information as of any date or for any period subsequent to November 26, 2010, were available. The financial information for October and November is incomplete in that it omits the statements of cash flows and other disclosures.
 
(ii)
                                 
Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited consolidated financial information referred to in a(i) are stated on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in the registration statement.
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph. Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
5.
             
Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to
believe that
 
a.
                                     
At November 26, 2010, there was any change in the common shares, increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated total current assets or shareholders' equity of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown in the September 24, 2010 consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the registration statement except for a decrease in consolidated total current assets of $121 million, or
 
b.
                                     
For the period from September 25, 2010 to November 26, 2010, there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or operating income, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
6.
             
As mentioned in 4a(i), Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to November 26, 2010, are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after November 26, 2010, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at December 13, 2010, there was any change in the common shares, increase in long-term debt, or any decreases in consolidated total current assets or shareholders' equi ty of the consolidated companies as compared with amounts shown on the September 24, 2010, consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference into the registration statement or (b) for the period from September 25, 2010, to December 13, 2010 there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or operating income. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, we noted that
a.
             
Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the balance of common shares (after rounding to the nearest million) changed during the period, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
b.
             
Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was an increase in total long-term debt during the period, excluding the assumption of ADC Telecommunications, Inc. debt, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur.
 
c.
              
Officials of the Company have informed us that (a) although they recognize that they recently completed the acquisition of ADC Telecommunications, Inc. on December 8, 2010, they are unable to comment as to whether there has been any decrease in consolidated total current assets or shareholders' equity of the consolidated companies as of December 13, 2010 as compared with the amounts shown in the September 24, 2010 consolidated balance sheet, as no related consolidated financial data as of December 13, 2010 is available, and (b) they are unable to comment as to whether there has been any decrease in consolidated net sales or operating income of the consolidated companies for the period November 26, 2010 to December 13, 2010, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, as no related consolidated financial data for the periods indicated are available.
 
7.
             
For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached excerpts of documents incorporated by reference in the registration statement and have performed the following procedures which were applied, as indicated with respect to the symbols explained below. For purposes of these procedures, rounding indicates that whole numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand, million or billion, as the context would indicate, in the attached documents.
 
A.
           
Compared the amounts or percentages identified as (A) to the corresponding amounts or percentages shown in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the periods indicated and found them to be in agreement, after rounding, as applicable.
