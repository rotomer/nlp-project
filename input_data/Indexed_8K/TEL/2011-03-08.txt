        As previously reported, at the annual general meeting of Tyco Electronics Ltd. (the "Company") held on March 10, 2010, the Company's shareholders approved the equivalent of a dividend payment in the form of a distribution to shareholders through a reduction of par value of 0.72 Swiss francs (CHF) per share payable in four equal installments on or before March 25, 2011 (the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2011). The first installment of the distribution was paid on June 16, 2010 to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on June 8, 2010. The second installment of the distribution was paid on September 15, 2010 to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on September 7, 2010. The third installment of the distribution was paid on December 15, 2010 to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2010. The fourth installment of the distribution will be paid in US dollars equal to US$0.16 per share on or about March 16, 2011 to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2011.
        The Company's amended and restated Articles of Association, reflecting the fourth installment of the par value reduction of CHF 0.18 per share, became effective upon their filing with the commercial register of the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland on March 8, 2011 and, as a result, the par value of each share of the Company is now CHF 1.37.
