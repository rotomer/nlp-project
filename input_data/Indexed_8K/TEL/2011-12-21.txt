Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On December 20, 2011, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TE Connectivity Ltd. (the "Company"), as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, the lenders parties thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement which provides for revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $700 million (the "Credit Agreement"). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the commitments will be reduced upon certain events, including the receipt of proceeds from the incurrence of certain types of debt for borrowed money by the Company, TEGSA or their subsidiaries, certain equity issuances by the Company, TEGSA or their subsidiaries and certain dispositions.
 
In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, also on December 20, 2011, the Bridge Commitment Letter that was filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 29, 2011, automatically terminated in accordance with its terms.
 
The Credit Agreement is unsecured, has a 364-day term, and matures on December 18, 2012. Amounts may be borrowed in U.S. dollars for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes and other lawful corporate purposes, including repayment of debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, acquisitions and equity repurchases. TEGSA's obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company. No proceeds from the Credit Agreement were drawn at closing.
 
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. New York Branch's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA.
 
The Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon (1) the amount of the lenders' commitments under the credit facility from time to time and (2) the applicable corporate credit ratings of TEGSA. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements.
 
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes are usual and customary for unsecured credit agreements, including a financial covenant requiring the maintenance of a 3.5 to 1.0 or lower leverage ratio, which is the ratio of the Company's consolidated total debt to its consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement.
 
The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations (each of which is subject to customary exceptions for financings of this type) on our ability to:
 
      grant liens;
      enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of TEGSA or the Company);
      restrict subsidiary dividends or other subsidiary distributions;
      enter into transactions with the Company's affiliates;
      permit subsidiaries to provide guarantees of other material debt; and
      incur certain additional subsidiary debt.
 
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the representations or warranties in any material respect; breach of the financial, affirmative or negative covenants; payment default on, or acceleration of, other material indebtedness; bankruptcy or insolvency; material judgments entered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain specified events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain changes in control of TEGSA or the Company; and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or other documents associated with the Credit Agreement.
This description of the Credit Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Credit Agreement. A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(e)           either Obligor shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (other than those specified in clause (a), (b) or (d) of this Article), and such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after notice thereof from the Administrative Agent to the Guarantor (which notice will be given at the request of any Lender);
 
(f)            the Guarantor or any Subsidiary shall fail to make any payment in respect of any Material Debt, when and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall continue beyond any applicable grace period (but in any event, in the case of interest, fees or other amounts other than principal, for a period of at least five Business Days);
 
(g)           any event or condition occurs that results in any Material Debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity; that this clause (g) shall not apply to (i) any Debt of the Borrower or a Subsidiary that is purchased in the open market or directly from holders of such Debt in the normal course of managing the Consolidated capital structure of the Guarantor and such Debt is cancelled by the Borrower or such Subsidiary immediately upon the settlement of such purchase, (ii) secured Debt that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale or transfer of the property or assets securing such Debt, (iii) any conversion, purchase, repurchase or redemption of any Material Debt scheduled by the terms thereof to occur on a particular date, or as a result of any customary required offer by the Guarantor or any Subsidiary to purchase such Debt, such as upon a change of control, (iv) any conversion of any Material Debt initiated by a holder thereof pursuant to the terms thereof or any optional prepayment, repurchase or redemption of any Material Debt, in each case not subject to any contingent event or condition related to the creditworthiness, financial performance or financial condition of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary, (v) any repurchase or redemption of any Material Debt pursuant to any put option exercised by the holder of such Material Debt, that such put option is exercisable at times specified in the terms of the Material Debt and not by its terms solely as a result of any contingent event or condition related to the creditworthiness, financial performance or financial condition of the Guarantor or the applicable Subsidiaries, or (vi) the cancellation and resulting payment of any amounts outstanding under any credit or similar facility of an acquired Subsidiary, which was outstanding prior to such acquisition, and not created in contemplation of such acquisition, other than as a result of a default under any such facility occurring after, and not in connection with, such acquisition;

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the entity named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to serve as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
 
The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.  Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Guarantor or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
 
(a)           the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing
(and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties);
(b)           the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02); that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or is contrary to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or applicable law; and
provided
 
(c)           the Administrative Agent shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (with such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment).  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.
 
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (b) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (c) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (d) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (e) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent also may rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and may act upon any such statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
 
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned or be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a commercial bank with an office in the United States of America, or an Affiliate of any such commercial bank with an office in the United States of America.  If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this paragraph.  Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph).  The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.  After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
provided
 
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or the Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or the Arranger or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under such Subsidiary Guarantor's Subsidiary Guaranty (a) if such Person ceases to exist or to be a Subsidiary (or substantially contemporaneously with such release will cease to exist or to be a Subsidiary), in each case as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder, or (b) otherwise in accordance with Section 4.06(b) of the relevant Subsidiary Guaranty.
 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the Persons named as the Arranger or the Syndication Agent on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a Lender hereunder.
 
SECTION 8.01.            .  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment in cash when due (whether at stated maturity, by mandatory prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever at any time or from time to time payable or becoming payable under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.  This is a continuing guarantee and a guarantee of payment and not merely of collection.  Upon failure by the Borrower to pay punctually any such amount when due as aforesaid, the Guarantor shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement.
The Guarantee
 
SECTION 8.02.            .  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall be unconditional and absolute, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected, at any time by:
Guarantee Unconditional
 
(a)           any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document, by operation of law or otherwise;
 
(b)           any modification or amendment of or supplement to any Loan Document;
 
(c)           any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct or indirect security for any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document;
(d)           any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of the Guarantor or the Borrower contained in any Loan Document;
 
(e)           the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions, that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;
provided
 
(f)            any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against the Borrower for any reason of any Loan Document, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by the Borrower, in the currency and funds and at the time and place specified herein, of any amount payable by it under any Loan Document; or
 
(g)           any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety.
 
SECTION 8.03.            .  The guarantee and other agreements in this Article VIII shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal of and interest on the Loans, the Notes and all other amounts whatsoever payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall have been finally paid in full.  If at any time any payment of any such amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reimbursement in Certain Circumstances
 
SECTION 8.04.            .  The Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the Borrower or any other Person.
Waiver by the Guarantor
 
SECTION 8.05.            .  Upon making any payment hereunder with respect to the Borrower, all rights of the Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against the Borrower with respect to such payment; that the Guarantor shall not enforce any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document has been finally paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated.
Subrogation
provided
 
SECTION 8.06.            .  In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is stayed upon insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor hereunder forthwith on demand by the Required Lenders.
Stay of Acceleration
SECTION 8.07.            .  All payments made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Article VIII shall be made as provided under Section 2.12(a), and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 9.05.
Payments
 
SECTION 9.01.            .  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest
 
(a)           the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
 
(b)           the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period (together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05) will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
 
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective, and such Borrowing shall be continued as an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.  In the case of clause (b) above, during any such period of suspension each Lender shall, from time to time upon request from the Borrower, certify its cost of funds for each Interest Period to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than 10 Business Days after any such request).
 
SECTION 9.02.            .  Notwithstanding any other provision of any Loan Document, if any Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent (and provide to the Borrower an opinion of counsel to the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its lending office for Eurodollar Borrowings to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans hereunder, (a) each Eurodollar Loan of such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, convert into an ABR Loan that bears interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.10(a) and (b) the obligation of such Lender to make or continue, or to convert ABR Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and such Lender that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and such Lender shall make the ABR Loans in the amount and on the dates that it would have been requested to make Eurodollar Loans had no such suspension been in effect.
Illegality
 
SECTION 9.03.            .  (a)  If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
(i)            impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or
 
(ii)           impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting any Loan Document or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;
 
(iii)          subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing has been to increase the cost to such Lender or the Administrative Agent of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or, in the case of clause (iii) above, any Loan), or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) (excluding any such increased costs resulting from reserve commitments referred to in paragraph (c) of this Section 9.03), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Administrative Agent such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Administrative Agent for such additional costs or expenses incurred or reduction suffered.
 
(b)           If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of any Loan Document or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time within 30 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06) the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
 
(c)           At any time that any Lender is required to establish or maintain reserves in respect of its Eurodollar Loans under FRB Regulation D, such Lender may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on a Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, additional interest on such Eurodollar Loan at a rate per annum determined by such Lender be sufficient to compensate it for the cost to it of maintaining, or the reduction in its total return in respect of, such Eurodollar Loan, up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (B) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, minus (ii) the applicable LIBO Rate.  Any Lender wishing to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the Eurodollar Loans of such Lender shall be payable to such Lender at the time and place indicated at which interest otherwise is payable on such Eurodollar Loan, with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least three Business Days after the giving of such
notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Business Days prior to each date on which interest is payable on the Eurodollar Loans of the amount then due it under this paragraph (c).
 
(d)           Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 9.03 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if a the Change in Law occurring during the 90-day period referred to above and giving rise to such increased costs or expense or reduction is retroactive, then such 90-day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 9.04.            .  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any oral or written notice given pursuant hereto (whether or not such notice may be revoked in accordance with the terms hereof) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.04(e), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (including any loss or expense arising from the redeployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Eurodollar Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained, but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) within 10 days of written demand therefor (subject to Section 9.06).
Break Funding Payments
 
SECTION 9.05.            .  (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Guarantor or the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if the Guarantor or the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 9.05) the Administrative Agent or applicable Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Guarantor or the Borrower, as applicable, shall make such deductions and (iii) the Guarantor or the Borrower, as applicable, shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 9.05) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to a Governmental Authority by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall deliver to the Borrower the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower.
 
(d)           Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Guarantor or the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Guarantor and the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.04(c)(iii) relating to the maintenance of a ParticipantRegister and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (d).
 
(e)           As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Guarantor or the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Guarantor or the Borrower, as applicable, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
 
(f)            Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of United States withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Guarantor or the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Guarantor or the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
 
(g)           If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its good faith judgment, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Guarantor or the Borrower or with respect to which the Guarantor or the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 9.05, it shall pay over such refund to the Guarantor or the Borrower, as applicable (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Guarantor or the Borrower under this Section 9.05 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by
the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); that the Guarantor and the Borrower agrees, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, to repay the amount paid over to the Guarantor or the Borrower, as applicable (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  This Section 9.05 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Guarantor, the Borrower or any other Person.
provided
 
SECTION 9.06.            .  If any Lender or the Administrative Agent is claiming compensation under Section 9.03, 9.04 or 9.05, it shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, who shall deliver to the Borrower contemporaneously with the demand for payment, a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of any additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and the basis used to determine such amounts and such certificate shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  In determining such amount, such Lender or the Administrative Agent may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.  In any such certificate claiming compensation under Section 9.03(b), such Lender shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.  This Section 9.06 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Guarantor, the Borrower or any other Person.
Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation
 
SECTION 9.07.            .  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 9.03, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 9.05, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03 or 9.05, as the case may be, in the future and (b) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

SECTION 10.02.          .  (a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Guarantor, the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 10.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

Indemnitee
 
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries; that (A) such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment and (B) in the case of legal fees and expenses, such indemnity shall be limited to one counsel for all Indemnitees taken as a whole and, solely in the case of a conflict of interest (as reasonably determined or perceived by the affected Indemnitees), one additional counsel for all affected Indemnitees (or similarly situated affected Indemnitees), in either case taken as a whole (and, if determined by the Administrative Agent to be reasonably necessary, of one local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction for all Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and, solely in the case of a conflict of interest (as reasonably determined or perceived by the affected Indemnitees), one additional local counsel for all affected Indemnitees (or similarly affected Indemnitees), in either case taken as a whole).  If any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is asserted against any Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law or regulation in the opinion of its counsel, notify the Borrower as soon as reasonably practicable, but the failure to so promptly notify the Borrower shall not affect the Borrower's obligations under this Section 10.03.  If requested by the Borrower in writing, and at the Borrower's sole expense, such Indemnitee shall make reasonable good faith efforts to contest the validity, applicability and amount of such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding and, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or regulations or as would otherwise be unreasonable in the circumstances or contrary to the internal policies of the Indemnitee as generally applied, shall permit the Borrower to participate in such contest.  Any Indemnitee that proposes to settle or compromise any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding for which the Borrower may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give the Borrower written notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain the Borrower's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; that the foregoing shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower or the Guarantor to indemnify any Indemnitee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the Transactions.

If the Guarantor so elects to terminate this Subsidiary Guaranty, it shall give the Administrative Agent notice to such effect, which notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer to the effect that, after giving effect to such termination, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.  The Administrative Agent may conclusively rely on such certificate.  Upon receipt of such notice and such certificate, unless the Administrative Agent determines that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver to the Guarantor the counterpart of this Subsidiary Guaranty delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 4.06(a), and upon such delivery this Subsidiary Guaranty shall terminate and the Guarantor shall have no further obligations hereunder.  In addition to the foregoing, this Subsidiary Guaranty may be terminated and released in accordance with the terms of the penultimate paragraph of Article VII of the Credit Agreement.
 
SECTION 4.07           Right of Setoff

account of the Guarantor against any and all of the obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under any Loan Documents to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under such Loan Document and although such obligations of the Guarantor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness.  The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 4.07 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Guarantor and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.
