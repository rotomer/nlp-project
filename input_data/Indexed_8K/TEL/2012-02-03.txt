Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 3, 2012, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TE Connectivity Ltd. ("TE Connectivity"), issued $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.600% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment by TE Connectivity. The Notes were offered and sold by TEGSA pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-171800) (the "Registration Statement").  The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes were approximately $743.5 million after deducting the underwriters' discount but before other expenses, and will be used for general corporate purposes, which includes funding a portion of the previously announced purchase of the outstanding share capital of Deutsch Group SAS and the repayment of debt, including TEGSA's outstanding 6.00% senior notes due October 1, 2012 at their maturity.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of January 31, 2012, among TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as guarantor, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., in their capacity as representatives of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters").  Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein, TEGSA agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public.  TEGSA sold the 2015 Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 99.446% of the principal amount thereof and the Underwriters offered the 2015 Notes to the public at a price of 99.796% of the principal amount thereof. TEGSA sold the 2022 Notes to the Underwriters at an issue price of 98.982% of the principal amount thereof and the Underwriters offered the 2022 Notes to the public at a price of 99.607% of the principal amount thereof.
 
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 25, 2007 (the "Indenture"), among TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented (i) with respect to the 2015 Notes, by a Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 3, 2012 (the "Sixth Supplemental Indenture") and (ii) with respect to the 2022 Notes, by a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 3, 2012 (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture") each among TEGSA, as issuer, TE Connectivity, as guarantor, and the Trustee. The Trustee will receive customary fees in connection therewith.  The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity (the "Guarantees"). The Notes of each series are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior debt, including each other series of Notes, and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur.
 
TEGSA may redeem some or all of the 2015 Notes at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the 2015 Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to November 3, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), TEGSA may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes and a make-whole price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after November 3, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), TEGSA may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes at its option at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but excluding, the redemption date. TEGSA may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain tax changes affecting such Notes.
 
The Indenture limits TEGSA's ability to create liens to secure certain indebtedness without also securing the Notes and limits its ability to enter into sale and lease-back transactions. The Indenture also limits TEGSA's and TE Connectivity's ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.
 
If TE Connectivity experiences a change of control and, as a result of that change of control, the Notes of a series are rated below investment grade by at least two of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Limited (or the equivalent under any successor rating categories of Standard and Poor's, Moody's or Fitch's, respectively), and TEGSA has not redeemed such series of Notes, TEGSA will offer to repurchase all of the Notes of that series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
The following are events of default under the Indenture with respect to each series of Notes:
 
     
default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any such Notes, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
 
     
default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of or premium, if any, on any of such Notes; or
 
     
default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of TE Connectivity or TEGSA in respect of such Notes and the related Guarantees (other than the failure to comply with any covenant or agreement to file with the trustee the information filed or required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a default or breach specifically dealt with elsewhere), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days; or
 
     
the Guarantees shall for any reason cease to be, or shall for any reason be asserted in writing by TE Connectivity or TEGSA not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with their terms except to the extent contemplated by the Indenture and such Guarantees; or
 
     
a court shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of TEGSA or TE Connectivity in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
 
     
TEGSA or TE Connectivity shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; or
 
     
an event of default shall happen and be continuing with respect to TEGSA's or TE Connectivity's indebtedness for borrowed money under any indenture or other instrument evidencing or under which TEGSA or TE Connectivity shall have a principal amount outstanding in excess of $100,000,000 and such event of default shall involve the failure to pay the principal of such indebtedness on the final maturity date thereof after expiration of any grace period or in certain circumstances involving acceleration of the indebtedness such that the principal shall become due and payable prior to the date on which it otherwise would be due and payable.

Item 1.02.  Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

Morgan Securities LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as syndication agent, automatically terminated pursuant to Section 2.06 thereof, and the Credit Agreement is no longer effective as of February 3, 2012.

(a)
                                 
The Company and the Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company and the Guarantor shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b)
                                
Each Underwriter severally and not jointly will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or the Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or the Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c)
                                 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection.  In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d)
                                
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantor bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchasing obligations and not joint.
(e)
                                 
The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any affiliate of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor, as the case may be, within the meaning of the Act.
10.
                                
(a)
                                 
If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein.  If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms.  In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company and the Guarantor agree to prepare promptly any amendments to the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary.  The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b)
                                
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c)
                                 
If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Guarantor, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11.
                                
The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantor and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Guarantor, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company or the Guarantor, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12.
                                
If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company or the Guarantor will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall then be under further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13.
                                
In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by you by the Representatives.  All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to you as the Representatives in care of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, Attention:  Debt Capital Markets Syndicate, Facsimile:  (212) 469-7875, with a copy to General Counsel, Facsimile:  (212) 797-4561, and J.P.

This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Guarantor and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and the Guarantor and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

Each of the Company and the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities and the Guarantees pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Guarantor, (iii) no
Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or the Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Guarantor on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) each of the Company and the Guarantor has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.  Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriter, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17.
                                
This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company or the Guarantor and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
18.
                                
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
 
19.
                                
The Company, the Guarantor and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
20.

21.
                                
If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder into any currency other than United States dollars, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the purchasers could purchase United States dollars with such other currency in The City of New York on the business day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of the Company and the Guarantor with respect to any sum due from either of them to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than
 
United States dollars, not be discharged until the first business day following receipt by such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter of any sum in such other currency, and only to the extent that such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase United States dollars with such other currency.  If the United States dollars so purchased are less than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, the Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter against such loss.  If the United States dollars so purchased are greater than the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder, such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter agrees to pay to the Guarantor an amount equal to the excess of the dollars so purchased over the sum originally due to such Underwriter or controlling person of such Underwriter hereunder.

This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC As Representatives of the several Underwriters for the offering of US $[XXX,XXX,XXX] [X.XXX]% Senior Notes due 2015 and US $[XXX,XXX,XXX] [X.XXX]% due 2022 of Tyco Electronics Group S.A. fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity Ltd.
 
c/o Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. 60 Wall Street New York, NY 10005
 
c/o J.P. Morgan Securities LLC 363 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10179
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2011, the related financial statement schedule, and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011.  The Company's consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and our report thereon and our report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting are included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2011, and incorporated by reference in the registration statement (No. 333-171800) on Form S-3 filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act).  The registration statement and the preliminary prospectus supplement dated January 31, 2012 are herein referred to as the registration statement.
 
In connection with the registration statement
 
1.
                   
We are an independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB").
 
2.
                                      
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule audited by us and incorporated by reference in the registration statement comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
3.
                                      
We have not audited any consolidated financial statements of the Company as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 30, 2011; although we have conducted an audit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, the purpose (and therefore the scope) of the audit was to enable us to express our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2011, and for the fiscal year then ended, but not on the Company's financial statements for any interim period within that fiscal year.  Therefore, we are unable to and do not express any opinion on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2011, and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended December 30, 2011 and December 24, 2010, included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2011, incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of any date or for any period subsequent to September 30, 2011.

For purposes of this letter, we have read the 2011 and 2012 minutes of the meetings of the board of directors, the audit committee, and the compensation committee of the Company and its subsidiaries as set forth in the minute books at January 27, 2012, officials of the Company having advised us that the minutes of all such meetings through that date were set forth therein except for the meetings that occurred on January 11, 2012 and January 24, 2012; we have carried out other procedures to January 27, 2012, as follows (our work did not extend to the period from January 28, 2012 to January 31, 2012, inclusive):
 
(a)
                                 
With respect to the three-month periods ended December 30, 2011 and December 24, 2010, we have
 
(i)
                                    
Performed the procedures specified by the PCAOB for a review of interim financial information as described in PCAOB AU 722, , on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for these periods, described in 3, included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 30, 2011, incorporated by reference in the registration statement.
Interim Financial Information
 
(ii)
                                 
Inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information referred to in a. (i) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
The foregoing procedures do not constitute an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
 
Also, they would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments in the following paragraph.  Accordingly, we make no representations about the sufficiency of the foregoing procedures for your purposes.
 
5.
                                      
Nothing came to our attention as a result of the foregoing procedures, however, that caused us to believe that
 
(a)
                                 
Any material modifications should be made to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements described in 3, incorporated by reference in the registration statement, for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
(b)
                                
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements described in 3 do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.
 
6.
                                      
Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial statements as of any date or for any period subsequent to December 30, 2011, are available:  accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after December 30, 2011, have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the periods referred to in 4.  We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters whether (a) at January 27, 2012, there was any change in the common shares, increase in debt, or any decreases in consolidated total current assets or shareholders' equity as compared with amounts shown on the December 30, 2011, unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference into the registration statement or (b) for the period from December 31, 2011, to January 27, 2012 there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in consolidated net sales or operating income.  On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in 4, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change, increase, or decrease, except in all instances for changes, increases, or decreases that the registration statement discloses have occurred or may occur except 
 
(a)
                                 
The maturity value (face amount) of commercial paper has increased to $408 million as of January 27 from $179 million as of December 30, 2011.
 
7.
                                      
For purposes of this letter, we have also read the items identified by you on the attached excerpts of documents incorporated by reference in the registration statement and have performed the following procedures which were applied, as indicated with respect to the symbols explained below.  For purposes of these procedures, rounding indicates that whole numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand, million or billion, as the context would indicate, in the attached documents.
 
Compared the amounts or percentages identified as (A) to the corresponding amounts and percentages, or recalculated the identified percentages based on amounts, shown in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the periods indicated and found them to be in agreement, after rounding, as applicable.
 
Compared the amounts or percentages identified as (B) to the corresponding amounts and percentages, or recalculated the identified percentages based on amounts, shown in the
 
Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes for the periods indicated and found them to be in agreement, after rounding, as applicable.
 
Compared the amounts or percentages identified as (C) to the corresponding amounts or percentages shown on a schedule provided by the Company, derived from underlying accounting records, and found them to be in agreement, after rounding, as applicable.  It should be understood that (1) we make no representations regarding the Company's determination and presentation of the non-GAAP measures of organic revenue, and (2) the non-GAAP measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
 
8.
                                      
Our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the periods referred to in the introductory paragraph of this letter comprised audit tests and procedures deemed necessary for the purpose of expressing an opinion on such financial statements taken as a whole.  For none of the periods referred to therein, or any other period, did we perform audit tests for the purpose of expressing an opinion on individual balances of accounts or summaries of selected transactions such as those enumerated above and, accordingly, we express no opinion thereon.
 
9.
                                      
It should be understood that we make no representations regarding questions of legal interpretation or regarding the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in paragraph 7; also, such procedures would not necessarily reveal any material misstatement of the amounts or percentages listed above.  Further, we have addressed ourselves solely to the foregoing data as set forth in the registration statement and make no representations regarding the adequacy of disclosure or regarding whether any material facts have been omitted.
 
10.
                                
This letter is solely for the information of the addressees and to assist the underwriters in conducting and documenting their investigation of the affairs of the Company in connection with the offering of the securities covered by the registration statement, and it is not to be used, circulated, quoted, or otherwise referred to within or without the underwriting group for any purpose, including but not limited to the registration, purchase, or sale of securities, nor is it to be filed with or referred to in whole or in part in the registration statement or any other document, except that reference may be made to it in the underwriting agreement or in any list of closing documents pertaining to the offering of the securities covered by the registration statement.
 
Yours truly,
ANNEX II
 
The opinion of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, outside counsel for the Company and the Guarantor, to be delivered pursuant to Section 8(c) of the Underwriting Agreement shall be to the effect that:

The execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantor of the Underwriting Agreement, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, the Notes, and the Guarantees, as the case may be, and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations thereunder and under the Base Indenture will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document listed on Schedule A hereto; or (ii) the laws of the State of New York or any federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or Blue Sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph).
 
2.
              
The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.  Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
 
3.
              
The Notes when duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authentication by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
4.
              
The Guarantees, when duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Guarantor and, assuming due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity), and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
5.
              
No consent, approval, waiver, license or authorization or other action by or filing with any federal or New York corporate governmental authority is required in connection with the execution and delivery by the Company and the Guarantor of the Underwriting Agreement, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and the consummation by the Company and the Guarantor of the transactions contemplated thereby or the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations thereunder and under the Base Indenture, except for those in connection with federal and state securities or Blue Sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph, and those already obtained or made.
6.
              
The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes and the Guarantees", "Benefit Plan Investor Considerations" and "Underwriting" insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters, documents or proceedings referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents and proceedings and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.  The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Luxemburg, Switzerland and U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as they constitute summaries of matters of U.S. federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
 
7.
              
Neither the Company nor the Guarantor is, and following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement neither will be, required to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
8.
              
The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and we are not aware of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
 
9.
              
Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to our attention which cause us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, each as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, does not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, (ii) the Registration Statement (including the Incorporated Documents), as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (iii) the Time of Sale Prospectus (including any Incorporated Documents), as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iv) the Prospectus (including the Incorporated Documents), as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement or as of the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

1.5
                                
The execution and delivery by the Company, as well as the issuance of the Securities and the compliance with the terms and conditions, of the Opinion Documents do not (as a matter of Luxembourg law) contravene any applicable law or regulation of Luxembourg and do not contravene or constitute a default under the Articles or, to our best knowledge and relying on the statements made in the Director's Certificate, under any agreement or instrument governing debt of the Company or any other material agreement, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the Company.

We have acted as counsel to TE Connectivity Ltd., a Swiss corporation ("TE Connectivity"), and Tyco Electronics Group S.A., a Luxembourg company ("TEGSA" and together with TE Connectivity, the "Companies"), in connection with the offer and sale by TEGSA of $250,000,000 million aggregate principal amount of 1.600% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $500,000,000 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2012 (the "Agreement"), among the Companies and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein.  The Notes are being issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 25, 2007 (the "Base Indenture") among the Companies and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented (i) with respect to the 2015 Notes, by the Sixth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 3, 2012 (the "Sixth Supplemental Indenture") and (ii) with respect to the 2022 Notes, by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February 3, 2012 (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture"). The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental Indenture and the Seventh Supplemental Indenture is collectively referred to herein as the "Indenture." TEGSA's obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity and such guarantees (the "Guarantees") are set forth in the Indenture and evidenced by notations on the Notes.
 
In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-171800), filed by the Companies on January 21, 2011 (the "Registration Statement"); (ii) the

We refer to the Base Prospectus as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement as the "Prospectus."
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.  We have also assumed (i) the valid existence of each of the Companies, (ii) that each of the Companies has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees, as applicable, and (iii) the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Notes and the Guarantees by each of the Companies, as applicable.  As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of each of the Companies.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1.             The Notes have been duly and validly executed and delivered by TEGSA and, when authenticated by the Trustee, will constitute valid and binding obligations of TEGSA, enforceable against it in accordance with their terms.
 
2.             The Guarantees have been duly and validly executed and delivered by TE Connectivity and, upon authentication of the Notes by the Trustee, will constitute valid and binding obligations of TE Connectivity, enforceable against TE Connectivity in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinions expressed above with respect to validity, binding effect and enforceability are subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).
 
The opinions expressed herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

QUALIFICATIONS
 
The foregoing opinion is subject to the following qualifications.
 
Luxembourg legal concepts are expressed in English terms and not in their original French or German terms. The concepts concerned may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions. It should be noted that there are always irreconcilable differences between languages making it impossible to guarantee a totally accurate translation or interpretation.
 
In particular, there are always some legal concepts which exist in one jurisdiction and not in another, and in those cases it is bound to be difficult to provide a completely satisfactory translation or interpretation because the vocabulary is missing from the language. We accept no responsibility for omissions or inaccuracies to the extent that any are attributable to such factors.
 
This opinion is as of this date and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion or advise of changes hereafter occurring.
 
We express no opinion as to any matters other than those expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is, or may be, implied or inferred herefrom.
 
This legal opinion is given on the express basis, accepted by each person who is entitled to rely on it, that this legal opinion and all rights, obligations or liability in relation to it are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, Luxembourg law and that any action or claim in relation to it can only be brought before the courts of Luxembourg.
 
This opinion is given for your benefit only. It may not be relied upon by or disclosed to any other person, quoted, referred to or otherwise used (save as required by law) without our prior written consent, save that it may be included as exhibit 5.2 to the Registration Statement.

d)
                 
We have been retained as special Swiss legal counsel to the Guarantor to advise on legal aspects (but not tax aspects) of the transaction contemplated by the Subject Agreements, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and therefore we express no opinion on tax or accounting matters in relation to the transactions contemplated by the Subject Agreements, the Securities, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
e)
                  
Where a person is vested with a discretion or may determine a matter in his or its opinion, such discretion may have to be exercised reasonably or such an opinion may have to be based on reasonable grounds.
 
f)
                    
In this opinion, Swiss legal concepts are expressed in English terms and not in their original Swiss language; the concepts concerned may not be identical to the concepts described by the same English terms as they exist under the laws of other jurisdictions; this opinion may, therefore, only be relied upon on the condition that any issues of interpretation or liability arising hereunder will be governed by Swiss law and be brought before a Swiss court.
 
This opinion speaks as of its date and is strictly limited to the matters stated herein and we assume no obligation to review or update this opinion if applicable law or the existing facts or circumstances should change. This opinion is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with Swiss law. It is given on the basis that it will not give rise to any legal proceedings with respect thereto in any jurisdiction other than Switzerland.
