FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
SCHAFFHAUSEN, Switzerland  Apr. 25, 2012  TE Connectivity Ltd.
(NYSE: TEL) today reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended March 30, 2012.  The company reported net sales of $3.25 billion compared to prior year sales of $3.34 billion.  Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (GAAP EPS) were $0.62 for the quarter which included $0.05 of restructuring and other charges and $0.01 of acquisition-related charges.
 
Adjusted EPS were $0.68, equal to the prior year and above guidance of $0.62 to $0.66.  Free cash flow was $379 million for the quarter.
 
Total company orders were $3.3 billion in the second quarter.  The book-to-bill ratio was 1.01 overall, and 1.03 excluding the Subsea Communications business.
 
"We had a strong quarter in our Transportation Solutions segment and adjusted operating margins improved in all of our segments when compared to last quarter," said TE Connectivity Chief Executive Officer Tom Lynch.  "In the third quarter, we expect sequential earnings growth to exceed 15% due to double-digit sales increases in our CIS and Networks segments and the addition of Deutsch.  We anticipate operating margins to be about 14% in the second half of our year and full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.88 to $2.98."
 
2012 OUTLOOK
 
For the third quarter, the Company expects net sales of $3.55 to $3.65 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.77 to $0.81.  GAAP EPS are expected to be $0.58 to $0.62, including restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.19.
 
For the full year, the Company expects sales of $13.5 to $13.8 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.88 to $2.98.  GAAP EPS are expected to be $2.50 to $2.60 including restructuring and acquisition-related charges of
$0.38.  This outlook compares to fiscal 2011 revenue of $13.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.95 excluding the additional week in 2011.
 
The Company's outlook assumes current foreign exchange and commodity rates and includes the recently completed acquisition of Deutsch Group SAS.  The Company's Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses are included in discontinued operations for all periods.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
 
"Organic Sales Growth," "Adjusted Operating Income," "Adjusted Operating Margin," "Adjusted Other Income, Net," "Adjusted Income Tax Expense," "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations," "Adjusted Earnings Per Share," and "Free Cash Flow" (FCF) are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results.
 
"Organic Sales Growth" is a useful measure used by us to measure the underlying results and trends in the business.  The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and Organic Sales Growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, if any, and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length.  Organic Sales Growth is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that: i) are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; or ii) do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our sales.  This limitation is best addressed by using organic sales growth in combination with the GAAP results.
 
We present operating income before special items including charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any ("Adjusted Operating Income").  We utilize Adjusted Operating Income to assess segment level core operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and underlying market conditions.  It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.  Adjusted Operating Income is a useful measure for investors because it provides insight into our underlying operating results, trends, and the comparability of these results between periods.  The difference between Adjusted Operating Income and operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any, that may mask the underlying operating results and/or business trends.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported operating income.  This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Operating Income in combination with operating income (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
 
We present operating margin before special items including charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, and other income or charges, if any ("Adjusted Operating Margin").  We present Adjusted Operating Margin before special items to give investors a perspective on the underlying business results.  It also is a significant
 
component in our incentive compensation plans.  This measure should be considered in conjunction with operating margin calculated using our GAAP results in order to understand the amounts, character and impact of adjustments to operating margin.
 
We present other income, net before special items including tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, if any ("Adjusted Other Income, Net").  We present Adjusted Other Income, Net as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.  The difference between Adjusted Other Income, Net and other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, if any.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease other income, net.  This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Other Income, Net in combination with other income, net (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
We present income tax expense after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including charges related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, other income or charges, and certain significant special tax items, if any ("Adjusted Income Tax Expense").  We present Adjusted Income Tax Expense to provide investors further information regarding the tax effects of adjustments used in determining the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations (as defined below).  The difference between Adjusted Income Tax Expense and income tax expense (the most comparable GAAP measure) is the tax effect of adjusting items and certain significant special tax items, if any.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease income tax expense.  This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Income Tax Expense in combination with income tax expense (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
We present income from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. before special items including charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, related tax effects ("Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations").  We present Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations as we believe that it is appropriate for investors to consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations provides additional information regarding our underlying operating results, trends and the comparability of these results between periods.  The difference between Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and income from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) consists of the impact of charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, related tax effects.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results.  This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations in combination with income from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.
 
We present diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. before special items, including charges or income related to legal settlements and reserves, restructuring and other charges, acquisition related charges, impairment charges, tax sharing income related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period tax returns and other tax items, certain significant special tax items, other income or charges, if any, and, if applicable, related tax effects ("Adjusted Earnings Per Share").  We present Adjusted Earnings Per Share because we believe that it is appropriate for investors to
 
consider results excluding these items in addition to results in accordance with GAAP.  We believe such a measure provides a picture of our results that is more comparable among periods since it excludes the impact of special items, which may recur, but tend to be irregular as to timing, thereby making comparisons between periods more difficult.  It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.  The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results.  This limitation is best addressed by using Adjusted Earnings Per Share in combination with diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to TE Connectivity Ltd. (the most comparable GAAP measure) in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.
 
"Free Cash Flow" (FCF) is a useful measure of our performance and ability to generate cash.  It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.  The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and FCF (the non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify.  We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations.  The difference reflects the impact from net capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, and special items, if any.
 
Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments.  Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity.  Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters, also are considered by management in evaluating free cash flow.  We believe investors should consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow.  We forecast our cash flow results excluding any voluntary pension contributions because we have not yet made a determination about the amount and timing of any such future contributions.  In addition, our forecast excludes the cash impact of special items because we cannot predict the amount and timing of such items.
 
FCF as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.  The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our GAAP cash flow.  Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates.  This limitation is best addressed by using FCF in combination with the GAAP cash flow results.  It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments.  In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow.
 
Because we do not predict the amount and timing of special items that might occur in the future, and our forecasts are developed at a level of detail different than that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures, we do not provide reconciliations to GAAP of our forward-looking financial measures.
