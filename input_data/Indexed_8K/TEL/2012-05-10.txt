On May 10, 2012, TE Connectivity Ltd. (the "Company") announced that it has scheduled an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the "EGM") to be held on July 25, 2012 in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.

Such proposal must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") relating to shareholders' proposals.
 
The Company's Articles of Association contain an advance notice of shareholder business requirement (Article 14 of the Articles of Association), which generally prescribes the procedures that a shareholder of the Company must follow if the shareholder intends to propose any business to be considered by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders. These procedures include, among other things, that the shareholder give timely notice to the Secretary of the Company of the proposed business, that the notice contain specified information, and that the shareholder comply with certain other requirements. In accordance with the Articles of Association relating to an extraordinary general meeting, notice by the shareholder must be delivered to or mailed and received at the registered office of the Company by the date which is 10 calendar days after the date of announcement of the date of the EGM.  The date of the EGM was announced on May 10, 2012.  Accordingly, if a shareholder of the Company intends to propose any business at the EGM, the shareholder must deliver a notice of such proposal to the Company's Secretary not later than 5:00 p.m., Central European Summer Time (11:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time) on May 21, 2012, and comply with the requirements of the Articles of Association.
 
Notices should be addressed in writing to: Harold G. Barksdale, Secretary, TE Connectivity Ltd., Rheinstrasse 20, CH-8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland.
 
No prior notice is required to bring proposals prior to or at a general meeting of shareholders where such proposals relate to items that are already included on the agenda for that meeting.
