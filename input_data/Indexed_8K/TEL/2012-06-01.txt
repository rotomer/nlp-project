Item 5.03.    Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
        As previously reported, at the annual general meeting of TE Connectivity Ltd. (the "Company") held on March 7, 2012, the Company's shareholders approved the equivalent of a dividend payment in the form of a distribution to shareholders through a reduction of par value of 0.80 Swiss francs (CHF) per share payable in four equal installments, starting with the third fiscal quarter of 2012 and ending in the second fiscal quarter of 2013. The first installment of the distribution will be paid in US dollars equal to US$0.21 per share on June 15, 2012 to the Company's shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2012.
        The Company's amended and restated Articles of Association, reflecting the first installment of the par value reduction of CHF 0.20 per share, became effective upon their filing with the commercial register of the Canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland on June 1, 2012 and, as a result, the par value of each share of the Company is now CHF 1.17.
        A copy of the Company's amended and restated Articles of Association is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
