PRESS RELEASE
 
BOSTON  (Business Wire)  July 15, 2003  Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) reported sales of $331.5 million for the second quarter of 2003, and a net loss on a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis of $52.5 million, or $0.28 per share. The pro forma net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was $35.4 million, or $0.19 per share before asset impairments, workforce reductions, facility closures and the impact of accelerated depreciation. Net orders increased 5% from the previous quarter, to $305 million.
 
"Orders in our Semiconductor Test business strengthened significantly and were at their highest level in 10 quarters," said George Chamillard, Teradyne Chairman and CEO. "That increased order level is being driven by demand for high-end System On a Chip (SOC) applications. Our growth in semiconductor test orders was partially offset by our other businesses, however, where orders were down sequentially. In our cost reduction program, we made good progress in the quarter toward our goal of returning to profitability."
 
"For the third quarter, we expect sales to be between $310 and $340 million, and that our loss per share will be reduced to between 11 and 19 cents, on a pro forma basis. This EPS range assumes that we will have no tax benefit in the quarter."

Pro Forma Results
 
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Teradyne also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. Teradyne reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the pro forma measure helps indicate underlying trends in Teradyne's business, and management uses pro forma measures to plan and forecast future periods and to establish operational goals.
 
Earnings guidance is provided only on a pro forma basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges, such as some amount of severance due to workforce reductions, other additional charges excluded from the pro forma measure are dependent on numerous presently unknown factors. For example, further goodwill or real estate impairment charges are dependent upon future market conditions and valuations that are not presently determinable.
 
Pro forma information is not determined using GAAP and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures or data prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Safe Harbor Statement
 
Some statements in this release are forward-looking statements made under Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions established by securities legislation, are based on the assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management at the time such statements are made. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees but involve risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause Teradyne's financial results to differ materially from our expectations. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our revenue and profit and loss expectations, our future business strategies and market opportunities, improvements in our business, backlog and design-ins, demand for our products and the general economic outlook. Among the factors that could cause results to differ from expectations are the following: recurrent downturn or slower recovery in market demand for electronics (including especially the markets for semiconductor and telecommunications equipment) which has been affected by the economic slowdown that began in 2000; uncertainty and adverse changes in general economies worldwide; the impact of the war in Iraq, geopolitical turmoil and the threat of terrorist attacks; the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the international marketplace; uncertainty regarding the future growth rate of worldwide economies, which has caused many companies to reduce or delay capital investment; technological and market changes; Teradyne's ability to protect its intellectual property; the historically cyclical nature of the markets that Teradyne serves; new product development and delays; uncertainty of customer acceptance of new orders; decisions by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; the presence of intense competition throughout the world in each of our operating segments from substantial competitors; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures, including facility consolidations, employee reductions, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing and engineering activities; the possibility of intense price competition and the resulting prospect of having to lower our prices and therefore possibly our revenue; the impact of and our ability to manage the effects of past or future acquisitions or divestitures; the class action securities litigation brought against Teradyne; the increase in our debt service obligations and debt to capital ratio resulting from our issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes and $45 million in mortgage financing that we obtained in 2001; the availability of additional financing; the impact of being required to account for stock options as an expense; the ability to attract and retain key employees; the risks of potential environmental liability; the risks of operating internationally which include political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including, but not limited to, Teradyne's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
