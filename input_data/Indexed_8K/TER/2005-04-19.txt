Teradyne Announces First Quarter Results
 
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)April 19, 2005Teradyne, Inc. reported net orders of $340.7 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2004. Sales were $305.6 million for the quarter, a 19% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2004, and the company had a net loss of $52.6 million or $0.27 per share, compared to net income of $3.3 million or $0.02 per share in the previous quarter. The net loss for the first quarter of 2005 includes pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $10.6 million.
 
"Orders increased in the first quarter over the fourth quarter in what continues to be a performance-driven versus capacity-driven environment," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne President and CEO.
