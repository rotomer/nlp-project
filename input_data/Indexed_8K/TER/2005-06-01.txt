Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 26, 2005, the Board of Directors of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") approved a plan (the "Plan") to accelerate on such date the vesting of certain outstanding, unvested "out of the money" stock options awarded to employees, officers and other eligible participants under the Company's various stock option plans. The stock options that were accelerated have exercise prices that are in excess of $13.26, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 26, 2005 and range in exercise price from $13.73 to $41.37 per share. Options to purchase approximately 7.6 million shares became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration.
 
By implementing the Plan, the Company expects to reduce the effects of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's new standard, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," which requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
