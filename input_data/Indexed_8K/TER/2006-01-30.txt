2006 Variable Compensation Plan
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Teradyne, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Variable Compensation Plan for 2006 (the "2006 VC Plan"). Pursuant to the 2006 VC Plan, executive officers and certain eligible senior employees (each, a "VC Participant") who are integral to the success of the business may receive a variable compensation payment from the Company as determined and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board (or the full Board in the case of the CEO). The amount of variable compensation, if any, payable to each VC Participant (other than VC Participants in the corporate division, the CEO, CFO and certain other executives) is based on business unit performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee and to the CEO, CFO and certain other executive officers is based on a weighted aggregation of the business unit performances, and, in each case, is calculated as a percentage of the VC Participant's base annual salary (the "VC Factor"). The VC Factors for new VC Participants start at 10% and with greater levels of responsibility may be as high as 200%.
 
In evaluating individual business group performance, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider various factors, including, profitability, return on net assets, market share, strategic position, overall business strategy and quantitative vital goals.
 
The Board and/or Compensation Committee may at any time, in their sole discretion, further adjust, modify or terminate the 2006 VC Plan, in full or in part.
 
The 2006 VC Plan became effective on January 26, 2006, the date of its approval by the Board. The above description of the 2006 VC Plan is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the 2006 VC Plan and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the 2006 VC Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
Restricted Stock Unit Grant Agreements
 
In connection with the first grant of restricted stock units to executive officers and directors, the Board approved on January 26, 2006, the agreement forms for restricted stock unit grants for executive officers, including the CEO (the "Executive Grant Agreement") and for the directors (the "Director Grant Agreement" and, together with the Executive Grant, the "Grant Agreements"). Awards under the Grant Agreements will be made pursuant to the Teradyne, Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan").
 
Under the terms of the Grant Agreements, awards to directors will vest after a one year period, with 100% of the award vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date. Awards to executive officers, including the CEO, will vest over two years, with 50% of the award subject to time-based vesting and 50% of the award subject to performance-based vesting. The performance criteria (which will be consistent with the performance criteria used for the 2006 VC Plan) for performance-based grants will be assessed on the first anniversary of the grant date and, in turn, determine the number of performance-based restricted stock units available for vesting over the two-year vesting period; portions of the performance-based grants not available for vesting will be forfeited.
Individuals receiving restricted stock unit awards will not have any right in, to or with respect to any shares covered by the award until the award is settled by issuance of shares to the individuals.
 
The above description of the Grant Agreements is not a complete description of all terms and conditions of the Grant Agreements and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by the forms of the Executive Grant Agreement and the Director Grant Agreement filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K.
 
Executive Compensation
 
On January 25, 2006, the Compensation Committee took the following actions regarding executive compensation:
 
 
 
 
Non-Employee Director Compensation
 
On January 26, 2006, the non-employee directors, including the Chairman of the Board, waived the annual automatic stock option grants that they would have received on February 6, 2006 under the 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (options for the purchase of 15,000 and 30,000 shares of Teradyne's common stock for the directors and the Chairman, respectively) in exchange for the restricted stock units described below.
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the grant of restricted stock units that will vest over a one year period to all non-employee directors and the Chairman of the Board. Grants to directors will have a value of $90,000 and the grant to the Chairman will
have a value of $180,000, in each case, based on the fair market value of Teradyne's common stock on the grant date. These grants of restricted stock units will be made on February 6, 2006 under the 1997 Plan. In connection with the approval by the Board of the restricted stock unit awards, the Board also approved the terms of the Director Grant Agreement, the form of which is set forth in Exhibit 10.2 and is described above.
 
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board approved resolutions that authorize management to repurchase up to an aggregate of $300 million of the of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due October 15, 2006 (the "Notes"), which sum represents the remaining outstanding amount of the Notes, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and/or auctions for a price not to exceed 100% of the principal amount of the Notes.
 
On January 26, 2006, the Board approved a new policy regarding director election in the form of an amendment to the Teradyne, Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines"). This modification to the Guidelines was implemented as a part of the Company's continuing efforts to enhance corporate governance procedures. Under the modified Guidelines, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Governance Committee or another committee of the Board (the "Committee") will consider the resignation offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept it. The board will act on the Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Thereafter, the Board will promptly disclose their decision relative to the tendered resignation in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. The amended Guidelines became effective immediately upon its adoption by the Board. A copy of the Guidelines, as amended and restated, is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The Variable Compensation Plan ("VC Plan") provides a variable compensation payment to the Company's executive officers and certain eligible senior employees each January based on individual business group (Divisional) performance during the prior year, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Compensation Committee) or the Board of Directors. The amount of Variable Compensation each executive officer and senior employee receives is a function of three factors:
 
 
 
 
Each executive officer's and employee's "variable compensation factor" is a percentage of his or her base annual salary, starting at 10% for new participants. At greater levels of responsibility and experience, the variable compensation factor may increase to or exceed 180% of base annual salary. Variable compensation factors are reviewed each year. A newly hired executive officer or employee, who is approved for eligibility under the VC Plan, will be eligible to receive a VC Plan payment for their first year of employment, pro-rated from the date of hire.
 
At year end, the Compensation Committee evaluates each individual Division's performance versus goals, with emphasis on the vital goals. Given the dynamics of the business, the Company's VC Plan relies heavily on the Compensation Committee's or Board of Director's evaluation and assessment of performance. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee determines whether any variable compensation should be paid and, if so, the amount for distribution, except that the full Board of Directors determines whether any variable compensation should be paid to the CEO and, if so, the amount. The payments under the VC Plan will be made only after approval by the Compensation Committee and/or Board of Directors.
 
The following factors are considered in evaluating individual Divisional performance: (1) the extent to which quantitative and qualitative plans were met for the
year, with an emphasis on profitability, return on net assets and market share; (2) the extent to which process improvement results were achieved; (3) the extent to which yearly results verified each Division's strategy and improved its strategic position; and (4) the extent to which each Division's yearly mid-term plan and strategy was credible and contributed to the Company's ability to adapt to changes in the marketplace or environment.
 
Administrative rules and procedures for the VC Plan are maintained, monitored and implemented by the Company's Human Resources department.
 
The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to interpret and apply the terms of this VC Plan, including the determination of whether any particular employee will receive a payment, and the amount of any such payment. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reserve the right to adjust, modify or terminate the VC Plan, in full or in part, at any time, in its sole discretion. Subject to an amendment to or termination of this VC Plan by the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, this VC Plan shall commence in 2006 and renew annually each year thereafter.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of (the "Company") has adopted the following Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to assist the Board in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities and to serve the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Guidelines should be applied in a manner consistent with all applicable laws and stock exchange rules and the Company's charter and bylaws, each as amended and in effect from time to time. The Guidelines provide a framework for the conduct of the Board's business. The Board may modify or make exceptions to the Guidelines from time to time in its discretion and consistent with its duties and responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders.
