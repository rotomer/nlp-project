Exhibit 99.1
Teradyne Announces Third Quarter 2006 Results
BOSTON(BUSINESS WIRE)October 18, 2006Teradyne, Inc. reported sales of $359 million for the third quarter of 2006. Net income in the quarter was $60.6 million, or $0.31 per share. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was $64.5 million, or $0.33 per share on a GAAP basis, and $46.0 million, or $0.24 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Bookings for the third quarter were $239 million.
"We had another solid quarter of financial performance with strong gross margins and record cash flow," said Mike Bradley, Teradyne president and CEO. "After almost two years of expansion, our customers have pulled back as expected. However, with more than 1,000 FLEX systems installed at customers, and with tight cost controls in place, we are well positioned for the next phase of industry growth."
Sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 are expected to be between $255 million and $275 million, with earnings per diluted share between $0.01 and $0.05.
During the third quarter of 2006, Teradyne repurchased 8.5 million shares of its common stock for $110 million under its previously announced Stock Repurchase Program.
In addition, on October 16, 2006, Teradyne paid off the outstanding balance, approximately $261 million aggregate principal amount, of its 3.75% Senior Convertible Notes due 2006 in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes.
Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. A reconciliation of each GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

Safe Harbor Statement
The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date of publication and Teradyne undertakes no obligation to update the information set forth in this release.
This release contains forward-looking statements regarding expected future revenues and earnings, future market conditions and business prospects. Such statements are based on the current assumptions and expectations of Teradyne's management and are neither promises nor guarantees. You can generally identify these forward-looking statements based on the context of the statements and by the fact that they use words such as "will," "anticipate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "target," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. There can be no assurance that management's estimates of our future results will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presently expected include: adverse changes in general economic or market conditions (including market demand for electronics and downturns in the semiconductor industry); the historically cyclical nature and volatility of the markets that we serve; the "hockey-stick" pattern of sales resulting in a disproportionately large percentage of total quarterly sales occurring in the last month and weeks of each quarter; the decision by customers to cancel or defer orders that previously had been accepted; reduced bookings; reductions or delays in capital investment by our customers; competitive pressures (including pricing and gross margin pressures); the risks of operating internationally (including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements and in policy changes affecting international markets); disruptions, delays or shortages in an adequate supply of raw materials, components or internal and external manufacturing capability; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; incoming quality of components or raw materials; insufficient or excess inventory; the effectiveness of our implementation of cost cutting and expense control measures (including facility consolidations, the centralization of certain shared services, seeking lower prices from suppliers and the outsourcing of selected manufacturing, information technology and engineering activities); the risks of potential environmental liability; any material litigation against Teradyne; the ability to attract and retain key employees; war or the threat of terrorist attacks; and other events, factors and risks previously and from time to time disclosed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and our periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding restructuring and other charges, net, and certain inventory provisions. GAAP requires that these costs and charges be included in determining Net Income/(Loss) and Net Income/(Loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and credits, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.
