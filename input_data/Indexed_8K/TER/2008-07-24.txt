Bookings for the second quarter were $308 million.
"Our System-On-a-Chip (SOC) test business further strengthened in the second quarter, driven by record first-half demand in wireless test applications, however we saw a softening in memory test capacity-driven orders," said Mike Bradley Teradyne president and CEO.

Non-GAAP Results
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, Teradyne also discloses non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain income items and charges. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Teradyne reports non-GAAP results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. Management believes the non-GAAP measures help indicate Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside Teradyne's ongoing operating results. Teradyne believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of its results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how Teradyne plans and measures its own business. Teradyne's earnings per share guidance is only provided on a non GAAP basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and
quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Although Teradyne expects certain known charges, such as intangible asset amortization expense, other additional charges excluded from the non-GAAP measure are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events and unknown factors, such as the sale of a facility. A reconciliation of each available GAAP to non-GAAP financial measure discussed in this press release is contained in the attached Exhibits and on the Teradyne website at by clicking on "Investors" and then selecting the "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation" link. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures or information provided in accordance with GAAP.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Earnings Reconciliation
References by the Company to non-GAAP income and non-GAAP income per share refer to income from operations, income from continuing operations or income per common share from continuing operations excluding in-process research and development, restructuring and other, net, certain inventory provisions and fair value adjustment related to Nextest, interest and other, net, and acquired intangible asset amortization, as well as adjustments to profit sharing and income taxes due to these exclusions. GAAP requires that these items be included in determining income from operations and income from continuing operations. Non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP income from continuing operations (which is the basis for non-GAAP income per share) gives an indication of Teradyne's baseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.
