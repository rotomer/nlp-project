As a result of the transfer of manufacturing to its outsourced partner and in furtherance of Teradyne, Inc.'s ("Teradyne") continuing plan to reduce its quarterly breakeven level, on September 4, 2008, Teradyne completed the sale of two buildings in North Reading, MA and determined that a non-cash impairment charge would result from such sale. In conjunction with the sale, Teradyne is leasing back one building for nine months and approximately 45% of the square footage of the second building for five years. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $26 million from the sale of the buildings and estimates that a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $27 million will be recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, which ends on September 28, 2008.
